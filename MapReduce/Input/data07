re wfan i hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment of wfan and wip i go to school in philadelphia and i listen to both stations on a consistant basis now that the fan has mike lupica on from to noon they have a person who can get the big name guests for interviews and not just of local importance he did have dave cheketts and fred wilpon on his show but he had bob costas and magic johnson on too now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent morning show in my opinion i think imus is much better than bruno cataldi and morganti even though i would feel different if morganti had a better crew of people to work with to me wip tries to copy imus but make it all sports as a theme in terms of sports imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves but he interjects humor and politics into his show am to noon i think chuck cooperstein and lupica are equal in their abilities to host a radio show but i think chuck has the advantage over lupica in terms of dealing with the caller who is asking about who the local team is going to draft in the sixth round lupica and the other hosts on fan get better interview guests but i heard the pd of wip say that they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless it was a major story i would consider this even because they are two different styles of host noon to pm at this point i would have to give a big advantage to jody mcdonald over len berman because lenny has only been on for a couple of weeks i just think jm has the ability to transcend the homer mentality of the philadelphia fan base this is most evident when the iggles philadelphia spelling play the cowboys because jm is a huge dallas fan where else can you have people call up and predict a score without the egging of the hosts re wip morning guys i do agree that jm was great on the fan weekend overnight and i miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating hosts i feel that jm is the best sportstalk host on either station by a good margin if you are in ny and you can t get wip jm does fill in on the weekends sometimes pm to pm this is the time when jm goes up against francesa and russo fatso and froot loops and i become the most divided in my loyalties mike and the dog are very entertaining but they often go an hour or so without calls or even to minutes without talking about sports matd do get great guests and that is the basis for their show so it is like the to debate another plus is the appearances by mike and chris on imus in the morning which are often hilarious pm to pm matd go up against fredericks and missanelli i like mike missanelli but i just can t stomach steve fredericks i know that sf came from philly originally but when he was at the fan he was a ny homer as much as he is a philly homer now i don t listen to wip much after pm unless there is a game on that night but you will see later for the reason that is why i give the advantage to fan pm to midnight s m are on wip until and then it is the man who makes eli that calls matd all the time seem like a novice on charges of racism g cobb this man is so grating on my nerves that if i listen to him for a few minutes i go nuts i know that is biased but listen to his show on fan there is usually a game on knicks rangers mets jets or st john s basketball if the game is on the west coast then it is usually howie rose of course i think dead air would be better than g cobb on wip but wip does air sixers and flyers games during the season if this is the sports station why did they lose the iggles to wysp home of howard stern in phil during the summer it is all talk on wip overall i would have to give the advantage to wfan with the exception of to and to where it is even and to where wip has the advantage rich you ve read the hat now see the movie imus in the morning a blurb you re a blurb seinfeld

re infield fly rule jrogoff scott skidmore edu jay rogoff writes one last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and hasn t yet been addressed i believe the rule also does not deal with this situation however if the infield fly is not caught at what point can a runner legally leave his base w o fear of being doubled off for advancing too early the runner can leave his base at any time if the ball is caught he s got to tag up if it isn t caught he doesn t have to tag up at all so if he s feeling lucky your runner at second can sprint for glory as soon as the ball is popped up if it isn t caught he s probably scored a run if it is he s probably headed for aaa the only effect the infield fly has is to make the batter out thereby removing the force on the runners on base all other rules apply as if you were standing second with first open and the ball is popped up tim shippert shippert cco caltech edu if we are going to stick to this damned quantum jumping then i regret that i ever had anything to do with quantum theory e schrodinger

bonds vs maddux i ve been following the giants closely over the off season newspapers notesgroup etc but i had my first up close and personal last night at the stick after watching giants hitters struggle last year barry s swing was very impressive he s very quick and his swing seems effortless even compared to clark particularly clark as of late it was interesting to see bonds hit maddux so well i m not sure if barry was after revenge against the braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits b b hr for rbi s the giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to bonds there has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better clayton s defense has been superb mcgee seems to like leading off this year manwaring is driving the ball so on so forth i hope it continues i think they need to continue well into june before people are really sold that they are for real particularly the pitching for myself i think the fresh start of magowan baker etc has really wiped out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor in helping them significantly improve over last year joe loos loos cup hp com

re darrrrrrrrryl mark singer brings up the strawberry incident where he lost a homerun and the fan caught it before each dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any that are in the field of play was the fan wrong should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference yes i think he should have done more to get out of the way as much as fans want to catch a ball they really should be aware that winning the game is more important as a dodger fan he has to be aware that this is the home stadium and that entails helping the home team win in any way possible as soon as the ball was hit that far his first instinct should be to root for darryl to catch it not to try to catch it himself particularly when he is sitting that close i enjoy the attitude of the wrigley fans where they are against visiting team home runs so much they actually throw them back on the field now this has nothing to do with whether darryl could have caught it or not sure he probably screwed up but the fan should realize his first responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win daniel daniel caldera usc edu

sellouts yet they hadn t made the playoffs since how do you explain a th place team breaking attendance records when they haven t been to the playoffs in years mario lemieux is the explanation imho you could make a case that the expectation of an improving team that would make the playoffs is the reason funny you should mention it this is exactly the case i was going to make but i think the reason is lemieux had a point season and was the first non gretzky to win the hart and ross since people turned out to watch him play i will grant that a star like mario will draw fans even if the team sucks but this is short term only i still do not think the attendance increase will last unless the team is a winning competitive improving butt kicking one pittsburgh was still getting better so people continued to support them if they suddenly dropped to say points you d have knee surgery for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon also the following year the pens had points not ok my numbers came from the nhl guide and record book they made the transaction to try and build a winner around mario that is true but the improvement in attendance came before they started doing this coffey late in and before they even had a playoff bound team a doubling of attendance occured in from the previous year an increase from points to points is not going to do that the arrival of mario lemieux is what did it you can give the credit to mario since he deserves it but my point is that it wasn t mario himself but it was the expectation of things to come i e a winning team that he created by being the next great hockey superstar and before anybody jumps in and says i m nit picking and mincing words go back and read from where this thread started it might help to think about what would go through a fan s mind who suddenly found an interest in mario and the pens was it gee mario lemieux is amazing i ll go watch him play or was it gee now we ve got a kick ass guy on our side i ll go watch him play i think it was the latter similar thing happened in l a before gretzky s arrival about per game after constant sellouts they are still selling out every game despite showing little or no improvement since gretzky s first year there how do you explain it people are going to see gretzky they certainly aren t going to see a winner they haven t got a winner they ve had much better teams in their past history than they currently have yet they didn t draw as well then i don t think this is accurate the tickets sell but people don t go to the games i think this thread has already been discussed season ticket holders in la don t always use their tickets so in effect after the kings initial success following gretzky s arrival to points same source and corresponding attendance jump there has been an effective drop in attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much whether or not the kings are a winner is debatable i claim that since gretzky s arrival they have at the very least been competitive i also claim that mcnall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the oiler dynasty but that s another story and included only because i don t like mcnall anyway mcnall did do some heavy marketing around gretzky and that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising sales etc but as i said when the kings have been in there little tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the forum even if the tickets were sold i think in the case of a lemieux or gretzky the player can transcend winning as the major drawing power for the short term imo although i think that it s inevitable that the team will improve with a player such as lemieux or gretzky simply because they make people around them better but winning sure as hell helps well at least we are in full agreement here this does not make roger s point any more valid but the jets aren t so are you saying roger has ever had a valid point couldn t resist getting a huge jump in productivity yet they are getting a huge jump in attendance this is due to the emergence of teemu selanne they have the th best record in hockey it sure as hell isn t because they are winning yes but they are doing no worse than last year i think the same type of reasoning i applied to a new pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people showing up at winnipeg games it s difficult to predict but do you think that if the jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they will maintain their attendance levels i seriously doubt it because in that case the expectation of an improving team would be gone with or without selanne i did provide the example of rocket ismail and the toronto argonauts of the cfl did you leave it out because you don t know much about the cfl if that s the case then fair enough but if it isn t the case then i m curious to hear your explanation
re nhl team leaders in in article mar ramsey cs laurentian ca maynard ramsey cs laurentian ca roger maynard writes the jets use the breakaway pass scheme to create a scoring sensation in order to generate interest if teams score as many or more goals against winnipeg when selanne is on the ice as winnipeg scores when he is on the ice then i can t see how his contribution can be described as impressive implicitly you are assuming that goals scored against winnipeg with selanne on the ice can be blamed on him roger he is a forward winnipeg has a lousy defensive record anyway let s put it another way john cullen s is terrible what s your excuse for him that his powerplay points don t count neither do selanne s the object of the game is not to feed selanne it is to win and feeding selanne does not contribute in any meaningful way to winning knowledgeable hockey observers the world over would agree that feeding selanne so he can score does contribute in a meaningful way to winning pat burns wouldn t have a goal suck like this on his team you re worried about teemu when you have glenn anderson on your team we don t know what selanne does best we do know what jet s management wants and again the object of the exercise is not to allow selanne to do what he does best it is to win hockey games what he does best is score so i refer you to my comment above as it is now selanne is a grandstanding goal suck did you see the way he parades around with his arms outstretched after scoring a goal you would think the messiah had returned nope didn t see it i was too busy watching foligno jump up and down after his goal
re this year s biggest and worst opinion i can only comment on the kings but the most obvious candidate for pleasant surprise is alex zhitnik he came highly touted as a defensive defenseman but he s clearly much more than that great skater and hard shot though wish he were more accurate in fact he pretty much allowed the kings to trade away that huge defensive liability paul coffey kelly hrudey is only the biggest disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with but at best he s only a mediocre goaltender a better choice would be tomas sandstrom though not through any fault of his own but because some thugs in toronto decided to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal other than that the award goes to robert lang an uninspiring czech robitaille could easily be mvp but i d prefer to give it to rob blake who is quietly becoming one of the league s premier defensemen and if the kings manage to hold onto him and the rest of our young defense it could one day mean that we ll let in fewer goals than hartford honorable mentions to majestic marty and warren rychel jon

re playoff predictions in article pn qhinnsm senator bedfellow mit edu boudreau athena mit edu carol v boudreau writes in the smythe this one is the toughest for me to call because i have to put personal bias aside go calgary i think a lot depends on who wins the division winnipeg will move into third by the end of the season and the first place winner will have a clear advantage it will be a lot easier to build momentum against a team like the kings whoever plays the kings in the first round will take the division much as it hurts i have to pick division winner vancouver canucks i ll have to disagree with you on this one i think vancouver will go as bure goes and if he continues on his goal scoring slump then they won t even make it out of the first round i think the kings will make it out of the first round regardless of who they play they seem to be doing pretty well even with that bad game against minnesota on saturday i think it ll be either calgary or los angeles to win the smythe i e go on to the conference finals wales conference trophy islanders and bruins will fight to the end but i think the islanders have enough steam to overtake the bruins in seven campbell conference trophy a walk for vancouver maybe in or but definately not stanley cup final islanders and vancouver islanders will have nothing left by this point and will succumb fairly easily to the canucks stanley cup champion vancouver canucks still have to disagree with you here i think it ll be pittsburg to get the hat trick in stanley cups they just look toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good i hope you have enjoyed my predictions i hope they are not all correct go calgary neither do i well may the best team win it all pittsburg that s just my worth message from the terminal of carol boudreau boudreau athena mit edu

flyers notes the flyers team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the spectrum sunday night and dominated the maple leafs thoroughly en route to a shutout tommy soderstrom will get credit for the shutout but he barely broke a sweat until the third period as the flyers defense kept the leafs from mounting any serious attack injuries pelle eklund is day to day with a bruised thigh roster moves jason bowen was added to the lineup for his first nhl game jason was the flyers second pick in the first round th overall of the entry draft years old lbs in games with the tri city americans he had goals assists and pim he plays left wing and defense he played defense in this game although bobby taylor said that bill dineen was planning to use him up front as well andre faust was returned to hershey he actually left after the second period of the kings game flew to albany got the game tying goal in a bears ot win and played again for hershey sunday night lines fedyk lindros recchi beranek brind amour dineen lomakin butsayev conroy acton brown galley mcgill yushkevich cronin carkner hawgood bowen tommy soderstrom in goal acton replaced lomakin in the rd period game summary if the flyers played like this every night they d be in the playoffs this year the flyers hit everything that moved they created scoring chance after scoring chance they snuffed out everything that the leafs tried to do jason bowen made a good play on his first nhl shift that almost created a goal he had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone but instead of taking the shot he found brind amour crashing the net on the other side a perfect pass and a good shot across daren puppa s body should have been a goal but puppa made a great save reading the play garry galley gave the maple leafs th ranked power play the first chance when he hooked doug gilmour at the flyers lowly st ranked penalty killing unit was almost flawless the entire game and set the tone on this kill the maple leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots and the defense swept away every rebound after the power play the flyers got a goal on an ugly play rod brind amour gave the puck to greg hawgood at the right point and he sent a drive at the net puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of josef beranek and bob rouse who were wrestling in the slot beranek was able to get his stick on the puck and push it out to dineen who was skating into the slot from the right circle and he lifted a backhander over puppa for a flyers lead at the flyers kept the pressure on and puppa was the only leaf keeping the flyers from building on their lead for a while eventually things settled down and defense prevailed each team got an occasional scoring chance but the goalies were strong bowen started giving some lindros like checks in his own corners then lindros who was looking to avenge a hit foligno gave him thought he had a chance to even the score he had foligno lined up at center ice leaned into him and rode him into the center ice boards the only problem was that foligno was a little far from the boards and mike mister mcgeough felt that it warranted a boarding call at the leafs couldn t get anything going on the power play as the flyers were very aggressive for a change on the kill with time running out in the period recchi carried through the neutral zone and handed to lindros as they approached the leaf s blue line they were in a crowd with wendell clark and jamie macoun lindros tried a backhand pass to recchi through the feet of macoun that connected to recchi but then clark checked recchi off the puck macoun then tried to clear but it was weak and went right to mcgill who had manned the point he drove it from just inside the blue line macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own goalie at shots were flyers in the period the flyers finally got their first chance on the power play when dave andreychuk tripped up rod brind amour in his offensive zone during the power play the flyers got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and eric gloved it down but mcgeough thought it hit his stick above his head we could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove and the replay confirmed but the faceoff went to the other end as time was running out in the advantage lindros found galley with a pass across the goal mouth but puppa made the save the rebound kicked back to the right corner where recchi picked it up passed it out to eric crashing through the right circle and eric one timed past puppa at with the assist recchi moves past bobby clarke s season the second best one season total for a flyer at eric moves up to th all time in flyers rookie scoring with points mike eastwood took down al conroy at to give the flyers another chance on the power play not much pressure before garry galley ended the power play with a slash at not much happened on the on although the leafs had most of the possession the flyers smothered the leafs short power play tempers flared a little at bowen and pearson got roughing minors keith acton got a bloody face dave mcllwain then took a dive and got greg hawgood a hooking minor at to set up a on the replay showed that hawgood s stick stopped making contact with mcllwain long before he spun around and fell again the flyers smothered the leafs power play led by dimitri yushkevich bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on pearson berehowski tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball he had the puck at the point and just trickled a pass down the slot he made all the flyers look silly as nobody could get a stick on it and it got to gilmour at the side of the net but soderstrom stoned him the flyers picked things up offensively after the kill was over but didn t get anything home shots were flyers the flyers were content with the goal lead in the third period and they decided that if tommy wanted a shutout he was going to have to work for it a little the flyers got most of the scoring chances in the first or so minutes of the period but couldn t get past puppa then the leafs got tired of lindros making road kill out of them and tempers flared each for doug gilmour and lindros unsportsmanlike conduct and each for glenn anderson and mcgill roughing all at terry carkner then took a kneeing penalty at on gilmour again the flyers smothered the leafs power play at about the minute mark dave andreychuk got a shot away from his left circle that got through soderstrom the puck was rolling on it s side and as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards it think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the other seconds later rod brind amour tripped up gilmour at to give the leafs another chance on the power play on the advantage after soderstrom stoned andreychuk while lying down andreychuk got the rebound through soderstrom but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept away by one of his defensemen they kept the pressure on but soderstrom was equal and preserved the shutout recchi cross checked ken baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl at no punches thrown recchi got the initial minor krushelnyski baumgartner and lindros each got roughing minors at rouse and beranek expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got each for slashing to set up another on mike eastwood shoved down ryan mcgill in the flyers zone as they were battling for the puck and while mcgill was down he ran his stick across mcgill s face the flyers were not happy with that at all al conroy paired up with berehowski and started throwing punches upward well al held his own much to the delight of the crowd each got a couple punches in before going down in a head and al got a standing o penalties eastwood cross check game clark carkner each berehowski and conroy each fighting at so a major penalty for the rest of the game for the flyers the had no interest in stting on the lead hawgood galley and brind amour played catch until hawgood found dineen all alone in the left circle he controlled the puck and blasted it past puppa at that was all the fireworks tommy soderstrom would not face another shot puppa did but kept the flyers off the board flyers shots were flyers in the rd probably the strongest game i ve seen from the flyers since the all star break shutout number for soderstrom all since tied for nd most in the nhl but he s played fewer games than belfour or the goalie i can t remember that he s tied with next up it s the winnipeg selannes tuesday night in winnipeg the flyers cannot be eliminated if they win but a loss coupled with an islander win that night in washington would be the official end flyers up to points on the season in games last year they had points in games under so they need at least points in their last games to improve on that only by percentage points under in is better than under in tragic number holds at points with games left the tragic number for th is points i watched the rangers blow a third period lead at home to lose before i finished this up why points instead of well the flyers will win the tie breaker if they catch them whereas the islanders win tie breakers against the flyers and so need only a tie the rangers could crumble down the stretch as they play the devils the pens twice the flyers and finish up with games against the caps so i guess th place could be the goal for the team to focus on flyers team record watch eric lindros goals

re sad day for hockey dvb ick writes foul any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your body or stick if you get you are out for the game i ve never seen a game where one player has committed penalties something like this would require more attention by the referee unsportsmanlike contact an intentional foul this inlcludes all the current flavours of roughing fighting and boarding if you get two you are thrown out of the game and fined technical foul bad mouthing the ref by player or coach penalty shot is awarded two and you are thrown out of the game besides the penalty shot for one technical if the team gets penalties in a period the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one until the end of the period the victim gets two shots if he she was in the act of shooting when the foul ocured this works well for several reasons first penalty shots are the most exciting thing in hockey right so it follows that the more the better next when the player is setting up for a penalty shot the network can take a commercial finally with only three penalties the network announcers don meredith dick vitale john madden pat summerall and marv levy among others will be able to tell the viewers what happened before the pa announcer says it but you re creating a scoring opportunity where there might not have been one before i can see the relationship between free throws awarded after a certain number of fouls but it s obviously easier to score in basketball there are more opportunities if a basketball team scores points that s at least fifty chances made the average number of shots taken by each team in a hockey game and this is a total guess is probably around and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe of them you have some good ideas concerning the other penalties but i think that a player should be awarded a penalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was interfered with also later in the post you talked about how boring the nba game you attended was that play was stopped too often wouldn t your penalty shot rule take up more time during a hockey game matt att uva

re this year s biggest and worst opinion bryan smale smale healthy uwaterloo ca writes i was thinking about who on each of the teams were the mvps biggest surprises and biggest disappointments this year team biggest biggest team mvp surprise disappointment hartford whalers sanderson cassells corriveau my votes fwiw team mvp pat verbeek he fans on of goal mouth feeds but he still has goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary sp team captain throughout a tough couple of seasons honorable mention nick kypreos and mark janssens probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than mvp but kypreos goals pim has been the hardest working player on the team and janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker i guess i place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value biggest surprise geoff sanderson he had goals and points last season as a center then moved to left wing and has so far put up goals and points he now has a new whaler record power play goals most all coming from the right wing faceoff circle his garden spot honorable mention andrew cassels and terry yake the kiddie quartet of sanderson poulin nylander and petrovicky have been attracting the most attention but cassels is just and will score close to points this season he has quite nicely assumed the role of number one center on the team and works very well with sanderson yake bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still and will put up about goals and points this season yake like sanderson started performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing although lefty sanderson went to the left wing and righty yake went to the right side biggest disappointment hands down john cullen cullen had a disasterous point season last year his first full season after the trade cullen started the season off of summer back surgery and fell flat on his face appropriate since he spent all of his whaler career flat on his ass and whining about it cullen scored just point on games was a clubhouse malcontent commanded the powerplay to a success percentage with sanderson and sulked his way out of town worst of all his year m contract had three years left to run so no one would give up any more than the nd round draft pick the maple leafs offered to hartford honorable mention steve konroyd also subpar after signing a year m contract eric weinrich who showed flashes of competence but overall has played poorly jim mckenzie who was a much better hockey player two seasons ago than he is now and frank pietrangelo who only seemed to play well when sean burke was out for an extended period and he got to make a number of starts in a row sg a real live hartford whalers season ticket holder steveg cadkey com

re too many europeans in nhl somebody wrote i d love to see a european nhl division but can t see it happen for some time there s simply not enough fan interest at the moment in several crucial markets like germany italy and france while sweden and finland probably can t afford to shell out for tickets the way american canadian fans do call it the minnesota north stars effect scandinavians do love hockey but we prefer to watch local inexpensive hockey to the nhl the national hockey league should love the idea though pan european tv channels such as eurosport could bring in the millions the american networks likely never will pay this brings up a question i asked myself no answer when it was mentionned that the nhl could expand in europe would most of the north americans now playing in the nhl be willing to play for a team in europe i do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily interested in expanding their cultural experience to that level i know i would but i am not a pro hockey player when one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes me wonder how a european expansion could be achieved remember these lindros did not want to play in quebec for more than reasons nicholls in edmonton r courtnall wanted to be traded to la only c lemieux said he would refuse to go to edmonton earlier this year i know there are many non cultural reasons behind these but there is more some american players who played for the expos complained about the french fact and that the city was not quite like the other us cities one players wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in montreal anybody knows what happened when all these us football players moved to london spain etc for the one year of that new football league years ago i wonder what the players association thinks about going to europe myself i would like to see some european teams but what would be the best way to do it marc
sad day for hockey ee i andrew cmu edu ethan z evans writes of course penalties will have to be changed roughing chauvanistic males being aggressive slashing chauvanistic males venting frustration fighting proof that males cannot cope with their feelings no no no since all the penalties fall into three classes there should only be three penalties foul any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your body or stick if you get you are out for the game unsportsmanlike contact an intentional foul this inlcludes all the current flavours of roughing fighting and boarding if you get two you are thrown out of the game and fined technical foul bad mouthing the ref by player or coach penalty shot is awarded two and you are thrown out of the game besides the penalty shot for one technical if the team gets penalties in a period the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one until the end of the period the victim gets two shots if he she was in the act of shooting when the foul ocured this works well for several reasons first penalty shots are the most exciting thing in hockey right so it follows that the more the better next when the player is setting up for a penalty shot the network can take a commercial finally with only three penalties the network announcers don meredith dick vitale john madden pat summerall and marv levy among others will be able to tell the viewers what happened before the pa announcer says it oh one other rule when a goal is scored times a period the play cannot resume until the pa announcer announces it this way the network can sneak in a few more commercials then once the pa announcer has told them who scored the tv announcer can tell you the viewer and even have a chance of pronouncing his name right seriously though i actually went to see a nba basketball game last week for the first time in my life i was amazed how boring it was the play is so slow they actually had fans come out for things like free throw shooting contests during the period of course the laker girls get to do their routines at least times during the game and not just between periods either there is a whistle every seconds on average maybe less the game is minutes with minutes between quarters and and a minute halftime and it still takes over hours the reason for this has to be tv there is plenty of room to throw in commercials and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening on tv basketball is fairly entertaining imho but it is better to watch it on tv than to be there if this is the road the nhl is following then it truly is a sad day enough for now dvb

barasso the cheap shot master after watching the pengiuns all year and as many other teams as possible i ve really noticed an increase in tom barasso s cheap shots this year and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other goaltenders i ve also noticed that he usually gets away with it just as examples last night i noticed him elbowing scott stevens in the head which basically started the whole shoving match that got stevens scott and tocchet minute minors he also kicked john mclean of course he wasn t called for that isn t kicking an automatic match penalty and game suspension i think glenn anderson got one a few years ago for kicking gaetan duchesne in the chest there s no doubt in my mind that barasso is the dirtiest golatender since hextall he s also very good how about that tocchet head butt is there an automatic susppension that goes along with a non kicking match penalty i can t remember anymore oh the playoffs should be fun ralph
re how to beat pittsburgh from anna matyas now if we could just clone chelios s personality and transplant it into all of the defensemen on the islanders capitals and devils gerald in other words you want to turn them all into assholes so they will spend lots of time in the penalty box and get lots of misconducts and this comes from a chelios fan yeah and also be second in the team in scoring and play about minutes a game and play on the power play and kill penalties and be the best defenseman in the league i d take a whole team of chelioses if i could that way when one got a penalty the others could kill it ralph
re bruins pens the ulf neeley fight mattb hawk samsung com matt brown writes more about the messier samuelsson incident while this is true strictly speaking it was the rocksteady replicant who initially used his stick illegally to measure messier s ribcage there is no question in my mind from seeing the replay in slo mo that ulf was coming at messier with intent to hasta la vista in mind and should have been gone for that i agree with rick that ulf s cross check wasn t illegal it was the kind of check you see a dozen times during a game without being called slo mos sometimes have a tendency to make things look worse than they really are besides if messier can t take the heat he should stay out of the kitchen so staffan how is mattias timmander doing this year and any impression on markus czeriew lost my roster list on hammerby does it look like they will make it to the eliteserien for next year and then get stomped if markus goes to boston well matt mattias timmander hasn t been playing with the modo elite league team yet just the modo junior team so i predict he needs a few more years here before he can join the b s i saw him play in the swedish championship game for junior players this year and he played very well a physical game but not the kind of rough stuff that ulfie does i suspect you would like to have a ulf type of player on the b s team too as for mariusz czerkawski he has had a great season for hammarby in division he scored if i remember correctly points this season and then we have to keep in mind that a point season in sweden is considered very good due to the limited number of games mariusz is djurgarden property he was just on loan to hammarby so he will play in elitserien next season unless the b s can get him of course i would say that mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to watch in swedish hockey this season staffan staffan axelsson etxonss ufsa ericsson se r s h contact for swedish hockey
isles hockey ramblings well the patrick division got a little more interesting last night the islanders lost in ot and the devils tied the pens that means if the isles beat the devils on friday the will meet the caps in the playoffs however i have some more comments on the islanders and hockey in general that i need to get off my chest first of all with the islanders back to back lackluster performances against the whalers one may think that the islanders are out of shape these guys always suck wind in the nd period come on a little in the rd and run out of gas too soon it is unbelieveable how many one goal games these guys have lost anyway the games was pretty wide open the isles still have tons of trouble scoring the whalers played a golie in is st nhl start i think his name was lenarduzzi sp his nhl debut was the tuesday tie against the isles like i mentioned before this guy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while until he misplayed a mahlakov slap shot to go to ot i say it s because the isles don t shoot correctly has anyone else noticed this also i think it is really a shame for hockey when i guy like mick vukota gets as much ice time as he does this guy has about as much hockey talent as jiggs macdonald who did play hockey i think anytime he gets the puck it gets stolen and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties richard pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap and he s a defenseman he s got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus minus this guy gets beaten all the time why the need for such enforcers not only do fights slow the game down alot but it takes away from the guys who are really trying to play the game i ll be one of the few to admit i do enjoy a good fight once in a while but only when it s called for you know when a guy checks the goalie too hard in other words a violation of hockey ethics might cause you to get puched but there is no need to start crap when you are losing or becuase you can get away with it does anyone agree that referees need to be a little less lenient in the rd and ot i mean come on already i m sick of seeing teams pulling guys down holding guys etc just becuase the referee doesn t call it ot and late in the rd should be a time for strategy not physical prowess trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost if you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to pull a guy down to prevent it you don t deserve to win in the first place just my honest opinion gary at hofstra accgsg vaxb hofstra edu accgsg hofstra bitnet

re leaf slump over on march roger maynard wrote in reply to an article by graham hudson will still have the jennings trophy at the end of the year potvin is very good and i do believe that he will be a star but i want to see him perform in the playoffs under pressure you don t think he is performing under pressure now the major differences between playoff hockey and normal hockey is play ing every other night which is physically exhausting and you play the same team in a consecutive string of games is this what you mean by pressure have you even thought about what you mean by pressure or are your thoughts like most of the rest of this drivel simply half baked this was mar ramsey cs laurentian ca for anybody who would like to check he went on in another article to say paraphrased playoff hockey is just an expression used by announcers to convince simple minded folks like yourself that what you are seeing is a better product than a regular season game now however in article apr ramsey cs laurentian ca roger maynard writes with a win over a tough whaler squad the leafs showed all doubters what playoff hockey is all about so roger what exactly is playoff hockey all about or is it a convenient phrase to use in certain circumstances only you see when you spout off with flame bait too many times sooner or later it catches up with you
re mogilny must be benched in article c c r sq acsu buffalo edu v p nk ubvmsb cc buffalo edu andrew w korbut writes anyway this game continued a trend that has sadly been taking shape for a couple of weeks now i had hoped it was fatigue or an aberration but i can t snow myself any longer alex mogilny must be benched as a disciplinary action and soon his explanation for ysebaert jumping between him and lafontaine to score the winning goal yesterday wasn t my guy ask patty about it actually this stuff from mogilny doesn t surprise me all that much about or weeks ago i read in the toronto sun a quote from alex it went something like sarcastically yep patty s the man he s responsible for the team s success i m a nobody around here i was going to post it at the time i must have forgot since nobody else was talking about him being a problem if i heard that in the locker room i d beat the shit out of him on the spot patty took responsibility in the press taking the heat off of alex that s because lafontaine is the epitome of class and a consummate team player yep i d beat the shit out of him too lafontaine really must be a team player makes you wonder what the islander management was thinking my question is what the hell is muckler doing whether he wishes to admit it or not the team is his to coach and if he can t do the job then maybe the job should be given to somebody who can gee kinda like alex s spot on the team isn t it dr d the devils advocate
re canadians another stanley cup in article mece ryevm ryerson ca mece ryevm ryerson ca writes im sorry to tell you this but unless they pull off another miracle there is no way the habs will win this year ever since they traded for ramage and since savard came off injury they have been playing shinny and you cant blame roy for the loss to washington when players could not score one goal i know you think i am a boston fan but all of my years have been dedicated to les habs david degan well it seems that the habs have been much talked about of late so here s my these guys have absolutely no concept of how to play in front of the damn net watch them in the offensive zone especially on the powerplay damphousse or lebeau will skate all over the bloody zone maybe pass to the point get it back skate some more pass it around but where s the shot answer the shot is totally useless because they lack a forward who stands in front of the net a la neely shanahan tocchet etc etc too bad demers won t put dipietro or leclair on the powerplay more often dammit even ewen would at least cause some disruptions montreal desperately needs a power forward with some talent imo then watch them in their own zone patrick roy is screened on everything say what you want about his performance imnsho he cannot stop what he cannot see and montreal s defence does a miserable job of clearing the front of the net last night against washington roy played a great game the first goal came on the most ridiculous goalmouth scramble i ve seen in a long time and he didn t have a hope in hell of stopping the shot the second goal came on a deflection of a shot he only partially saw anyway pathetic defence the third goal was en no wonder he gets pissed off at his defencemen dchhabra stpl ists ca
re vlad s playoff picks in article vzhivov cunews vzhivov alfred carleton ca vladimir zhivov writes wales conference adams division semifinal boston vs buffalo the bruins are playing some excellent hockey and with cam neely back and moog his old self again this should be a cake walk bruins in i m hoping for a fuhr miracle but i agree that boston will likely win the series goaltending is about equal top offensive players are about equal mogilny lafontaine vs oates juneau but buffalo has no answer to neely not to imply that neely is not a top offensive player btw in fact he s one of my favourites even though he s a damn bruin and the rest of the matchup wrt lineup favours boston anyway but i think it will go six quebec vs montreal this one is very tough to call montreal certainly has the experience factor but quebec is more talented imho it ll come down to the goalies i ll go with experience and roy canadiens in agreed here but montreal will be pushed to the limit is it just me or does everything montreal does in the playoffs come down to roy go habs final boston vs montreal will bruin domination continue in this rivalry yes moog has consistently outperformed roy in the playoffs after other stuff bruins in five i can t predict a montreal victory because i ve been watching them play for weeks and imo they severly need some tougher players especially to play in the garden last time they beat the b s but boston had a clear territorial advantage the victory was roy s at the same time i can t bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss so i ll just say i will not be putting money on this series patrick division semifinal pittsburgh vs ny islanders what can i say the pens are flying high and have the most talent in the league agreed ny doesn t have the goaltending to stop the onslaught independent of the trouble they have given pittsburgh this year pens in five which is credit to ny washington vs new jersey capitals in agreed here too but i think it will go at least six jersey has a decent team and washington has done poorly against the division this year pittsburgh vs washington if the caps had bill ranford i might see an upset but don beaupre just doesn t inspire my hopes penguins in i think they will use tabaracci more after beaupre gets shelled i don t think it will go six either maybe five conference final pittsburgh vs boston a replay of last year the penguins are just as good as months ago and the bruins are much improved but penguins in if pittsburgh plays boston imo they win in likely five possibly six they own the bruins if they play montreal i think it will go to seven and once again i won t be putting money on the seventh game i say seven because the habs have played pittsburgh very tough this season campbell conference norris division semifinal chicago vs st louis or minnesota blackhawks in chicago will win but i think in at least six chicago is not that good imo and remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties detroit vs toronto the leafs have had an excellent season but they ve been playing playoff hockey all year the habs under burns were the same way and always wilted in the playoffs red wings in very true the leafs have much to be proud of but they will soon find out why montreal did so lousy in the playoffs toronto might win two or three at mlg though wings in six maybe even seven final chicago vs detroit this will be a war fedorov will win it in ot red wings in it will be a war possibly the most intense playoff series of them all and yes i think detroit will win probert will have to come up big though smythe division semi finals vancouver vs winnipeg canucks in our first disagreement canucks are playing like shit they don t use their size at all which may explain why they get hammered by a team chasing them calgary winnipeg in six calgary vs los angeles this would have been tough to call except for three things the kings don t have a goalie gary roberts will be back the kings shot themselves in the foot by trading a proven winner paul coffey for a proven loser jimmy carson gretzky is just too weary to carry this group flames in this is also tough for me to call because i haven t seen the smythe enough i don t think roberts will be well enough to figure in coffey is a non issue who cares what carson has done before and never underestimate gretzky la in six final vancouver vs calgary flames in if it is these two calgary will not need six games but i think it will be la winnipeg anyway and la in seven because of home ice coference final detroit vs calgary red wings in wow must ve been tough to go against your team but let s see i picked la detroit detroit will win probably in six stanley cup final pittsburgh vs detroit three in a row and official dynasty status for the pens or can the wings complete a dream season well the wings are better in goal not sufficiently so though imho and have better d men however mario and the boys can sure score look for jagr to shine in the playoffs though i sure would love to see probert beat some sense into him the pens are just too much especially since detroit will have a tougher battle to get here penguins in if pittsburgh plays detroit it will go longer than five and i wouldn t bet against the wings they are very strong imo and nobody knows how strong because they ve been underachieving most of the year if forced to choose though i d have to take the penguins a side note vlad last week you said that selanne was a better player than gilmour no way he is a more talented pure goal scorer but aside from the age difference there is no way i would take him over gilmour on my team i m not asking for flames either btw i ve spent more than enough time arguing on behalf of selanne and i still say he s a great player but while he and gilmour are both dangerous offensively give teemu an edge gilmour does it all i know a lot of gilmour bashing goes on esp from flame fans but imo you guys are letting your dislike of gilmour cloud your judgement when it comes to his skill he is easily one of the best all round players in the nhl dchhabra stpl ists ca

re what s so bad about the new playoff format in article bu edu icop csa bu edu antonio pera writes what s so bad about the new playoff format do you really believe teams that finish fourth in their div deserve to be in the playoffs with the new format you have more of a chance to see more teams do you really want to see the bruins against the sabres umpteen times or would you rather see the bruins and the capitals in the secound round of playoffs there is really nothing inherently wrong with it but they tried it just a little over a decade ago and noone showed up for the early rounds in the playoffs whereas soon after they went to the divisional set up arenas were mostly filled in the early rounds the empirical evidence of the last two decades is that more people will show up to see the bruins play the sabre umpteen times than see the bruins play the captials in the first round maybe hockey has increased in popularity sufficiently that this will no longer be the case the experiment is worthwhile with the uneven distribution of the expansion teams but i prefer the divisional playoff gerald
re for sale edmonton oilers in article mcm b w w ersys edmonton ab ca mbevan ersys edmonton ab ca mark bevan writes he was already offered million for them from northlands coliseum but refused the offer i don t think he is going to sale i think he may decide to move the team to the states though where he can draw more revenue from the team pocklington just wanted to wake up the powers that be holding political office in northlands and in the business community that the oilers with their current lease arrangement are in a state where on a yearly basis they will likely have an operating loss based on normal hockey revenues and expenses that he did this was a good thing it is better he complain early and make the city aware of a potential looming crisis before he begins to lose millions and millions of dollars which would truly jeopardize the franchise pocklington s first option is not to sell or to move but to sell a minority share of the team to realize some of the appreciated value of the team and to get a better arena deal either in northlands or via a new building pocklington probably isn t going to get exactly what he wants but ultimately he will probably get enough or will sell to someone who will probably get enough there are a lot of risks in moving a team also one has to remember peter puck s principle it is better to spend other people s money than one s own if at all possible gerald

re barasso the cheap shot master robert angelo pleshar rp andrew cmu edu writes after watching the pengiuns all year and as many other teams as possible i ve really noticed an increase in tom barasso s cheap shots this year and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other goaltenders have a look at ed belfour he also kicked john mclean of course he wasn t called for that belfour kicked gerrard gallant when the wings played the hawks a couple of weeks ago no penalty no review no suspension this was after he attacked bob probert in the previous period he was penalized for that there s no doubt in my mind that barasso is the dirtiest golatender since hextall he s also very good likewise belfour too bad he goes down so much ralph brian down bdown vis toronto edu

the hawks will return to the finals well now that the hawks have won the division the road is a little easier for the playoffs let toronto and detroit beat the hell out of each other while chicago sweeps st louis that just makes it easier in the second round with all the rest they will get and tor det getting none for the conf champ they will have a hard time versus the division but that div will be pretty battered also so the advantage goes to the hawks again then bring pitt and sure the hawks will probably lose but its better to get that far and lose than to not go brian

flyers notes the flyers closed out the season last night with their th straight victory a ot winner over the hartford whalers the ot game winner came from dimitri yushkevich just his th of the season and his first game winner the flyers never led up until that point in the game for the whalers the loss marked an nhl record th ot loss this season roster move gord hynes was called to to play in place of ryan mcgill injuries ryan mcgill injured his hand in a fight and was scratched lines eklund lindros recchi beranek brind amour dineen lomakin butsayev conroy faust acton brown galley bowen yushkevich hawgood carkner hynes dominic roussel game summary i didn t get tv coverage of the game and since it was stormy in these parts i didn t have the best radio coverage either here s the box score followed by a few things i did pick up first period hartford nylander philadelphia recchi lindros brind amour pp penalties verbeek har holding carkner phi roughing houda har interference second period hartford burt cunneyworth kron philadelphia bowen eklund recchi hartford nylander zalapski sanderson penalties galley phi major game misconduct spearing verbeek har major game misconduct

roussel penalties houda har tripping hawgood phi holding overtime philadelphia yushkevich faust penalties none power play philadelphia of hartford of goalies philadelphia roussel shots saves hartford lenarduzzi on the first hartford goal gord hynes misplayed the puck at the flyers blue line and nylander stripped him and took off the recchi goal was a on with lindros the bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie on the second nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in this is the most frustrating part of the flyers defense take the body and if they get one shot and beat you fine don t give them another chance carkner galley and mcgill are all terrible about this i ll bet money at least one of them was the closest flyer to the play that s all i have my radio got bad after that and i was lucky to know who it was that scored much less how from what i heard roussel had a very strong game after the game gene hart asked bobby taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game it was garry galley for his career high point total i m surprised that a former goalie wouldn t look closer at his defensive play tommy soderstrom for his team record tying shutouts in only about a season and mark recchi for his all time high team single season scoring mark but here s the odd part he couldn t decide between lindros and recchi for number if he picks recchi as after he had a hard time choosing between him and lindros doesn t that make lindros what you wanna know my three stars of the season well since you asked eric lindros eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice the difference between the team s record with him and without him is no accident i believe that the team could have been almost as successful without recchi there is no question that this team is significantly better with eric lindros on it and i think that he will deservedly wear the c on his jersey next season tommy soderstrom shutouts was second in the league to only ed belfour and tommy didn t have a chris chelios booo in front of him he also didn t play a complete season due to heart problems sentimental edge here my family has a history of heart problems there s no question in my mind that tommy soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future and if roussel complains again about being number look for him to be traded within years mark recchi again you can t argue with an all time team high single season scoring mark there are an awful lot of teams that didn t have a single player get as many points plus mark is the only flyer to play the entire season not a tough choice honorable mentions rod brind amour topped his single season high point total which he set last year the difference was that he wasn t on the top line this year and didn t get as much playing time then again he didn t get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either dimtri yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman yes he made rookie mistakes but he was usually fast enough to make up for them i have a feeling that with his shot he ll score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone and i suspect that he ll be the teams top defenseman in years to come garry galley was the team s point leader from defensemen again there are some things you just can t argue with and he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game and that was against his wishes under doctors orders but his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution a little more caution and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year brent fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total but consistency became a problem for him a couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members tom misnik a member of the mailing list would like

re div and conf names in apr hubcap clemson edu jwodzia dlite uucp john wodziak writes sorry roger but mr basketbal should what he really means here ie he should have said that he hopes fans in the american southeast can follow the names of the divisions the odds that these people other than those who are displaced notherners who are probably already fans is on the order of the proverbial snowball s in hell i am not at all clear about what you are trying to say here if you asked somone who had never heard of hockey before if la played in the smythe division what do you think that the response would be what if you asked this person if la played in the west division the naming of divisions after long dead entrepreneurs is unnecessary obfuscation i am glad that the names are being changed for another reason the names patrick smythe norris adams and campbell are all the names of so called builders of the game this is the same type of thinking that put stein in the hall of fame this is absolute nonsense the real builders of the game are richard morenz howe conacher orr etc if you are going to name the divisions after people at least name the divisions after people who deserve it yes these people deserve recognigtion as hockey greats but the old division names took into account messers patrick norris smythe and the prince who had alot more to do with the origins of the league than people who came into an already established situation it is much easier to be an element of change hardly the established situation existed prior to smythe et al the stanley cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team could successfully mount the challenge what our dear founders did was formalize the challenge they created a closed league an oligop olistic professional system in the interests of making money wheth er or not that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly debatable we are however stuck with their invention and that de bate is academic the point to be made however is that people played hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey long before smythe and his pals showed up or a standout in an existing situation than it is to be someone who creates a new situation if you want to honor players like bobby orr than i m sure you can find a reason to name a torphy after him such as best offensive defenseman what s wrong with best defenceman period was there ever a better defenceman was there ever a better player and if you think that bruce norris contribution was somehow more significant than bobby orr s then in the interests of education why don t you take a poll and find out how many people know who norris was but you don t have to do you no i can t for the reasons i gave above i m in the same boat as jason and i grew up with the current divisonal names and learned them when i was about years old and who played in what division if a year old american can learn this why would it be hard for an occasional fan to pick up on who plays in what division so you don t feel that you should have to make the effort to remember that vancouver plays in the west division or pacific or whatever other intuitively understandable moniker is chosen oh now i see your point your intention has been to alert us to the erosion of purity i ll bet you like hockey because it s for the most part played by whites of european extraction probably not in my case i m sure of this what you said would be like me saying that all maple leafs fans are as biased closed minded ignorant and of course you neatly deleted jason s jingoistic rant about the game losing its canadianization quoting me out of context does more to erode your credibility than it does mine my position is clearly progressive and is anything but biased closed minded ig norant arrogant i will grant you arrogant and moronic as you just because someone a doesn t like what mr basketball is doing b voices their opinion and c likes the senerio of you going to antartica does not mean that you have the right to insult them nice try john but for a flame to be truly effective you have to display at least enough intelligence to earn your target s respect cordially as always rm roger maynard maynard ramsey cs laurentian ca

re truly a sad day for hockey a fine year history came to a close tonight as the minnesota north stars or norm s stars whichever you prefer lost to the red wings by a score of the stars goals were scored by mike mcphee and ulf dahlen who netted two including the final one in franchise history with less than a minute to play yes it s a shame that the nhl lost a fine team in one of the best hockey markets in the country being a north stars fan it is sad to see all of the tradition of the last years get thrown into oblivion at the hands of a truly crappy owner hopefully the nhl will install an expansion franchise in the twin cities within the next five years even if this is the case a lot has been lost in the north stars move kea

european expansion and our f cked system everyone keeps talking about european expansion by thinking wishful thoughts but being totally off the ball the league format we use here is incompatible with that in europe for those that don t know the best teams from lower divisions get promoted and the worst get demoted would european fans put up with our if you ve paid you can play attitude how long would they support teams that are run on ranger based corporate thinking i use the term lightly we don t need a good product because these duffuses in nyc would fill the arena for ottawa s record every year haha sorry had ta say it if hockey and other pro sports had a similar system to europe maybe teams like the rangers would be forced to compete or get demoted the fourth division we d have many more teams centres that aren t as big like halifax or adirondack ok so halifax isn t a good example would eventually get promoted and every team would be somewhat competetive within its own division unlike ottawa sj edmonton etc fans would eventually get rewarded for their loyalty or penalized for their neglect and the league would be more interesting and dynamic every year because of the influx of newly promoted teams and the halifax citadels win the stanley cup i can dream can t i look at british or any european soccer as an example they never have fan problems just someone who thinks our system really sucks barfly feel free to flame me my account ends today hahahaha

re flyers re this year s biggest and worst opinion in article apr cbnewsm cb att com jmd cbnewsm cb att com joseph m dakes writes in article apr cbnewsh cb att com seth cbnewsh cb att com peter r clark jr writes so roussel was giving up almost another goal a game while facing a proportional number of shots for the number of minutes he played and while i have t actually checked i believe that he faced a lower quality of opponent make that less than half a goal a game the lower quality of opponet argument is immaterial as neither roussel nor soderstrom had any say in the matter that was dineen s decision so in other words if roussel shuts out the sharks and soderstrom shuts out the penguins that s immaterial because it was the coaches decision come on joe think about what you re saying who they played is very significant why they played them is what s irrelevent a low gaa against good teams is better than a low gaa against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders a low gaa is better then a higher gaa a low gaa against good teams is much much better than a higher gaa against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders the fact of the matter is that despite last nights shutout he doesn t have what it takes last night was due to an inept ranger team much more than roussel s skill a on and they don t get a shot away a on none and one guy just passes and stops the other guy shoots into roussel s pad c mon pete so the rangers were inept a shutout is a shutout during both of soderstrom s masterpieces against toronto mike emerich was quoted as saying he didn t think the leafs had much offensive firepower past their first line does that make soderstrom s shutouts less impressive because of toronto s lack of offense yes it does absolutely in the context of comparing two goaltenders of course at the end of the season points is points no matter how you get them and on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts but if you re a coach deciding between two goalies or a gm looking to make a trade you have got to look deeper than the stat sheets i didn t see the second toronto game but the first one was a defensive masterpiece there was nothing in that game to judge tommy soderstrom on because he wasn t tested the same for roussel in the ranger game two real scoring chances one he made a great play the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player if you were judging roussel on that game alone you have very little to go by but if you were to look at the tie against the habs you saw a goalie stand on his head to get that shutout that was a goalie in action roussel doesn t have a game like that in him well if you look back to november when roussel was the goalie soderstrom was being treated for his heart ailment the flyers finished november at and were overall and there s no way of knowing where the flyers would have finished if soderstom wasn t wearing the oragne n black i m glad we don t have to find out anytime soon either because he is one hell of a player i would take him over roussel right now but i still think dom has what it takes to be the guy he outperformed hextall enough during the season to make flyers management think that way too don t be so sure of that flyers management never says bad thing about roussel but they don t say too much on the good side either i ve seen at least two interviews where every time farwell was asked how happy he was to have two good goaltenders it was tommy this tommy that and oh yeah dom has played well too by the way what was the final card on monday night team picture by any chance flyers in the nhl hall of fame kinda dull really they handed out a team picture to everybody who walked in from pizza hut but it was the same picture they sold in the programs in mid season had names like benning kasper and how did the flyers choose the fans who received the shirts off our backs winning recchi s jersey after breaking the club s single season point record would have been nice but knowing your luck you would have won roussel s mostly random seat locations some were given out by having certain autographs on the team photos i don t like that method since i ve seen guards help out people get things like lindros pictures surely if they got their hands on an autographed picture they d hold em for their buddies pete clark

re plus minus stat in article ramsey cs laurentian ca maynard ramsey cs laurentian ca roger maynard writes certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team and that is simply because there are not enough solid two way players to go around who would you rather have as your checking centre doug gilmour or doug jarvis for that matter i would take either gretzky or mario as my checking centres do you think gretzky could cover bob gainey gretzky lemieux gilmour etc do not play the role of checking centreman they play an offensive role as opposed to a defensive one if they were used as defensive centres it would be a waste of their offensive abilities when you compare gretzky et al to jarvis gainey etc you are comparing apples and oranges it is like me telling you that felix potvin isn t very good because a team would be better if the had lemieux instead of him sure lemieux is a better player but he is a different type of player for a team to be successful they need to have all types of players this includes defensive forwards when compared with other defensive forwards bob gainey is the greatest defensive forward ever he is the player who s talents best suited being a defensive forward who completely dominated the game when he played maybe if a more talented player such as gretzky had decided to waste his offensive talents and play defensively he could have been a better defensive forward but he wasn t bob gainey is the best defensive forward that has ever played hockey gregmeister

date thu apr gmt in ld b w w sms business uwo ca j david sms business uwo ca james david writes it was bryan trottier not denis potvin it was a vicious boarding from behind trottier was given a major perhaps it was trottier it happened behind the habs goal if i recall gainey simply didn t have his head up as he was picking up the puck but roger what the hell does this have to do with gainey s skill as a hockey player if probert smashes gilmour s head into the boards next week will that diminish your assessment of gilmour s skills if gilmour was taken completely by surprise as gainey was then yeah i would have to say that doug wasn t playing technically smart hockey in any case to claim as greg did that gainey never made a technical mistake is absolutely ludicrous later on in your posting you make reference to putting words into other people s mouths i would suggest that your last paragraph can only be interpreted in one way namely that i along with greg claim that gainey never made a technical mistake if you actually read what i ve written you will find that i make no such claim soooo if logic serves me well you re contradicting yourself gainey was a plugger and when the press runs out of things to say about the stars on dynasties they start to hype the pluggers grant fuhr essa tikkannen butch goring bob nystrom bob gainey doug jarvis derek sanderson wayne cashman bob baun bob pulford ralph backstrom henri richard dick duff and so on i would take fuhr and sanderson off of the latter good for you you d only be displaying your ignorance of course but to each his own roger i m not sure here but i think ignorance is really a function of a lack of knowledge and not formulating an opinion but hey if you need to take a cheap shot then by all means go ahead that s if it makes you feel better i think gainey would be honoured to know that you ve included him i think gainey should feel honoured to know that he is remembered at all my word such vehemence against poor ol bob gainey why does he bother you so much he was an effective player for his style of play on this list i also think you have a relatively naive view about what wins a hockey game pluggers are an integral part of certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team and that is simply because there are not enough solid two way players to go around who would you rather have as your checking centre doug gilmour or doug jarvis for that matter i would take either gretzky or mario as my checking centres do you think gretzky could cover bob gainey i m really sorry roger but you have lost me completely here why don t you ask me if i would rather have jesus christ himself in nets now if you were to compare say for example bob gainey with guy carbonneau you would have a balanced comparison any team the selke is designed to acknowledge their contribution i think that most people understand that it s not the nobel prize so settle down you re wrong again the selke is awarded to the forward that does the best job defensively and this may or may not be the best plugger if gilmour does the best defensive job in the league i don t see why he should be out of the running simply because he also contributes offen sively i m wrong again hmmm let s see where was i wrong in the first place i m only guessing here rog but i have a feeling that you ve setup a you re wrong again macro key on your machine i agree that my use of the word plugger is simplistic but i think you know what i m getting at i would also like to point out that gilmour s potential as a selke winner was never part of the debate are you asking me for an opinion if so i think there are far too many other deserving players to include gilmour among the candidates settle down if you think that i have likened the selke to the nobel prize then i suggest that you had best settle down and if you are going to try to put words in my mouth let me suggest that you settle down before you bother following up on my postings i would suggest that your comment and when the press runs out of things to say about the stars on dynasties they start to hype the pluggers grant fuhr essa tikkannen butch goring bob nystrom bob gainey doug jarvis derek sanderson wayne cashman bob baun bob pulford ralph backstrom henri richard dick duff and so on demonstrates a blanket disregard for these individuals as contributors to the game so

plus minus stat post of newsgroups rec sport hockey from maynard ramsey cs laurentian ca roger maynard subject re plus minus stat organization dept of computer science laurentian university sudbury on date fri apr gmt discussion deleted good for you you d only be displaying your ignorance of course but to each his own roger i m not sure here but i think ignorance is really a function of a lack of knowledge and not formulating an opinion but hey if you need to take a cheap shot then by all means go ahead that s if it makes you feel better to knowledgeable observers of the game my meaning is obvious your hockey education is not my responsibility my hockey education what the f are you talking about i m not even going to try to refute this absolutely insane statement my word such vehemence against poor ol bob gainey why does he bother you so much he was an effective player for his style of play he was just another player to laud him as anything more i find bothersome i hated the habs i hated lafleur until i realized that he was likely the most aesthetically pleasing player to ever skate in my lifetime why would anyone talk about gainey i hate the habs you sound like a year old this statement is just further exemplifies your total inability to argue objectively about hockey don t give me this crap about cogent arguments i ve yet to read something of yours that is cogent you consistently argue with emotion huge sweeping statements frankly you have a very unconvincing style i m not defending bob gainey frankly i don t care for him all that much but your dismissal of him as something less than an effective hockey player is tiresome it has no basis in anything how many calders did he win i think it was four go ahead and refresh my memory what about the conn smythe was that a fluke yeah not the makings of a hockey superstar i know but try to have a reason any reason to shoot him down go around who would you rather have as your checking centre doug gilmour or doug jarvis for that matter i would take either gretzky or mario as my checking centres do you think gretzky could cover bob gainey i m really sorry roger but you have lost me completely here why don t you ask me if i would rather have jesus christ himself in nets did he play hockey at a high level was he any good if not why would you bother to bring jc up i am talking about hockey players here if you can t follow the conversation don t follow up as i said previously it is not my responsibility to educate you hey cowboy you re the expert who introduced the idiotic comparison of gainey with gretzky and lemieux you figure it out now if you were to compare say for example bob gainey with guy carbonneau you would have a balanced comparison sure two journeymen big deal neither one of them is worth discussing how many individual awards between them eight i don t remember once again please feel free to refresh my memory and try to be as sarcastic as possible about my hockey education i m wrong again hmmm let s see where was i wrong in the i would take fuhr and sanderson off of the latter oh my god did i say that roger what s your point fuhr is a goaltender goaltender s don t plug in his prime he was one of the best sanderson was a scrapper if you stick him on you may as well include half the flyers team of the same era first place i m only guessing here rog but i have a feeling that you ve setup a you re wrong again macro key on your machine that is an excellent idea and if i decide to waste any more time responding to any of your or greg s postings then i will be sure to implement that very macro oh roger you shouldn t really i don t deserve this you are far too accomodating already i would suggest that your comment and when the press runs out of things to say about the stars on dynasties they start to hype the pluggers grant fuhr essa tikkannen butch goring bob nystrom bob gainey doug jarvis derek sanderson wayne cashman bob baun bob pulford ralph backstrom henri richard dick duff and so on demonstrates a blanket disregard for these individuals as contributors to the game so yes settle down nobody has claimed that they are hockey gods tarasov claimed that gainey was a hockey god and greg ate it up and that is what this thread is all about if you didn t know that then why are you responding you seem to have allowed all of these other players fall into your sweeping vacuous statement that s why if you want to debate gainey go ahead but why bring up everybody else how does it support your argument do you have an argument or do you just like to throw around a few names hoping to impress us and as for blanket disregard for these individuals i can remember leaf teams purely populated by such individuals winning four stanley cups teams no one ran around telling us that george armstrong was the best hockey player in the world great i couldn t agree more the flyers won two cups for the same reasons deservedly so so what i don t get it are you angry that the leafs didn t get more recognition you seem to think these pluggers are hyped i don t agree plain and simple if you re last statement is some sort of compromise fair enough you might consider developing your own style after all imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and i am quite sure that flattery is not your intention c mon it has a nice ring to it and admit it you had a good laugh right i had to get to the end of your posting before i realized you were a complete joke not a pleasant bone in your body eh rog why are you so unhappy not getting invited to enough parties what in the future if you are going to respond to my postings i would appreciate it if you could present a cogent argument supported by facts gleaned from a version of reality that most of the rest of us would recognize roger why are you under the impression that responding to your posts is some great honour you really should stop it sounds a little bit pathetic frankly it s about as honourable as

sharks review part goaltenders as the sharks season came to a close tonight i will start a series of posts trying to revisit the players the trades the moves etc that went through for the sharks for the past season if you are uninterested since i will have the words sharks review in the subject heading in these postings you can kill them i will first try to evaluate how the players did these ratings of course are subject to my own biases but i hope that i can try to be as objective as possible i will evalute players who finished the season with the sharks and or did not play for another nhl team this season thus then let s go to the goaltenders brian hayward season th acquired from minnesota in dispersal draft grade p d it is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end a career that featured sharing three jennings trophies with patrick roy in and it would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing grade and skip the letter grading but he had simply been awful on ice this year save for a bright spot or two and even if he had been healthy he would not be any more than the rd string goalie but hayward was a classy individual who also figured in on the sharks first ever victory the rd game of the season last year against the calgary flames as he retires the fans will remember what a good guy he was jeff hackett season rd acquired from n y islanders in expansion draft grade c hackett after deservedly winning the team mvp honors last season simply wasted the year other than a few good spots saves against los angeles almost shutout against tampa bay etc hackett finishing with save percentage and a gaa watched his status go from the team s goalie to bench decoration at the end of the season he was expected early to carry the team along instead he apparently became frustrated but the an early injury that forced him to miss games may have been a contributing factor but upon return he simply wasn t up to the task he may not return next year wade flaherty season st still eligible as rookie acquired signed as undrafted free agent grade i a it is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone thus the incomplete grade but yet in the one start that he did get against the calgary flames flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods he started the season poorly in kansas city but finished strong prompting the blades owner ron parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the ihl mvp honors the upcoming ihl playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he tries to make it into the nhl last year he was a capable backup for arturs irbe in the throughout the season and in the turner cup playoffs picking up all star honors along with irbe now it s time for him to show that he can share the job with irbe next year because with prospects dan ryder trevor robins and scott cashman coming along if he doesn t make it next year he may not ever arturs irbe season st acquired from minnesota in dispersal draft grade b i may yet be overly critical of irbe in a year that he clearly established that he s a bona fide nhl goaltender perhaps a bona fide goaltender he has provided most of the little highlight footage that the sharks team had getting the team s first ever shut out against the los angeles kings on december he has been fearless in and out of the net aggressively playing the puck and making passes reminding people of a young ron hextall except of course the goonism yet he still needs to develop more consistency which is hard to do with such a bad defense in front of him but if the sharks are to challenge for a playoff spot next season irbe s the key as he demonstrated in being named as a star of the game times in starts go calgary flames al macinnis for norris gary roberts for hart and smythe go edmonton oilers go for playoffs next year stay in edmonton nelson lu claudius leland stanford edu rec sport hockey contact for the san jose sharks

finland sweden vs nhl teams was helsinki stockholm nhl expansion in tervio katk helsinki fi tervio katk helsinki fi writes now what if the two teams were merged this has been proposed in tampere with ilves lynx and tappara axe the fans wouldn t take it they rather see their teams out of the playoffs most of the time or even relegated than merged it s not that difficult to understand it s just like here in helsinki you grow up being either a jokerit or hifk fan the other team is the last team in the world you would support i m not talking about hate but about extremely deeply rooted rivalry deeply rooted rivalry ahem jokerit have been around since and joined the top flight only in the early s helsingfors ifk have been around since but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the s so i think you re exagerating here however it s been proved that both fan groups can cheer the same team that s the finnish national team maybe that s how you could set up a huge franchise in finland no one has ever said that the team must be called after one city or play all its games on one arena just one team finland and team sweden in the nhl just wouldn t make any sense we have way more talent than th of the total of north american talent after a couple of seasons you would never see the cup going anywhere outside the nordic presuming that our teams would have the advantage in drafting local talent as prooposed that s a rather bold claim in the light of how successful the canadian american olympic teams have been and they ve had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice the olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team canada had eric lindros sean burke joe juneau and chris kontos another four or five have been deep subs in the nhl as for the yanks keith tkachuk scott lachance bret hedican shawn mceachern steve heintze ted donato joe sacco and bill guerin have been rd th line players in the nhl while robb stauber has done well for the kings in goal nothing more in fact i m sure that an all star team assembled from the best finnish league teams would do no better in the nhl than hartford or tampa bay currently are doing but what happens if all top class finnish swedish players gradually end up with helsinki stockholm as the north american based ones gradually retire and no canadian american team is allowed to draft new players from scandinavia here is what the hockey news scouts think of our nhl based players superstar star nhl regular nhl regular role player finland d jyrki lumme d teppo numminen d

there with any five man unit pittsburgh co have but i have my doubts about the home based finnish players the national team did well in the canada cup and world championships largely due to the efforts of markus ketterer the goalie or the players listed above and luck there s presumably a lot of decent players in finland that wouldn t be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players however my guess would be that the finnish canada cup team would be a team in the nhl sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in north america their points total players is seven more than ottawa s top players combined if we estimate there are six more nhl regulars back home in sweden an all swedish team would assemble about skill points deducting some points from pittsburgh ny rangers and other teams that rely on swedish players the swedish team would finish in sixth place about as high as boston vancouver calgary and montreal on paper so the dynasty talk isn t completely unfounded here an all finnish all swedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time won t have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language and presumably play the wide open european variant of hockey rather than have to learn the north american checking game however if free agency becomes a factor the top scandinavian players still might end up playing for large market teams after a couple of years the same way edmonton s dynasty crumbled in the late s some fringe players likely will be drafted by other nhl teams as having an exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all i d settle for a compromise prohibit all european teams from signing a north american during the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players after this the amateur draft should be open to anyone j o o j o o j o k e r i t finland over czech in the final b r u i n p o w e r bruins over blackhawks in marcu

re div and conf names in apr newshub ists ca dchhabra stpl ists ca deepak chhabra writes however that aside the real question is whether you like the idea of changing the names based on the reasons given for it making it easier for the casual fan or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names based on individuals who do deserve the honour imo the latter is a nice and unique touch that differs from other sports in addition i do not think that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of people that are interested in hockey so it s a pointless exercise anyway there are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the fans i feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties more than names honouring personages and of course they would not appear nearly as confusing to one approaching the sport for the first time another thing that bothers me is the points system percentages as used in the other major sports are clearly more informative when i look at the nhl standings the first thing i have to do is make a quick calculation to account for games in hand which is almost always the case some will object to percentages claiming perhaps that it is an americanization of the sport but i feel that using percentages is more informative and whether it is american or not is irrelevant if the current names are inappropriate then that is a separate issue not central to the original article something to consider additionally is whether or not players like orr who contributed to the glory of the sport would have been able to do so without an organized professional league to play in in this case honouring builders of the league as opposed to builders of the sport becomes a chicken and egg type question although it was the chicken even if orr couldn t have contributed without the likes of norris you would have to agree that norris couldn t have contributed without the likes of orr and taking a poll of most fans would quickly tell you who the fans feel made the more meaningful contribution exactly true naming divisions and trophies after smythe and the bunch is the same kind of nepotism that put stein in the hall of fame i have always thought that this was nonsense dunno if the stein comparison is justifiable since it doesn t look as though his unanimous acceptance to the hall will hold up it doesn t look as if the division names are going to hold up either does it cordially as always maynard ramsey cs laurentian ca so many morons rm and so little time

sharks review part left wings apparently part defensemen numbered through was lost when i posted it to make things worse i lost my own copy i have asked on the sharks mailing list on which it did get out to see if someone can mail me a copy back if someone responds i will repost it when i get it otherwise i will re write it in a day or two and post it sorry about that larry depalma season rd acquired free agent from minnesota grade i c d no netter fan watching the sharks including me knows where depalma was at the end of the season the sharks appeared to still have his rights but he wasn t in san jose he wasn t in kansas city and his name hasn t appeared on the waiver wire and that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part for depalma after being called up october against the tampa bay lightning depalma had an excellent week scoring points in games while playing good defense unfortunately the year old depalma then disappeared the rest of the way getting just more points in more games and generally looked lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice he then was sent down to kansas city walked out from there and was suspended and later reinstated when it was revealed that he was injured he then promptly disappeared from the watching eyes of shark bytes as the mailing list is now known to sharks officials faithful and neither the sharks nor we miss him johan garpenlov season rd acquired trade with detroit for d bob mcgill and th round pick in entry draft from vancouver grade a a after an early slump garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest of the way finishing with points in games second highest total on the team as he clicked well with team mvp kelly kisio and right wing rob gaudreau kisio got most of the credit but garpenlov finishing second in the mvp voting clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills as he was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders getting a club high power play goals contrary to his previous rep garpenlov also showed that despite his small size lbs he was willing to throw himself around when necessary albeit not very successful yet he also still needs to work on his defense although he improved tremendously throughout the season and was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season he will be a major key to the offense next year david bruce season th acquired from st louis in expansion draft grade i after a banner when he led the team in power play goals and was third in total scoring points in games bruce was bothered virtually all of this season with a groin injury which kept him out of the lineup for all by games this season of course it is difficult to speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by the injury but the year old bruce was effective with a man up or a man short in the sharks first season and was expected to be a strong offensive leader this season as well the injury appears serious which is a shame because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now instead his future with the sharks next season appears clouded mark pederson season rd acquired trade with philadelphia for c lw dave snuggerud grade i b it is difficult for me to understand the flyers decision to unload pederson after a very good offensive season last season points in games but after riding the pine early in the season pederson was summarily sent to the sharks in exchange of the defensive minded snuggerud and he finished with games combined with the flyers and the sharks he was also limited by injuries this season and this limited his production points but when healthy pederson appears impressive with a good scoring touch good size and the willingness to throw it around although he s not considered a physical forward and good speed he also does not appear to be a liability on defense but the sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how much exactly pederson can do john carter season th acquired free agent from boston grade i b b carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team and the hard work worked wonders as at times he looked great on ice however although he did look great at times the fact that he received just points in games for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can do and the sharks confirmed that by sending him to kansas city with about games left in the season carter who will turn on may always hussled but as a result was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive zone while forechecking but he was generally a credit on the defensive end but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity and he did not impress offensively although he was one of the best sharks at drawing penalties he is very unlikely to be back next season jean francois quintin season st acquired from minnesota in dispersal draft grade i b b i don t understand why the sharks didn t let quintin play any more than the games he played this season he was generally hard working and creating opportunities offensively and appeared at age ready for regular nhl duty at least for a team like the sharks finishing with points in those games while not being a defensive liability shoulder injury in training camp before the season limited quintin the team s leading scorer in exhibition games despite sitting out the final two to just games with the sharks and the blades that season but he looked impressive he should be a solid contender for regular duty next season mark beaufait season st acquired nd round pick in supplemental draft grade i after a all star season at kansas city beaufait got a cup of coffey with the sharks late in the season when the blades knocked down a playoff spot and the sharks decimated with injuries playing games and scoring a goal for his only nhl point thus far despite small size lbs beaufait was not shy to throw himself around when necessary and looked pretty good at times although it s too early to judge him based on nhl games in which he played mostly left wing away from his center position at northern michigan and kansas city jaroslav otevrel season st acquired th round pick in entry draft grade i like beaufait otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was up for his cup of tea games midway through the season he was generally very much of a defensive liability and did not show much offensively either although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those games he may need another season to work on his defense but once his defense is acceptable he should be ready michel picard season st acquired trade with hartford for lw yvon corriveau grade i b c the year old picard although he perennially tore up the minors seems to be close to being out of chances for some reason after being acquired by the sharks but failing to impress the management in games scoring goals for his only points and he spent most of the rest of the way in kansas city he was not particularly strong defensively and despite his offensive brilliance in the minors he has failed thus far to score in the nhl although he has been given limited opportunities he may be the sharks bait in the expansion draft dody wood season st acquired rd round pick in entry draft grade i d d although perhaps i shouldn t give a grade at all i have been accused of knocking on wood too much then it is probably no surprise to you that i am thoroughly unimpressed by wood thus far although games is a small example he was generally a nonfactor on offense was not particularly good defensively and took too many silly penalties losing many fights in the process and gathering penalty minutes in those games projecting to to in an game season he s not ready and needs at least another season at kc where he can work on his fighting skills if nothing else his relatively small size lbs does not give much possibility that he can survive at this stage as an enforcer go calgary flames al macinnis for norris gary roberts for hart and smythe go edmonton oilers go for playoffs next year stay in

sharks review part defensemen i finally got it back with great thanks to mark spiegel for saving and sending it rob zettler season th acquired from minnesota in dispersal draft grade c c zettler gave the sharks every bit he s got this year unfortunately this still wasn t enough to make him any more than a marginal nhler if that he works hard for sure but is no better than average on defense and is prone to costly penalties and defensive lapses at times while being basically an offensive zero goal and assists in games he would be hardpressed to make the team next year david williams season nd acquired free agent from new jersey grade c c imo williams was the most valuable defenseman for the sharks in playing a combination of good offense goals and assists in games and good defense but he playing the first part of this season in kansas city was good neither offensively nor defensively this year it then appears that was a fluke although he improved towards the end of the season he was prone to being out of position defensively and did not demonstrate the playmaking skills that made him the team s leading scorer among defensemen last year he would also be hardpressed to make the team next year jayson more season nd acquired from montreal in expansion draft grade b after being touted as the team s top defensive prospects in training camp before more had a rather disappointing as he was not particularly good defensively and had just points in games he then proceeded to improve his game massively this season becoming the team s most reliable defenseman whom the team can count on night in and night out to play steady defense and providing occasional but only occasional offensive flash offensively he was even more disappointing than last year points in games but his defense improved tremendously he is probably best as the defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman neil wilkinson season th acquired from minnesota in dispersal draft grade b wilkinson was probably the team s top defensive defenseman in however partially because of injuries he was not the same this year as he missed games total due to nagging knee and back injuries and seemed to be slowed even when playing he then had often to be saved by his defensive partners that is if they are there at all but he also had some solid games and if he can be complete healthy he can still be a force sandis ozolinsh season st acquired nd round pick in entry draft grade i a at the time of his injury december against the philadelphia flyers ozolinsh was well on track to be imo the team s mvp a serious knee injury in that game though forced him to miss the rest of the season games but he still finished as the team s top scorer among defensemen points which of course tells more about the lack of offense the sharks had from their defensemen but it also tells of ozolinsh s abilities at the time he was playing very good defense along with excellent offense he was still susceptible to so called rookie mistakes but was probably the defenseman who made the least of them on the team rookie or veteran if he can come back from his injuries he is ready to be a star doug zmolek season st acquired from minnesota in dispersal draft grade b zmolek had basically a solid and durable year being one of the only two sharks to play in all games of the season he was solid on defense but after being billed as an offensive defenseman he didn t show it points he was also prone to penalties and his penalty minutes was second on the team however that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough physical opponents and he was at his best when playing physically but to become a fixture in this league he needs to improve both offensively and defensively and cut down on the number of power plays he gives to opponents go calgary flames al macinnis for norris gary roberts for hart and smythe go edmonton oilers go for playoffs next year stay in edmonton nelson lu claudius leland stanford edu rec sport hockey contact for the san jose sharks

following to national desk contact white house office of the press secretary washington april following is a transcript of remarks by president clinton to the university of maine black bears ncaa division i hockey champions the rose garden a m edt the president good morning ladies and gentlemen it s an honor for me to welcome the university of maine black bears the winner of the ncaa division i hockey national championship to the rose garden and the white house i understand from senator mitchell that this is the first team from the university of maine every to win a national championship and we re glad to have them here i m inspired not only by how the team pulled together to win the championship but how the entire state pulled together to cheer them onto victory coming from a state that is also relatively small in size but also filled with pride and tradition and community i can understand how the people of maine must feel about the black bears in our state people are still talking about the time we won the orange bowl over the number one ranked football team and that was back in i m sure that years from now the people of maine will as proud of this team as they are today you know in my state football is a slightly more popular sport than hockey we don t have a lot of ice laughter but after spending three months getting banged around in this town i can understand a little more about hockey than i did before i came here hockey is a tough game it s a hard hitting sport it does have one virtue though there s a penalty for delay of game i wish we had that rule in the senate laughter in government as in hockey leadership is important in the united states senate our team has a great captain the majority leader and the senior senator from maine george mitchell junior senator cohen looks so young i can t imagine laughter i m actually bitter about senator cohen because he looks so much younger than me on your hockey team the captain jim montgomery has done a great job he scored the winning goal late in the championship game leading you to a come from behind victory something else i know a little bit about sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams and in communities i share the pride that senator mitchell and senator cohen and congressman andrews and all the people of maine must feel for the black bears who have shown us all how to play as a team how to bring out the best in one another and how to come from behind i think it s important as i ask young people from around america who have achieved outstanding things in working together to come here to the white house to be recognized and appreciated by their country to remember that those kinds of values and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all of our lives we now have another role model and i m glad to have them here today applause the president is presented with team jersey applause the president that s great i love it it s beautiful applause the president is presented with an autographed stick the president thank you that s great applause q mr president did you authorize the move on waco this morning sir the president i was aware of it i think the attorney general made the decision and i think i should refer all questions to her and to the fbi q did you have any instructions for her as to how it should be executed the president no they made the tactical decisions that was their judgment the fbi q is this a raid the president and i will i want to refer you to talk to the attorney general and the fbi i knew it was going to be done but the decisions were entirely theirs all the tactical decisions q what did you and senator mitchell talk about this morning q any chance for that stimulus package the president senator mitchell ought to pay my quarter laughter i was in there laughter senator mitchell you have to pay that quarter the president i was ready laughter senator mitchell he s worth a quarter any day q any chance for your bill sir the president we talked about what was going to happen this week in the senate and about what other meetings we re going to have for the rest of the week we only had about five minutes to talk and we agreed we d get back together later around noon and talk some more q senator dole said over the weekend that your compromise is no compromise the president well i know he did but look senator dole and a lot of the other republicans now in the senate voted for the same kind of thing for ronald reagan in and our research indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of emergency spending measures totalling over billion when reagan and bush were president in those administrations and many of those purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the american people back to work i don t want to go back and revisit every one but you can do it you can look at the research there so this position they re taking is not credible we have a very tough five year deficit reduction plan all these costs are covered during that time and then some and the very people that are saying this has all got to be paid for don t have much of a history on which to base their position they ve got years of vote for stimulus measures of this kind that had very little to with putting the american people back to work so i think we ve got a chance to work it out and i m hopeful we ll see what happens today and tomorrow i m feeling pretty good about it the press thank you end a m edt canada remote systems toronto ontario

leafs versus wings how long can the leafs play short handed and still be expected to score they did some fine penely killing in the first men down for a couple of minutes at one point but they just couldn t keep it up they spent virtually the entire game either short handed or just coming off a penelty as soon as they d get re grouped they re penalized again sheesh like gilmour said after the st you can t go calling every little push an shove in a game like that and if you re going to you have to do it for both teams pearson one of my four favorite leafs played like a bonehead i saw him personally screw up at least good scoring opportunities and then he got that bonehead minute major high sticking penalty cullen has gotten stronger since his return from injury a hand full of games ago and he played a good game if the other players on his line can smarten up that line should do okay clark s got to get tough he s got to intimidate and go for the net send clark up the left wing over the blue line a couple times his patented wrist shot will put some numbers on the board and pearson heck maybe he should be benched i hate to repeat grapes but where the heck was foligno zezel can t do all the checking himself and get macllwain on the move we need some speed out there keep potvin in net he did okay considering although like i said a couple weeks ago potvin messed up in a couple games in the ahl playoffs last year he can easily do it again my prediction last week was toronto in that the games det wins will be blow outs and the game tor wins will be close i still stand by that don t fret leafs fans in order to win in the other team has to win burns is going to make some magic he ll mix up some lines match the wings line per line he ll have his team checking hard and he ll never let them get out numbered in their own end the leafs will win wednesday night and will take or their home games probably the first one stephen leaf legge slegge kean ucs mun ca

re wings will win gballent hudson uvic ca greg ballentine writes all of this is fine i never said that murray was a bad gm i merely said that he isn t the best gm in hockey or even a contender for that honor if murray is as great as you claim the wings would have won the stanley cup by now probably more than once if he was as great a gm as you claim i think you missed one of my points there it takes more than a great gm to win a stanley cup even once some of the guys on the list you gave earlier never won one i agree that you and i could probably argue back and forth for days to no avail about who is the best gm in hockey that is a matter of opinion and who is to say my opinion is any better than yours or yours than mine but the point of my original original post if not well stated was that murray has the gm abilities but not the coaching abilities which leads to below and he was as poor a coach as you claim he would have been intelligent enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success i think at this point there s a personal emotional element involved here which transcends murray s logical thought as outsiders it s fine for us to say he should hire a different coach in fact he has talked about doing so in the past but the press here in detroit at least has so built up this business about murray never getting past the second round of the playoffs as a coach that i think he has taken it upon himself to prove to the world that he is capable of coaching a team past the second round he needs to as the papers say get that monkey off his back so it becomes a matter not of intelligence but of pride is it foolish to let pride stand in the way of sound logic perhaps but we re all a little that way from time to time i think eventually he ll step down from behind the bench and concentrate on his gm duties and the team will improve as a result i think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent on gm work in that sense once he steps down as coach we ll see how good of a gm he really is but murray is an average unspectacular nhl coach and a pretty good gm so none of this is true anyway i may not agree with everything you ve said but it s been fun discussing it with you gregmeister randy

minnesota scene to those who are wondering what is happening in minnesota from what i have seen in the local news tv and newspaper various people in the area are trying to get a new hockey team a columnist for the st paul pioneer press wrote an article giving the inside scoop on the issue there are three local sites competing for a team and three possible candiates to move to the twin cities first the sites target center civic center st paul and yes even the met center the columnist was pretty confident that minnesota will get a team and that the target center will ultimately win out he argued however that the competition from the other two sites will delay the process considerably without the inter site competition the columnist sorry i can t remember his name believes that minnesota would have a team by the season also because of the situation with the timberwolves things will be delayed until unless the city of minneapolis takes over the target center however they are unlikely to do so until the met center is destroyed because the city will lose money if there is competition from the met for conventions and short term events even with hockey at target to add to this mess a study to months is going to be conducted on the future viability of the met center which obviously delays the process even further i hope that the study is cancelled which will have the effect of knocking the met center out of the running and perhaps encouraging minneapolis to take over the target center sooner the city would be be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the met which may happen regarding possible candidates the three teams are hartford tampa bay and new jersey i would prefer the devils minnesota ice demons although the lightning may have potential although it hasn t been announced yet it looks like neutral site games will be played at the target center next year apparently the devils are interested in playing in as many of those six games as possible and i wouldn t be surprised to see hartford and tampa show up there either so minnesota may end up getting another team but it may take a few years go sabres robert andolina former buffalonian living in minneapolis randolin polisci umn edu
re aargh great hockey coverage devils robbie po rap psuvm psu edu writes gld cunixb cc columbia edu gary l dare says i mean that the original poster was looking for a devils victory on the tape delay and it didn t happen in game i was the original poster and it was just a complaint about the coverage meaningless yankee game before playoff devils game oh i apologize then i misinterpreted you no problem no offence taken of all the teams in the patrick i least dislike the devils it is sad just as a lover of the sport that this team can be in the metro new york area for over a decade and still exist as just a non entity how is espn s coverage anyways i think it starts tonight we re getting the sabres bruins as the replacement game and probably so are you while the devils penguins game is played on scny and the islanders caps are the overflow game on the sca scny plus if the sabres bruins ends early then we ll go to the devils penguins game assuming that espn follows their previous patterns we got the last minute of the islanders rangers and all of the overtime two weeks ago espn s coverage started last night by accident but as one or more other writers have pointed out they could ve gone to wild hog wrestling for the evening instead gld je me souviens gary l dare gld columbia edu go winnipeg jets go gld cunixc bitnet selanne domi stanley

re thumbs up to espn i agree it was great for the espn people to show the detroit game my roommate just about sh t when they threw the octopus on the ice thanks for explaining the significance of that btw the only problem i had was when they blotted out the local commentators with the baseball ads and music especially when the wings player hit the rut and went into the boards injuring his shoulder and they blotted out the injury report other then that hats off to espn now if they ll only make a habit of this yeah right baseball seasons started zzzzzz koz lets go caps

hockey coverage this is a general question for us readers how extensive is the playoff coverage down there in canada it is almost impossible not to watch a series on tv ie the only two series i have not had an opportunity to watch this year are wash nyi and chi stl the latter because i m in the wrong time zone we in canada are basically swamped with coverage and i wonder how many series games are televised nationally or even locally in the us and how much precedence they take over say local news if the games go into double ot email me so as not to waste bandwidth please my news feed is kind of slow anyways l tr

blues into playoffs beat tb by dave luecking of the post dispatch staff at thursday night the scoreboard watchers at the arena began to cheer their cheer quickly turned into a roar and finally the sellout crowd of rose as one to rock the old barn at oakland avenue in a salute to the playoff bound blues the scoreboard had just flashed the news from detroit red wings stars with the north stars loss the blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the norris division good thing because the blues quit playing they held a lead over tampa bay when the detroit minnesota final appeared with minutes remaining in the second period they promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer tampa s bob beers tipped in a pass from shawn chambers but officiating supervisor john d amico and video goal judge rich schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired i m glad i didn t see it go in at the end blues coach bob berry said if the goal had counted he d have been more upset than he was by the blues disappearance in the final minutes holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered berry s anger it wasn t pretty at the end he said we played great minutes as good as we played all year it slipped away at the end it shouldn t have but it did still the blues won prompting another ovation from the crowd at game s end despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season the blues still made the playoffs they ll meet the chicago blackhawks in a best of seven norris division semifinal beginning at noon sunday at chicago stadium the blues finished the regular season with a record of for points their fourth consecutive plus season minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place with a record of for points tampa bay which played spoiler last week by tying the blues at tampa ended its first season with a record of for points the poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous blues locker room instead the mood was one of relief and some disappointment it s a shame we let down said kevin miller one of three blues to score two goals brendan shanahan and bob bassen were the others there was no need for a letdown if we d have kept working it would have ended and everyone would be happy instead a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs we won and that s all that matters said brett hull scoreless and minus for the night once we got up it was really tough to play some players didn t have a problem just because the score was announced our line didn t quit said rich sutter who played with bassen and miller we still had a game to play you can t allow five goals like we did that s not right it was disappointing to see what was going on bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the blues effort somehow he missed the announcement of minnesota s loss i didn t know it was final he said i was kind of looking around on the bench i didn t realize it was a final for some reason we re in the playoffs and that s great but it s a little disappointing to play like we did at the end the letdown was precisely the reason that berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the minnesota detroit score off of the board the score showed until it first popped up with detroit leading in the third period the blues already led at the time i told them i didn t want to see the score i didn t want to know the score berry said i felt we had to win the game and that s the approach we took if minnesota took a lead berry feared the pressure of having to win might bother the blues if detroit led he worried the blues might quit until the announcement the blues played splendidly shanahan got the crowd going at of the first period scoring his th of the season then miller and bassen took charge late in the period with the teams playing four on four miller broke in on left wing deked defenseman roman hamrlik and beat former blues goalie pat jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with seconds remaining in the period then just seconds later bassen rifled a long slap shot past jablonski after defenseman rick zombo intercepted a tampa pass in the neutral zone bassen made it just seconds into the second period scoring on the rebound of bret hedican s shot the goal gave him his first two goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend last year bassen befriended young oliver mulvihill who died of a rare form of cancer at age on feb i was thinking of my buddy oliver bassen said he s in heaven now and i know he was watching i know he s happy miller increased the blues lead to on a break away goal set up by zombo at then steve maltais broke curtis joseph s shutout just seconds later making it less than a minute after the north stars final was announced tim bergland scored and cut the lead to but shanahan scored his st converting a pass from nelson emerson with seconds remaining in the second period then it was all lightning adam creighton scored seconds into the third period prompting berry to rest the overworked joseph guy hebert allowed goals to shawn chambers and danton cole in a span of midway through the third period the goals by chambers and cole made shanahan s second goal stand up as the winner we were in there shanahan said the game was over we were in a l l e z l e s b l u e s joe ashkar contact for the blues saint louis jca cec wustl edu blues

did you really expect toronto to go anywhere really detroit is a very disciplined team there s a lot of europeans in detroit which would make the game fast so toronto would have to slow the game down which means drawing penalties as a last resort anyway toronto will be a good team as soon as they get more good players toronto is just an average team detroit isn t ballard screwed toronto when he was owner everyone knows that and it s going to take time for toronto to become a real force i expect gilmour to be burnt out next year he can t pull the whole team forever patrick walker university of new brunswick

kings playoff notes stauber tv ratings etc los angeles kings notes playoffs stauber disturbed by third man theme by rick sadowski daily news barry melrose s decision to stick robb stauber in the stands rather than in the crease or even on the bench for the stanley cup playoffs does not sit well with the rookie goaltender i want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year the most fun time of the year and i m not stauber said with some emotion monday i think i have worked hard enough for that stauber said he accepts melrose s choice of kelly hrudey as the teams top goalie in their playoff series with the calgary flames hrudey made saves in sundays opening victory but stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the no man behind rick knickle stauber had a record and goals against average down the stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the no job from hrudey knickle he won of decisions but had a bloated average twice was yanked from games once for stomach cramps and hasn t played since march yet when the series resumes wednesday knickle will serve as hrudey s backup again and stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on olympic saddledome popcorn if i m supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter i dropped too what happened to no stauber wondered not that i d be happy with no but i feel i should at least be a part of this team in the playoffs perhaps stauber eventually will get his chance but melrose apparently is not convinced the year old is capable of handling playoff pressure while insisting he is the kings goalie of the future melrose said stauber flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season they were according to melrose a loss to san jose on dec an loss to the new york rangers on jan a tie with detroit on feb an loss to vancouver on thursday four times this season robb could have emerged as the elite goalie he could have taken it away from kelly hrudey and he didn t do it melrose said an elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him the mark of a great goalie is that he isn t satisfied to be a backup i m not blaming robb for the losses but if you re going to be no you ve got to be able to walk your talk you ve got to be able to play when everything is on the line robb stauber has a great deal of ability but maybe i expect more from him than he does ouch that remark stung stauber he began the season struggled when the team hit a mid season slump didn t play for a month after knickle was signed off the san diego gulls roster then came on at the end i expect more from myself than anybody including barry melrose said stauber a three year star at the university of minnesota who left school in only to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries what i ve been through the last four years two knee operations a herniated disk in my back shoulder surgery what more can i go through i obviously do expect a lot from myself otherwise i wouldn t be here anybody who would disagree with that doesn t know me i m not saying barry doesn t know me but don t say i ve been without expectations if anything i m a perfectionist stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games melrose mentioned but even though i didn t play well i get knocked down from maybe on to three it s a bit of a jump he said you re almost no or if you play a good game you re no and if you don t you re no why does jack nicklaus shoot a and then a can you explain that that s what barry wanted me to explain to him why i didn t come through when he counted on me i don t know what i do know is it s a sport i ll be there melrose s goalie of the future statement doesn t mean much to stauber before you know it i ll be and there will be no future he said game of the kings flames playoff series drew a nielsen rating on abc channel here in la the kings averaged a nielsen rating in the regular season games aired on channel around the nhl san jose fired coach george kingston who lead the team to a mark in their nd nhl season kingston was over the past years with the sharks former islander executive bill torrey was named as president of the expansion florida panthers bobby clarke was named as the clubs general manager last nights games win van van leads tor det det leads stan willis willis empire dnet hac com net contact l a kings talk with the l a kings mailing list kings cs stanford edu to subscribe or unsubscribe kings request cs stanford edu

johnson adam graves can rod brind amour shayne corson shots on goal penalties attendance referee sweden min rob hearn usa canada min bill ranford stopped shots to lead canada to a victory in a very well played game the first period started with a give away from a canadian defenseman and rundqvist came in alone on ranford but couldn t put the puck over a sliding ranford later on kevin dineen had a great opportunity but soderstrom played very well too stefan nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up jan larsson but again ranford came up big period ended scoreless but the edge to sweden in creating more opportunities second period action saw tommy soderstrom making a great save mark recchi made a backhanded cross ice pass to lindros eric one timed the puck but soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save at the minute mark canada started applying pressure on the swedes sanderson dineen brind amour worked hard and kept the puck in the swedes zone dineen gave the puck to sanderson who skated around a screened swedish defenseman came in on soderstrom and made a wrist shot that went it by soderstrom s far post canada the swedes picked up their game after that and peter forsberg had a shot that hit ranford s post the inside went parallel to the goal line and out then gartner got a penalty and the swedes a power play jan larsson took a shot from the slot ranford gave a rebound to larsson who saw juhlin by the far post passed the puck and ranford was beat third period started as the other periods swedes having most of the pressure but the canadians always dangerous once they were close to the swede goal at canada created some great chances and arto blomsten was forced to cover the puck in the swede goal crease since soderstrom lost sight of it that resulted in a penalty shot since a defenseman can t cover the puck in the goal crease geoff sanderson took the penalty shot his first ever he explained afterwards and he put it low on soderstrom s stick side close to the post excellent penalty shot to give canada a go ahead goal canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside gartner volleyed a bouncing puck past soderstrom to make it the swedes ran out of gas then and couldn t produce as good scoring chances as they had for periods the goal came with only second left rod brind amour scoring on a rebound from soderstrom where the swedish defense already had their minds in the dressing room a very good game the best in the wc so far with both goalies playing great soderstrom best player in sweden but ranford even played better than soderstrom that tells you something about ranford probably the best goalie in the world were some comments after the game canada played a very disciplined defense ranford pointed out that it is easy to play well with a good defense lindros played a lot and played well sanderson naturally game hero with two goals the forsberg naslund bergqvist line sweden s best along with larsson juhlin nilsson swedish defense played well cm kg peter popovic had the task of neutralizing cm kg eric lindros and managed this very well ranger defenseman peter andersson finally got to go to the wc and considering that he landed in germany just a few hours before the game he played very well swedish coach curt lundmark was irritated after the game partly because of the swedes inability to score and partly because of the

re flyers re this year s biggest and worst opinion in article apr cbnewsh cb att com seth cbnewsh cb att com peter r clark jr writes so in other words if roussel shuts out the sharks and soderstrom shuts out the penguins that s immaterial because it was the coaches decision come on joe think about what you re saying who they played is very significant why they played them is what s irrelevent a low gaa against good teams is better than a low gaa against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders a low gaa is better then a higher gaa a low gaa against good teams is much much better than a higher gaa against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders let s start over i m not arguing about who is the better goaltender i d take soderstrom right now what i am saying is that roussel can be a netminder the gaa difference is less than half a goal per game less than that after last night their save percentages are close and their records are similar and with that i just don t see how you can label roussel as the most disappointing player on the flyers this season you say soderstrom played against better competition that may very well be but there is no way of knowing how roussel would have performed in those games besides against the better scoring teams like pittsburgh the defense is more keyed up than they are against san jose the same for roussel in the ranger game two real scoring chances one he made a great play the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player if you were judging roussel on that game alone you have very little to go by but i m not just judging roussel on that game alone i ve seen him play for the past two seasons in philly and before that in hershey it s just my opinion but i think he s got what it takes of course i thought that about mark laforest too but i never did about wendell young so i m batting in judging hershey talent since the hextall era as for the rangers game you can say he was saved by a mistake by the offensive player if you like but rou had his leg in position to make the save if he didn t it wouldn t have mattered if the rangers player didn t get the puck up or not it would have been a goal on a breakaway that s what the goalie wants to do take away as much as possible and force the shooter to beat him but if you were to look at the tie against the habs you saw a goalie stand on his head to get that shutout that was a goalie in action roussel doesn t have a game like that in him i seem to remember roussel doing an excellent job against pittsurgh on opening night to give the flyers a tie against the two time defending champs and not to take anything away from soderstrom because he was senational in that game agains the habs but you can t tell me that a montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game and just flat out missed it mistakes both on offense and defense are part of the game or there d never be shutouts anyway i m happy the flyers have both soderstrom and roussel and i m not going to argue about it anymore besides with the current game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year i don t want to piss you off to the point that you don t sell me any tickets next season joe dakes at t microelectronics union boulevard allentown pa let s go flyers alux jmd jmd aluxpo att com

flyers notes the flyers blew a lead over the buffalo sabres in the second period but kevin dineen s th career hat trick powered them to their th consecutive win over the sabres who have now lost in a row alexander mogilny led the comeback scoring his th and th goals of the season which tied the game at in the nd period and in the rd tommy soderstrom stopped of shots on goal to improve his own record to as he was tested by mogilny and lafontaine all night roster move andre faust was once again recalled from hershey shawn cronin was a healthy scratch lines eklund lindros recchi beranek brind amour dineen lomakin butsayev conroy faust acton brown galley bowen yushkevich hawgood carkner mcgill tommy soderstrom game summary say if anybody from buffalo is reading this where did you people get that woman who sang the anthems we had to turn down the volume the flyers defense started out the game showing everybody why the flyers have been shutting teams out lately by holding the sabres to only shots in the first period they then showed everybody why they will be playing golf sunday when they gave up shots in the last two periods maybe tommy told them that he was getting bored back there mark recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it after buffalo won the faceoff and dumped tommy wrapped the puck around the boards to eric way up on his left eric dropped it to galley and he sent it ahead to recchi steaming out of the zone mark skated into the center circle passed the puck to himself through the legs of richard smehlik skated around him and in on fuhr smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his stick recchi drifted right drifted back left and slid the puck back to the right past fuhr for a flyers lead at it was so beautiful eric and garry should turn down their assists the flyers kept the pressure on fuhr for a while after that but he was strong and kept the flyers from doing further damage the game then became a defensive struggle for a while the sabres got the first chance on the power play when terry carkner took a boarding minor at for crunching dale hawerchuk into the boards in the flyers zone lafontaine got the only scoring chance and not a terribly good one as the flyers smothered the sabres power play mogilny got a post after it was over the th consecutive penalty kill for the flyers keith carney took a holding penalty at for taking down mark recchi to give the flyers a power play the best penalty killing team in the league didn t allow the flyers a shot on goal although the flyers did create a good scoring chance for lindros who partially fanned on his shot towards the end of the period the play started going end to end but everybody kept missing the net greg hawgood took an interference penalty at to give the sabres another power play but they couldn t get anything going and the fans expressed their displeasure particularly when they iced the puck shots were buffalo after the flyers had led at one point mike emrick interviewed flyers president jay snider between periods jay was disappointed to not make the playoffs but not discouraged this was considered a rebuilding year after the trade and he seemed very happy with the way the season went when asked if he agonized over the trade he said that it was russ farwell s trade and not his that it only was an issue for him and ed snider as far as the money but yes there was some agonizing and they d do it all over again when asked how the coaching situation would be handled for next year he said that it s russ call and russ will evaluate things at the end of the season he feels that they re years away from a shot at the cup he expects to get into the playoffs next year have a shot at a division title the following year and a shot at the finals the year after that this based on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer he s very happy with the re alignment he called it outstanding happy with the current expansion feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux of europeans but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable seemed to like the idea of playing in the olympics booo but said that there was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in four years if there was a consensus the sabres gave the flyers their second power play of the game when brad may took a tripping penalty at of the second the flyers had a little trouble getting started but eventually did hawgood took a pass as he was moving throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to eklund just outside the sabres blue line along the right boards eklund carried into the zone nad passed across to dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the top of the left circle he half fanned on it and sent the puck trickling through the slot fuhr didn t know where it was though and hawgood won the race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at then mogilny on a breakaway he slipped through two flyers at the blue line and went in on soderstrom he went with the backhander but soderstrom was all over it the flyers then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them viacheslav butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor then according to gary dornhoefer took a dive to get the other there was no video at the sabres coudln t get started ryan mcgill poked at the puck just after a sabre carried into the flyers zone and after a bunch of people poked at it dineen emerged with it and headed the other way it started out a on but brind amour hustled ahead to make it a on and back off the defenseman dineen let it rip from the top of the right circle to make it flyers at that was all for fuhr john muckler sent in dominik hasek to take over but the sabres still had lots of power play time again they took some time to just get into the flyers zone and when they finally did the flyers were all over them boos began to ring through the building but they finally got through soderstrom on an ugly goal smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that missed and kicked out to hawerchuk in the slot hawerchuk tried a backhander as he skated towards the goal line to the right as galley dove down to block it mistake he should have let soderstrom handle the backhander and worried about a the rebound or b barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right next to the net well the rebound dropped right next to soderstrom and mistake galley just laid there and watched barnaby get three hacks at the puck before he finally pushed it through the goalie he didn t even swing his stick out to try and knock the puck away with the goal at two streaks end for the flyers of shutout hockey and straight penalty kills lindros put them right back on the power play at with a high sticking minor i think it was barnaby again this time the sabres were able to get set up quickly but couldn t get too much quality on goal the sabres continued to keep the puck in the flyers end for a while after the power play ended things evetually settled down but then the other very bad penalty mcgill allowed barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a faceoff the gloves were dropped and mcgill started pounding the crap out of him but during the fight he gave barnaby a head butt with his helmet and that meant a match penalty for slashing fighting and for the major minutes of power play time for the sabres at barnaby only got the flyers were keeping them at bay for a while but there was only so long they could do that after a couple of good sabre chances audette handed to ledyard at the point and ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by soderstrom lafontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of the net and knocked it over to randy wood at the right soderstrom had moved over to play lafontaine and since yushkevich and carkner were waving at the puck instead of picking up men wood just slid it into the empty net at to close the flyers lead to lafontaine was actually trying to put it on net but half fanned on it and got a break the flyers then got some shorthanded pressure in the sabres zone but hasek was strong finally it was keith carney passing ahead to hawerchuk into the neutral zone and hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to mogilny at the flyers blue line another mini breakaway for mogilny he elected to shoot from the left circle and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at for his th of the season ironically the youth hockey tip between the st and second period was tommy soderstrom talking about cutting off angles that was all in the nd shots were sabres into the rd period and pelle eklund blew a golden opportunity to get the flyers the lead back a on acton with the puck he dropped to eklund in the slot and eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until he had almost no angle at all to shoot from when he finally did shoot he hit the far post that was still during the carryover power play time than an incredible almost goal randy wood skated around recchi and hawgood untouched into soderstrom soderstrom goes down wood pokes the puck under soderstrom and a black object hits the back of the net red light comes on horn sounds crowd cheers but up to the video replay booth for some strange reason and in the meantime emrick and dornhoefer try to figure out what they could be reviewing well it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade that went into the net not the puck emrick mentions that one of the criteria for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net dave hannan then took out recchi and got a holding minor at the flyers could not get anything going at all they finally got set up way through but were kept on the perimeter as time ran out beranek stripped the puck from a sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across to eklund at the top of the left circle eklund saw dineen heading at the net just inside the right circle and passed through to him dineen fumbled the pass but twice directed it at hasek and eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing puck over the goalie for his th at flyers but the sabres came right back lafontaine picked up the puck in his offensive left corner and slid it to bob erry behind the flyers net erry started to skate out but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net mogilny flew in skated around and stuffed it through soderstrom s hole for his th at to tie the game at then hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at the flyers set up in the sabres zone and stayed there off a faceoff high in the sabres zone in the middle while brind amour wrestled for the puck dineen snuck through the line and wristed a perfect shot low to hasek s glove side at play started to go back and forth until hawgood took a roughing penalty at the flyers dumped the puck into the sabres zone brind amour and ledyard went after it and rod got the puck he backed away from the right boards skated to the right faceoff dot and passed between his legs to dineen crashing through the slot all by himself dineen waited patiently and lifted it over the blocker of hasek for a flyers lead at rd hat trick of the season for dineen th of his career nd shorthanded goal of the game for him th of the season then carney took a tripping penalty at to kill the rest of the sabres power play not much action on the on and the sabres got most of the chances on the flyers resulting power play play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to make some big saves the sabres weren t able to pull hasek as time was running out as the flyers wouldn t allow any consistant possession for the sabres finally as time was running out ken sutton misplayed the puck in his own left corner and brind amour stripped it away from him he pulled away and found dineen on the other side of the left circle and dineen found acton at the right of hasek he slid the puck between two sabres defenders and acton chipped it back to the far side of hasek for his th of the season at on his th birthday that was all the scoring shots were buffalo and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the game so another strong game from tommy soderstrom who hadn t been tested much in his last couple of starts kevin dineen has a career high point night unless he had a better night earlier in the season but i don t think so the flyers longest winning streak in years goals for only against with three shutouts eric lindros is th in league with even strength goals despite missing games with injury points out of th clinched th place since the rangers lose the tie breaker a couple misc notes forget the mike keenan rumors there will be a press conference tommorrow to announce that he will be head coach of the new york rangers next year in the last notes i mentioned that garry galley won the barry ashbee award but i failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman the times of trenton has reported that a preeminent specialist from oklahoma has looked over tommy soderstrom s medical record and determined that no further tests are necessary in the near future same paper had a blurb about bill

ripem frequently asked questions archive name ripem faq last update sun mar about this posting this is a still rather rough listing of likely questions and information about ripem a program for public key mail encryption it this faq not ripem was written and will be maintained by marc vanheyningen mvanheyn whale cs indiana edu it will be posted to a variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis follow up discussion specific to ripem is redirected to the group alt security ripem this month i have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply with the standards for hypertext faq formatting to allow easy manipulation of this document over the world wide web let me know what you think disclaimer nothing in this faq should be considered legal advice or anything other than one person s opinion if you want real legal advice talk to a real lawyer questions and answers what is ripem ripem is a program which performs privacy enhanced mail pem using the cryptographic techniques of rsa and des it allows your electronic mail to have the properties of authentication i e who sent it can be confirmed and privacy i e nobody can read it except the intended recipient ripem was written primarily by mark riordan mrr scss cl msu edu most of the code is in the public domain except for the rsa routines which are a library called rsaref licensed from rsa data security inc how can i get ripem ripem contains the library of cryptographic routines rsaref which is considered munitions and thus is export restricted from distribution to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the u s or canada therefore the following request is quoted from the readme file please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution outside of the usa or canada this is a personal request from me the author of ripem and a condition of your use of ripem note that rsaref is not in the public domain and a license for it is included with the distribution you should read it before using ripem the best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy since this will reduce the load on those sites that do carry it not to mention the humans that run them naturally this requires that you trust the friend ripem is available via anonymous ftp to citizens and permanent residents in the u s from rsa com cd to rsaref and read the readme file for info last i looked this site contains only the source tree and does not contain compiled binaries or the nice mac version ripem as well as some other crypt stuff has its home site on rpub cl msu edu which is open to non anonymous ftp for users in the u s and canada who are citizens or permanent residents to find out how to obtain access ftp there cd to pub crypt and read the file getting access for convenience binaries for many architectures are available here in addition to the full source tree will ripem run on my machine probably it has already been ported to ms dos and most flavors of unix sunos next linux aix ultrix solaris etc ports to macintosh include a standard unix style port and a rather nice mac like port written by raymond lau author of stuffit more ports are expected and help of users is invited will ripem work with my mailer probably how easy and clean the effective interface is will depend on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer though the users guide included with the distribution discusses ways to use ripem with many popular mailers including berkeley mush elm and mh code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of ripem inside gnu emacs if you make a new interface for ripem or create an improvement on one in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use secure and may be useful to others feel free to post it to alt security ripem what is rsa rsa is a crypto system which is asymmetric or public key this means that there are two different related keys one to encrypt and one to decrypt because one cannot reasonably be derived from the other you may publish your encryption or public key widely and keep your decryption or private key to yourself anyone can use your public key to encrypt a message but only you hold the private key needed to decrypt it note that the message sent with rsa is normally just the des key to the real message see what is des note that the above only provides for privacy for authentication the fingerprint of the message see what is a fingerprint like md is encrypted with the sender s private key the recipient can use the sender s public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message must have come from the sender rsa was named for the three men rivest shamir and adleman who invented it to find out more about rsa ftp to rsa com and look in pub faq or look in sci crypt what is des des is the data encryption standard a widely used symmetric or secret key crypto system unlike rsa des uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages however des is much faster than rsa ripem uses both des and rsa it generates a random key and encrypts your mail with des using that key it then encrypts that key with the recipient s public rsa key and includes the result in the letter allowing the recipient to recover the des key des is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a key length considered too short by modern standards however it should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large corporation or government agency it is not unlikely that future ripems will strengthen the symmetric cipher possibly by using multiple encryption with des what is pem and how does ripem relate pem is privacy enhanced mail a system for allowing easy transfer of encrypted electronic mail it is described in rfcs these documents have been approved and obsolete the old rfcs ripem is not really a complete implementation of pem because pem specifies certificates for authenticating keys which ripem does not handle at this time their addition is planned what s this about distributing and authenticating keys for a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you she must know your public key for you to be able to confirm that the message received came from her you must know her public key it is important that this information be accurate if a bad guy convinces her that his key is in fact yours she will send messages which he can read ripem allows for three methods of key management a central server the distributed finger servers and a flat file all three are described in the ripem users guide which is part of the distribution none of them provide perfect security why do all ripem public keys look very similar ripem public keys begin with a pkcs identifier describing various characteristics about the key so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as those of lots of other people s keys this does not mean your keys are similar but only that they are the same class of key were generated with the same program are of the same length etc what is a fingerprint like md md is a message digest algorithm produced by rsa data security inc it provides a bit fingerprint or cryptographically secure hash of the plaintext it is cryptographically secure because it is not possible in a reasonable amount of computation to produce a different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint thus instead of signing the entire message with the sender s private key only the md of the message needs to be signed for authentication md is sometimes used for other purposes for example it is often used to map an input of arbitrary length to bits of data as a passphrase interpreter or cookie generator md is described in its entirety including an implementation in c in rfc what is pgp pgp is another cryptographic mail program called pretty good privacy pgp has been around longer than ripem and works somewhat differently pgp is not compatible with ripem in any way though pgp does also use rsa some major differences between pgp and ripem pgp has more key management features particularly for users without a direct network connection ripem conforms to the pem rfcs and thus has a greater probability of working with other pem software pgp makes no attempt to be compatible with anything other than pgp in fact pgp is not compatible with pgp ripem uses rsaref a library of rsa routines from rsa data security inc rsaref comes with a license which allows noncommercial use pgp uses its own implementation of rsa which is not licensed thus pkp the firm holding the u s patents on the rsa algorithm claims that it is a infringement of that patent to make use or sell pgp in the u s or canada in acknowledgement of this pgp s original author phil zimmermann says in the documentation in fact if you live in the usa and you are not a federal agency you shouldn t actually run pgp on your computer because public key partners wants to forbid you from running my software pgp is contraband both pgp and ripem are export restricted and cannot be sent outside the u s and canada however pgp already exists on many ftp sites in europe and other places whether you use pgp or ripem or whatever the documentation to pgp is recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues note that the above facts both regarding patent and export restrictions are somewhat controversial many people think it shouldn t be that way and some people interpret various documents differently unfortunately discussions of it on the net inevitably seem to produce more heat than light and probably belong in misc legal computing see disclaimer what about rpem rpem stands for rabin privacy enhanced mail it was similar to ripem but used a public key cipher invented by rabin which is not rsa in an attempt to avoid the patent on rsa it was written by mark riordan the same author as ripem its distribution was halted when contrary to the beliefs of many including rabin public key partners pkp claimed that their patent was broad enough to cover any public key cipher whose strength rested in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes not just rsa this claim is not universally accepted by any means but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons rpem is not really used anymore it is not compatible with ripem or pgp what is mime mime stands for multipurpose internet mail extensions and is described in rfc you can find out about it in the newsgroup comp mail mime how pem should interact with mime is not yet entirely clear some people use the stopgap solution of having a mime type application x ripem in order to send ripem messages as mime ones i hope some standards will emerge draft internet documents exist on the matter i have this simple way to defeat the security of ripem you may wish to check the companion post ripem attacks which discusses some of the more obvious attacks on ripem s security and what procedures will minimize the risk ripem s main weak area is probably key distribution

not altered rsa was named for the three men rivest shamir and adleman who invented it to find out lots more about rsa and modern cryptography in general ftp to rsa com and look in pub faq some information also may be in sci crypt what is des des is the data encryption standard a widely used symmetric or secret key crypto system unlike rsa des uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages however des is much faster than rsa ripem uses both des and rsa it generates a random key and encrypts your mail with des using that key it then encrypts that key with the recipient s public rsa key and includes the result in the letter allowing the recipient to recover the des key des is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a key length considered too short by modern standards however it should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large corporation or government agency it is not likely that the pem standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the near future because there is a strong feeling that pem should be stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with interoperability what is a fingerprint like md md is a message digest algorithm produced by rsa data security inc it provides a bit fingerprint or cryptographically secure hash of the plaintext it is cryptographically secure because it is not possible in a reasonable amount of computation to produce a different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint thus instead of signing the entire message with the sender s private key only the md of the message needs to be signed for authentication md s can also be exchanged directly for authentication for example ripem public keys include an md of the public key in the file so parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate channel merely need exchange md s of keys and verify their accuracy md is sometimes used for other purposes for example it is often used to map an input of arbitrary length to bits of data as a passphrase interpreter or cookie generator md is described in its entirety including an implementation in c in rfc there have been some recent suggestions that md may not be as strong a hash as was originally believed presumably some other hash function will be used if this is accepted as true what is pem pem is privacy enhanced mail a standard for allowing transfer of encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a working group of experts it is described in rfcs these documents have been approved and obsolete the old rfcs ripem is not really a complete implementation of pem because pem specifies certificates for authenticating keys which ripem does not handle at this time their addition is planned what s this about distributing and authenticating keys for a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you she must know your public key for you to be able to confirm that the message received came from her you must know her public key it is important that this information be accurate if a bad guy convinces her that his key is in fact yours she will send messages which he can read ripem allows for three methods of key management a central server the distributed finger servers and a flat file all three are described in the ripem users guide which is part of the distribution none of them provide perfect security the pem standard calls for key management by certificates the addition of this feature to ripem is planned but chicken egg issues still exist isn t it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like pem this issue has been considered in the standards process rfc the specification for internet standards has a discussion section on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be met for a patented method to be included in a standard rfc addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public key cryptography this does not of course mean that all questions are settled or that everyone is in agreement an interesting exchange on the use of patented algorithms in standards with regard to public key cryptography is in the league for programming freedom archive available via ftp ftp uu net doc lpf in the files bidzos letter and bidzos response amusingly the lpf files on ftp uu net are compressed with a patented algorithm what about rsadsi pkp rsa data security inc rsadsi is a california based company specializing in cryptographic technologies public key partners is a firm which holds exclusive sub licensing rights of the following u s patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents cryptographic apparatus and method diffie hellman no public key cryptographic apparatus and method hellman merkle no cryptographic communications system and method rsa no exponential cryptographic apparatus and method hellman pohlig no pkp claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key cryptography the two businesses are rather closely related for example the same person jim bidzos is president of both of them pkp has licensed this technology to a considerable number of companies ibm dec motorola at t lotus for use in their products pkp has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their patents ripem was originally created with no connection to rsadsi other than its use of the rsaref library and for no reason other than its author s desire to see widespread use of public key cryptography however after the ball started rolling people at rsadsi got interested rsadsi decided to carry ripem on its ftp site and some people there started making their own ripem keys and contributing code ripem even won the best application built on rsaref in award why do all ripem public keys look very similar ripem public keys begin with a pkcs public key cryptography standards identifier describing various characteristics about the key so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as those of lots of other people s keys this does not mean your keys are similar but only that they are the same class of key were generated with the same program are of the same length etc what is pgp pgp is another cryptographic mail program called pretty good privacy pgp has been around longer than ripem and works somewhat differently pgp is not compatible with ripem in any way though pgp does also use rsa a few major differences between pgp and ripem pgp has more key management features particularly for users without a direct network connection ripem conforms to the pem rfcs and thus has a greater probability of working with other pem software pgp makes no attempt to be compatible with anything other than itself ripem uses rsaref a library of rsa routines from rsadsi which comes with a license allowing noncommercial use pgp uses its own implementation of rsa pkp claims that it is a violation of its patents to make use or sell pgp in the u s or canada without either a license or written permission see disclaimer see what about rsadsi pkp phil zimmermann the author of pgp stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal action he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged but it hasn t happened and there seems little prospect of it happening in the future he acknowledges in the pgp user s guide in fact if you live in the usa and you are not a federal agency you shouldn t actually run pgp on your computer because public key partners wants to forbid you from running my software pgp is contraband both pgp and ripem are export restricted and cannot be sent outside the u s and canada without an export license however pgp already exists on many ftp sites in europe and other places whether you use pgp or ripem or whatever the documentation to pgp is recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues unfortunately it s not distributed separately from the program which can be difficult to find in the u s on ftp sites due to liability concerns what about rpem rpem stands for rabin privacy enhanced mail it was similar to ripem but used a public key cipher invented by rabin which is not rsa in an attempt to avoid the patents on public key systems it was written by mark riordan who later wrote ripem its distribution was halted when contrary to the beliefs of many including rabin pkp claimed that their patents were broad enough to cover the cipher employed this claim is not universally accepted but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons rpem is not really used anymore it is not compatible with ripem or pgp what is mime mime stands for multipurpose internet mail extensions and is described in rfc you can find out about it in the newsgroup comp mail mime a faq exists on it how pem should interact with mime is not yet entirely clear some people use the stopgap solution of having a mime type application x ripem in order to send ripem messages as mime ones i hope some standards will emerge draft internet documents exist on the matter what is tis pem trusted information systems is working on a version of privacy enhanced mail for general availability last i heard it was rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent mh rather than a stand alone system and in beta test i don t know much more than that i have this simple way to defeat the security of ripem you may wish to check the companion post ripem attacks which discusses some of the more obvious attacks on ripem s security and what procedures will minimize the risk ripem s main weak area is probably key distribution
ripem frequently noted vulnerabilities archive name ripem attacks last update mar some possible attacks on ripem this is a living list of potential weaknesses to keep your eyes open for when using ripem for secure electronic mail it does not go into great detail and is almost certainly not exhaustive obviously many of the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in general and will pertain to secure mail programs other than ripem it is maintained by marc vanheyningen mvanheyn cs indiana edu it is posted monthly to a variety of news groups followups pertaining specifically to ripem should go to alt security ripem cryptanalysis attacks breaking rsa would allow an attacker to find out your private key in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign messages with your private key rsa is generally believed to be resistant to all standard cryptanalytic techniques even a standard key about bits with ripem is long enough to render this impractical barring a huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring breaking des would allow an attacker to read any given message since the message itself is encrypted with des it would not allow an attacker to claim to be you des has only bits in its key and thus could conceivably be compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware but few agencies have such money to devote to simply read one message since each message has a different des key the work for each message would remain high key management attacks stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking rsa to safeguard it it is encrypted with a des key which is derived from a passphrase you type in however if an attacker can get a copy of your private keyfile and your passphrase by snooping network packets tapping lines or whatever he could break the whole scheme the main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the private key file across an untrusted link so don t do that run ripem on a trusted machine preferably one sitting right in front of you ideally your own machine in your own home or maybe office which nobody else has physical access to fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him rather than to the real recipient if the enemy can fool your intended recipient as well he could re encrypt the messages with the other bogus public key and pass them along it is important to get the proper public keys of other people the most common mechanism for this is finger assuming the opponent has not compromised routers or daemons or such finger can be given a fair amount of trust the strongest method of key authentication is to exchange keys in person however this is not always practical having other people vouch for you by signing a statement containing your key is possible although ripem doesn t have features for doing this as automatically as pgp ripem does generate and check md fingerprints of public keys in the key files they may be exchanged via a separate channel for authentication playback attacks even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography an opponent could still cause difficulties for example suppose you send a message with mic only a pem mode which does not provide disclosure protection to alice which says ok let s do that your opponent intercepts it and now resends it to bob who now has a message which is authenticated as from you telling him to do that of course he may interpret it in an entirely different context or your opponent could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later figuring it would be seen differently at a later time or the opponent could change the originator name to himself register your public key as his and send a message hoping the recipient will send him return mail indicating perhaps even quoting the unknown message to defeat playback attacks the plaintext of each message should include some indication of the sender and recipient and a unique identifier typically the date a good front end script for ripem should do this automatically imho as a recipient you should be sure that the originator name header and the sender indicated within the plaintext are the same that you really are a recipient and that the message is not an old one some this also can and should be automated the author of this faq has made a modest attempt at automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated headers the programs are included in the standard distribution in the utils directory local attacks clearly the security of ripem cannot be greater than the security of the machine where the encryption is performed for example under unix a super user could manage to get at your encrypted mail although it would take some planning and effort to do something like replace the ripem executable with a trojan horse or to get a copy of the plaintext depending how it s stored in addition the link between you and the machine running ripem is an extension of that if you decrypt with ripem on a remote machine which you are connected to via network or worse yet modem an eavesdropper could see the plaintext and probably also your passphrase ripem should only be executed on systems you trust obviously in the extreme case ripem should only be used on your own machine which you have total control over and which nobody else has access to which has only carefully examined software known to be free of viruses and so on however there s a very real trade off between convenience and security here a more moderately cautious user might use ripem on a unix workstation where other people have access even root access but increase security by keeping private keys and the statically linked of course executable on a floppy disk some people will keep ripem on a multi user system but when dialing in over an insecure line they will download the message to their own system and perform the ripem decryption there however the security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory since you presumably type your cleartext password to log in you ve just given away the store since the attacker can now log in as you and install traps in your account to steal your private key next time you use it from a less insecure line this will likely remain the situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of cleartext password authentication i find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully i manage my security arrangement in my plan next to my public key so that potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are in place some people use two keys a short one which is not carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated with greater care for critical correspondence untrusted partner attacks ripem s encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the traffic however once someone with that key gets the message she may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes there exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient say taking an encrypted message and converting it to a mic only message signed by you and readable by anyone although ripem does not provide this functionality indeed the latest pem draft i have seen specifically states that such transformations should be possible to allow forwarding functions to work including the recipients in the plaintext as mentioned above will make it possible for recipients of a redistributed message to be aware of its original nature naturally the security of the cryptography can never be greater than the security of the people using it

declassifying media there are many urban legends maybe this ought to be in the crypt faq about what is actually sufficient to clear or declassify magnetic media when used for classified data here is some information from the horse s mouth regarding the sufficient overwriting of media clearing meant to be retained within the controlled environment or declassifying the material to be reused outside the controlled environment from national telecommunications and information systems security ntiss advisory memorandum on office automation security guidelines ntissam compusec clearing of magnetic media certain types of removable media e g magnetic tape floppy disk cassettes and magnetic cards may be cleared by overwriting the entire media one time with any one character floppy disks may be cleared by applying a vendor s formatting program that overwrites each location with a given character fixed media e g winchester disks should be cleared by overwriting at least one time with any one character one way to do this is by applying a vendor supplied formatting program that overwrites each location on the disk with a given character if it can be shown that this program actually works as advertised the user should beware some programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not actually do this cleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or released for destruction however they should be marked and controlled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of information ever recorded declassification of magnetic media certain types of removable media can be declassified using a degaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of that type a list of approved devices is maintained by the nsa if a fixed medium for example a hard or winchester disk is operative an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to employ an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all addressable locations at least three times by writing any character then its complement e g binary ones and binary zeros alternatively when fixed media become inoperative it is impossible to declassify the media by the overwrite method in this case there are two alternate procedures that may be used disassemble the disk pack and degauss each platter with the appropriate approved degaussing equipment and courier the inoperative media to the vendor s facility have the magnetic media e g disk platter removed in sight of the courier and returned to the courier for destruction at the secure site the vendor can then install new platters and repair any other problems with the disk unit destruction of magnetic media see dod computer security center department of defense magnetic remanence security guideline csc std for official use only this and many other interesting documents many that are more informative than probably intended on computer security procedures can be obtained free from executive secretary national telecommunications and informations systems security committee national security agency fort george g meade md write them it s fun to be on the nsa s mailing list grady netcom com ef e ad d d c f fc ac f d f e f

licensing this thread brings up the more general question can any crypto implementation for which highly publicly scrutinized source code is not available ever be trusted after ibm had invented the des and the nbs had advertised for proposals but before ibm had decided to respond i argued strenuously that they should not they should keep it proprietary the biggest proponent of proposing was dr lewis branscomb dr branscomb was the ibm chief scientist and had come to ibm from nbs fortunately for all of us dr branscomb understood the answer to the above question much better than i he realized how difficult it would be to gain acceptance for any cryptographic mechanism because of the necessary complexity publicity would not be sufficient and neither would authority in fact it has taken both of those plus more than years we have also had independence the des was solicited by nbs invented and proposed by ibm and vetted by nbs it has also been examined and vetted by experts like adi shamir who are not subject to influence by any of these even now there are still people posting on this list who do not trust the des in spite of all the time all of the analysis and all of the public scrutiny of course it is just this point that nist misses when it attempts to gain acceptance for a novel mechanism developed in secret on the basis of authority alone we had a long thread here about whether or not the nsa can break the des that is a silly question at some cost and in some time they can break anything the important question is at what cost and in what time the fundamental strength of the des and rsa are not nearly so important as what we know about their strength as long as we understand the cost and duration for an attacker then we can use them in a safe way at this point we may never replace either because of the inability of any successor to overcome this knowledge gap des and rsa are among the most significant inventions of the century and the most important inventions in the history of cryptography we are damned lucky to have them william hugh murray executive consultant information system security locust avenue suite new canaan connecticut att wmurray whmurray at dockmaster ncsc mil

re hard drive security for fbi targets rja cl cam ac uk ross anderson writes in article apr ucsu colorado edu cuffell spot colorado edu tim cuffel writes this suggests a new pc security product design approach first fill the hard drive with random files and files encrypted under a number of known keys then whenever a new secret file is created you delete a random file and replace it with real encrypted data new non secret files are encrypted under a known key better yet instead of thrashing around on the dos file system take it a step further write yourself a minimal file system program that is used to create delete files en decrypt them to ramdisk list a directory put the util password protected on a floppy the catch is that the storage space used by this util is not part of the dos file system instead defrag your disk thus packing all allocated clusters into clusters n then use the back end of the partition to hold your stealth file system or leave a small nd partition on the disk that is not assigned to dos another approach might be to use a directory that contains a set of invariant files dos system files for instance due to dos allocating a minimum storage unit of a cluster there is unused physical space on the disk between the tail end of each file and the end of its associated cluster these dead spaces could be concatenated and used to hold your stealth file system now you have a situation where no encrypted data appears on your disk at all ray berry kb ht ray ole cdac com rjberry eskimo com compuserve com

maintained by j helsingius identity what is identity on the internet generally today people s identity on the internet is primarily determined by their email address in the sense that this is their most unchanging face in the electronic realm this is your login name qualified by the complete address domain information for example ld longs lance colostate edu people see this address when receiving mail or reading usenet posts from you and in other situations where programs record usage some obsolete forms of addresses such as bitnet still persist in email messages additional information on the path that a message takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient this information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination this type of identify and forward protocol is also used in the usenet protocol to a lesser extent forging these fields requires corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and is very uncommon not so uncommon is forging the chain at the origination point so that all initial sites in the list are faked at the time the message is created tracing these messages can be difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of real machines and represent real transfer routes why is identity un important on the internet the concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication privacy and security which in turn are all critical aspects of computer networks for example the convenience of communication afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for identification but there are many potential abuses of identity possible that can have very severe consequences with massive computer networks at the forefront of the issue which can potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems verifying that an identity is correct is called authentication and one classic example of the problems associated with it is h g well s war of the worlds radio broadcast that fooled segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was in progress hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on usenet and forged identities makes them more insidious people and their reputations can be assaulted by forgery however the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of its most attractive features identity is just as useful as it is harmful a professor might carefully explain a topic until he finds he is talking to an undergraduate a person of a particular occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally shun him some prejudices are erased but on the other hand many prejudices are useful a scientist might argue he can better evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more about the authors likewise he may be more likely to reject it based on unfair or irrelevant criteria on the other side of the connection the author may find identities of reviewers useful in exerting pressure for acceptance identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating credit not necessarily financial and ownership and usage many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques for identification heavy reliance will be placed on digital authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic many government functions and services are based on identification and law enforcement frequently hinges on it hence employees of many government organizations push toward stronger identification structures but when does identification invade privacy the growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive proportions decisions made now on issues of identity will affect many future users especially as the network becomes increasingly global universal widespread and entrenched and the positive or adverse affects of these actions intended and inadvertent will literally be magnified exponentially how does my email address not identify me and my background your email address may contain information that influences people s perceptions of your background the address may identify you as from a department at a particular university an employee at a company or a government worker it may contain your last name initials or cryptic identification codes independent of both in the us some are based on parts of social security numbers others are in the form u where the number is incremented in the order that new users are added to the system standard internet addresses also can contain information on your broad geographical location or nationhood however none of this information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all the fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on rather arbitrary organization such as mostly invisible network cabling distributions the only point to make is that early fields in the address are more specific such as specific computer names or local networks and the later ones the most general such as continental domains typically the first field is the name of the computer receiving mail gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise for more information see the faqs on email addresses and known geographical distributions below however unix utilities exist to aid in the quest see the question on this common suffixes us united states uk united kingdom ca canada fi finland au australia edu university or college com commercial organization org other e g nonprofit organization gov government mil military site how can i find out more about somebody with a given email address one simple way is to send email to that address asking another way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address i e postmaster address although the postmaster s job is more to help find user id s of particular people given their real name and solve mail routing problems the sysadmin i e root address may also be able to supply information users with related email address may have information however all of these methods rely on the time and patience of others so use them minimally one of the most basic tools for determining identity over the internet is the unix utility finger the basic syntax is finger user here there everywhere this utility uses communication protocols to query the computer named in the address for information on the user named the response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may be in any format possible responses are as follows a message unknown host meaning some aspect of the address is incorrect two lines with no information and a message in real life in which case the receiving computer could not find any kind of a match on the username the finger utility may return this response in other situations a listing of information associated with multiple users some computers will search only for matching user ids others will attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all actual full names of users kept in a local database at some sites finger can be used to get a list of all users on the system with a finger address in general this is often considered weak security however because attackers know valid user id s to crack passwords more information on the fields returned by finger is given below more information on finger and locating people s email addresses is given in the email faq such as the whois lookup utility just as you can use these means to find out about others they can use them to find out about you you can finger yourself to find out what is publicly reported by your unix system about you be careful when modifying finger data virtually anyone with internet access worldwide can query this information in one amazing case the new york times writer j markoff uncovered the identity of r morris author of the internet worm through the use of an anonymous tip and finger see the book cyberspace by k hafner and j markoff why is identification un stable on the internet generally identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept on the internet for a variety of reasons one is the inherent fluidity of cyberspace where people emerge and submerge frequently and absences are not readily noted in the community most people remember faces and voices the primary means of casual identification in the real world the arbitary and cryptic sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique identification of an individual who may use multiple accounts on multiple machines anywhere in the world currently internet users do not really have any great assurances that the messages in email and usenet are from who they appear to be a person s mailing address is far from an identification of an individual anyone with access to the account e g they know the password either legitimately or otherwise can send mail with that address in the from line email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations as part of current mailing protocol standards forging the from line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many hackers the status and path information prepended to messages by intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable in general while possible forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in email besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic problems with today s internet protocols affecting identification on the internet internet mail standards described in rfc are still evolving rapidly and not entirely orderly for example standards for mail address munging or parsing tend to vary slightly between sites and frequently mean the difference between finding addresses and bouncing mail domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites and there are delays in the propagation of this data addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers crash such as the receiving computer or other computers involved in resolving names into addresses called nameservers a whole slew of problems is associated with nameservers if they are not updated they will not find name addresses and even the operation of what constitutes updating has different interpretations at different sites the current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly anachronistic in that they were created when the network was somewhat obscure and not widespread with only a fraction of the traffic it now sees today a large proportion of internet traffic is email comprising millions of messages what is the future of identification on the internet some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images and voice messages into mail and these will improve the sense of community that comes from the familiarity of identification however they are not currently widespread require large amounts of data transfer standardized software and make some compromises in privacy promising new cryptographic techniques may make digital signatures and digital authentication common see below also the trend in usenet standards is toward greater authentication of posted information on the other hand advances in ensuring anonymity such as remailers are forthcoming see below privacy what is privacy on the internet generally while privacy has multiple connotations in society and perhaps even more on the internet in cyberspace most take it to mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the data stored on and and directed to it such as email and you do not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches in other words others may obtain data associated with your account but not without your permission these ideas are probably both fairly limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users consider their private domains some users don t expect or want any privacy some expect and demand it why is privacy un important on the internet this is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic arousing passionate opinions on the internet some take privacy for granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent most governments have rules that protect privacy such as the illegal search and seizure clause of the u s constitution adopted by others but have many that are antithetical to it such as laws prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping these rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules governing it however the legal repercussions of the global internet are still largely unknown and untested i e no strong legal precedents and court cases the fact that internet traffic frequently passes past international boundaries and is not centrally managed significantly complicates and strongly discourages its regulation how in secure are internet networks theoretically people at any site in the chain of sites with access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the internet could potentially monitor or archive it however the sheer volume and general noise inherent to this data makes these scenarios highly improbable even by government agencies with supposedly vast funding and resources technologies exist to tap magnetic fields given off by electrical wires without detection less obscurely any machine with a network connection is a potential station for traffic detection but this scenario requires knowledge and access to very low level hardware the network card to pursue if even possible a company network general inc is one of many that manufactures and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can filter and read packets by arbitrary criteria for troubleshooting purposes but the cost of this type of device is prohibitive for casual use known instances of the above types of security breaches at a major scale such as at network hubs are very rare the greatest risks tend to emerge locally note that all these approaches are almost completely defused with the use of cryptography how in secure is my account by default not very there are a multitude of factors that may reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet first your account must be secure from other users the universal system is to use a password but if it is weak i e easy to guess this security is significantly diminished somewhat surprisingly and frighteningly to some certain users of the system particularly the administrator generally have unlimited access regardless of passwords and may grant that access to others this means that they may read any file in your account without detection furthermore not universally known most unix systems keep fairly extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in what commands you execute and when they are executed in fact login information is usually public most features of this auditing or process accounting information are enabled by default after the initial installation and the system administrator may customize it to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims this information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting purposes and may otherwise be ignored this data tracks unsuccessful login attempts and other suspicious activities on the system a traditional part of the unix system that tracks user commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of symbolic links described in man ln unix implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies regularly typically system adminstrators augment the basic unix functionality with public domain programs and locally developed tools for monitoring and use them only to isolate suspicious activity as it arises e g remote accesses to the passwd file incorrect login attempts remote connection attempts etc generally you should expect little privacy on your account for various reasons potentially every keystroke you type could be intercepted by someone else system administrators make extensive backups that are completely invisible to users which may record the states of an account over many weeks erased files can under many operating systems be undeleted most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or otherwise for example ftp sites usually log the commands and record the domain originations of users including anonymous ones some software exacerbates these problems see the section on x windows in security indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users a much more commonly harmful threat there are multiple ways to help ensure that your account will not be accessed by others and compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines choose a secure password change it periodically make sure to logout always do not leave a machine unattended for long make sure no one watches you when you type your password avoid password references in email be conservative in the use of the rhost file use utilities like xlock to protect a station but be considerate be wary of situations where you think you should supply your password there are only several basic situations where unix prompts you for a password when you are logging in to a system or changing your password situations can arise in which prompts for passwords are forged by other users especially in cases where you are talking to them such as internet relay chat also be aware that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain passwords thanks to jim mattson mattson cs ucsd edu for contributions here how in secure are my files and directories the most important privacy considerations are related to file rights and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature or haphazard maintenance be aware of the rights associated with your files and directories in unix if the x execute right on your parent directory is off for users groups and other these users cannot gain information on anything in your directories anything less may allow others to read change or even delete files in your home directory the rights on a directory supersede the rights associated with files in that directory for a directory x means that access to the files or subdirectories in the directory is possible if you know their names to list the contents of the directory however requires the r right by default most accounts are accessable only to the owner but the initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator preference the default file mode specifies the initial rights associated with newly created files and can be set in the shell with umask the details of rights implementations tend to vary between versions of unix consult man pages on chmod and ls examples traver lance ls ld drwx ld jan users ld here is a listing of the rights associated with a user s home directory denoted by the columns at the left identify what rights are available the first column identifies the entry as a directory and the next three columns mean that read write and execute rights respectively are permitted for that user for directories the x right means that contents file and subdirectory names within that directory can be listed the subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to anything in the directory tree originating at that point they can t even see any lower files or subdirectories the hierarchy is completely invisible to them traver lance ls l msg rw r r ld jan msg traver lance chmod u rw g o msg traver lance ls l msg rw ld jan msg here the modes on the file msg were changed to take away rights from group and other note that ls l file requires both the r right to get the list of files and subdirectories and the x right to access the files and subdirectories in order to get their size etc for example suppose the directory foo has rights dr r r the following is possible ls foo these commands would fail independent of file rights ls l foo ls l foo file cat foo file cd foo if the directory foo has rights d x x x the following are possible if it is known beforehand that foo contains an r readable file named file ls l foo file cat foo file cd foo the following commands fail ls foo ls l foo thanks to uwe waldmann uwe mpi sb mpg de for contributions here how in secure is x windows x windows is the primary software developed by the mit athena project which is funded by u s government grants to develop applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing computational tasks particularly the human computer interface the software implements a client server interface to a computer via graphical windows in this case the client is the application requesting or utilizing graphical resources such as windows or a mouse and the server is the machine that provides them in many situations the client is an application program running on the same machine as the server the great utility of x windows comes from its complete dissociation of the client and server so that windows may be broadcast to a server at a remote location from the client unfortunately this dynamic power also introduces many deep intricate and complicated security considerations the primary security and privacy issue associated with x windows is that much more sensitive data may be sent over a network and over wider regions than in the case where the human is situated near the host computer currently there is no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in x windows due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design flaws early versions of the x window system are extremely insecure anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt that display or read it electronically based on access to the device unix by any regular user there are no protections from this type of access in these versions the problem arises because the security is completely based on machine addresses rather than users such that any user at a trusted machine is himself trusted quoting from x documentation man xsecurity any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed access to the x server this system can work reasonably well in an environment where everyone trusts everyone or when only a single person can log into a given machine this system does not work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and mutual trust does not exist with the access control list the xhost command may prevent some naive attempts i e those other than the direct access unix evasion the syntax as typed on the host machine is xhost name where name is the domain name or internet address of an authorized client machine by default clients running nonlocal to the host are disabled public domain programs to disrupt a display momentarily such as flip or slowly mirror the screen image or cause pixels to melt down to the bottom have been circulating on the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks on unsuspecting or inexperienced users much more serious security breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this inherent weaknesses the minimal easily bypassed trusted security mode of xhost has been jokingly referred to as x hanging open security terrible new versions of the x window system x r and higher by default make server access as secure as the file system using a xauthority file and magic cookies remote machines must have a code in the xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code allowed by the server many older programs and even new vendor supplied code does not support or is incompatible with magic cookies the basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of keys occurs in transmission x r also includes other sophisticated encryption mechanisms try man xsecurity to find out what is supported at your site even though improved security mechanisms have been available in x windows since local sites often update this software infrequently because installation is extremely complex thanks to marc vanheyningen mvanheyn whale cs indiana edu jim mattson mattson cs ucsd edu and bill marshall marshall cs iastate edu for contributions here how in secure is my email by default not very the characters that you are reading are almost certainly encoded in ascii the american standard code for information interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic characters onto numeric codes and vice versa virtually every computer system uses this code and if not has ways of converting to and from it when you write a mail message by default it is being sent in ascii and since the standard is virtually universal there is no intrinsic privacy despite milleniums worth of accumulated cryptographic knowledge cryptographic technologies are only recently being established that afford high priority to privacy as a primary criteria in computer and network design some potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows the most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous system operators reading private mail in the spool files at a local site i e at the source or destination of the message such as a university system administrators may also release files to law enforcement agencies but conventions and protocols for warrants involving computer searches have still not been strongly established and tested legally note that bounced messages go to postmasters at a given site in their entirety this means that if you address mail with an incorrect address it has a good chance of being seen by a human other than the recipient typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local mail directory is private but this is not guaranteed and can be overridden finally be aware that some mailing lists email addresses of everyone on a list are actually publicly accessable via mail routing software mechanisms this feature can be disabled most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly avoided with the use of strong end to end cryptography which has its own set of caveats for example unscrupulous administrators may still be a threat if the encryption site is shared or nonlocal see the sections on email privacy and email policies how am i not liable for my email and postings as punishment or whatever your system administrator can revoke certain privileges such as emailing usenet posting or reading certain groups file transferring remote communications or generally any subset of capabilities available from your account this all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator and under the procedures followed at a particular site which in many cases are haphazard and crisis oriented currently there are virtually no widespread uniform guidelines or procedures for restricting use to any internet services and local administrators are free to make arbitrary decisions on access today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations in the typical scenario complaint s reach a system adminstrator regarding abuses by a user usually but not necessarily preceded by complaints to the user in email regarding that person s objectionable email or postings abusive posters to usenet are usually first given admonitions from their system administrators as urged by others on the net the debate persists endlessly on many newsgroups whether this is also used as a questionable means of attacking or silencing harmless crackpots or censoring unpopular opinions system administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to squelch severe cases of abuse in general however by tradition usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of the system but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe their alternatives when this patience is sapped the options wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next message referred to as hitting the n key or to plonk annoying posters according to the hacker s dictionary the sound a jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file in cases where punitive actions are applied generally system administrators are least likely to restrict email usenet postings are much more commonly restricted either to individual users or entire groups such as a university campus restrictions are most commonly associated with the following abuses harassing or threatening notes email terrorism illegal uses e g piracy or propagation of copyrighted material ad hominem attacks i e insulting the reputation of the poster instead of citing the content of the message intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness inappropriate postings esp binary files in regular groups mail bombing inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive files major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and official email or postings most users have internet access via accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the internet can be construed as representative of their parent organizations many people put disclaimers in their signatures in an attempt dissociate their identity and activities from parent organizations as a precaution a recent visible political case involves the privacy of electronic mail written by white house staff members of the bush administration following are some guidelines acquaint yourself with your company or university policy if possible avoid use of your company email address for private communication use a disclaimer keep a low profile avoid flamewars or simply don t post avoid posting information that could be construed to be proprietary or internal the following references are available from ftp eff com see also the section on internet use policies pub academic banned pub academic banned computer material that was banned challenged in academia in and including usenet hierarchies pub academic cases this is an on line collection of information about specific computers and academic freedom cases file readme is a detailed description of the items in the directory pub academic faq netnews liability notes on university liability for usenet how do i provide more less information to others on my identity the public information of your identity and account is mostly available though the unix utility finger described above you have control over most of this information with the utility chfn the specifics vary between sites on some systems use passwd f you can provide unlimited information in the plan file which is copied directly to the destination during the fingering a technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is finger ing you and even to vary the plan file sent to them your signature is determined by the environment variable signature usenet signatures are conventionally stored in the signature file in your home directory providing less information on your online identity is more difficult and involved one approach is to ask your system adminstrator to change or delete information about you such as your full name you may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from someone unrelated to you personally you may be able to remotely login via modem or otherwise to computers that you are not physically near these are tactics for hiding or masking your online activities but nothing is foolproof consult man pages on the chmod command and the default file mode generally files on a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators to mask your identity in email or on usenet you can use different accounts more untraceable are new anonymous posting and remailing services that are very recently being established see below who is my sysadmin what does s he know about me the requirements and screening for getting a system administration job and thereby access to all information on a system vary widely between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax especially at universities many unix systems at universities are largely managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often hacking in general commercial and industrial sites are more strict on qualifications and background and government sites are extremely strict the system adminstrator root user can monitor what commands you used and at what times s he may have a record backups of files on your account over a few weeks s he can monitor when you send email or post usenet messages and potentially read either s he may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using both locally and elsewhere administrators sometimes employ specialized programs to track strange or unusual activity which can potentially be misused why is privacy un stable on the internet for the numerous reasons listed above privacy should not be an expectation with current use of the internet furthermore large parts of the internet are funded by the u s nsf national science foundation which places certain restrictions on its use such as prohibiting commercial use some high level officials in this and other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to guarantee privacy such as encryption and anonymous services historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been local perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread occurrences of university administrators refusing to carry some portion of usenet newsgroups labelled as pornographic the alternative hierarchy in the usenet system which has virtually no restrictions on propagation and new group creation is frequently targeted although this material may appear anywhere from the global point of view traffic is generally completely unimpeded on the internet and only the most egregious offenders are pursued for example verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted material such as newspaper or magazine articles are posted to usenet with regularity without major consequences some email complaints may ensue more astonishing to some is that currently significant portions of usenet traffic and less so internet traffic is comprised of sexually explicit digitized images almost entirely originating from copyrighted material newsgroups such as alt sex regularly have the highest traffic what is the future of privacy on the internet some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or appropriate level of privacy others will argue that as a prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate safeguards the internet is growing to become a completely global international superhighway for data and this traffic will inevitably entail data such as voice messages postal mail and many other items of extremely personal nature computer items that many people consider completely private such as their local hard drives will literally be inches from global network connections also sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with the internet most would agree that for these basic but sensitive uses of the internet no significant mechanisms are currently in place to ensure much privacy new standards are calling for uniform introduction of privacy enhanced mail pem which uses encryption technologies to ensure privacy so that privacy protection is automatic and may significantly improve safeguards the same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy such as with surreptitious surveilance can be overwhelmingly effective in protecting it e g with encryption some government agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general and believe that it should lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct e g court authorized wiretapping however powerful new technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming increasingly popular provoking some to say that the cat is out of the bag and the genie can t be put back in the bottle in less idiomatic terms they believe that the spread of strong cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically unstoppable to date no feasible system that guarantees both secure communication and government oversight has been proposed the two goals are largely incompatible proposals for registration of secret keys by d denning on sci crypt for example have been met with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections of inherent feasibility electronic privacy issues and particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet will foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few years anonymity what is anonymity on the internet simply stated anonymity is the absence of identity the ultimate in privacy however there are several variations on this simple theme a person may wish to be consistently identified by a certain pseudonym or handle and establish a reputation under it in some area providing pseudo anonymity a person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single one way message a sort of hit and run or a person may wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with others with either known or anonymous identities via an anonymous return address a user may wish to appear as a regular user but actually be untraceable sometimes a user wishes to hide who he is sending mail to in addition to the message itself the anonymous item itself may be directed at individuals or groups a user may wish to access some service and hide all signs of the association all of these uses are feasible on the internet but are currently tricky to carry out in practice because of all the tracking mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols officials of the nsf and other government agencies may be opposed to any of these uses because of the potential for abuse nevertheless the inherent facelessness of large networks will always guarantee a certain element of anonymity why is anonymity un important on the internet anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or problematic depending on its use arguably absence of identification is important as the presence of it it may be the case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted because true anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish one can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague that would sabotage a relationship if stated openly such as employer employee scenarios one can use it to pass information and evade any threat of direct retribution for example whistleblowers reporting on government abuses economic social or political can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or retaliation sensitive personal potentially damaging information is often posted to some usenet groups a risky situation where anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely independent of the identities of the participants some police departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of crimes such uses would be straightforward on the network unfortunately extortion and harassment become more insidious with assurances of anonymity how can anonymity be protected on the internet the chief means as alluded to above are masking identities in email and posting however anonymous accounts public accounts as accessable and anonymous as e g public telephones may be effective as well but this use is generally not officially supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and nsf guidelines the nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to anonymity virtually every protocol in existence currently contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet new communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication what is anonymous mail one approach to anonymizing mail has been to set up an anonymous server that when activated by email to its address responds by allocating and supplying an anonymous id that is unique to the person requesting it based on his email address this will vary for the same person for different machine address email originations to send anonymous mail the user sends email directed to the server containing the final destination the server anonymizes the message by stripping of identification information and forwards the message which appears to originate from the anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id this is the interactive use of anonymity or pseudonymity mentioned above another more fringe approach is to run a cypherpunk remailer from a regular user account no root system privileges are required these are currently being pioneered by eric hughes and hal finney hal alumni caltech edu the operator runs a process on a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail typically fields in the header one has been implemented as a perl script running on unix several of these are in existence currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge the remailers don t generally support anonymous return addresses mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system although actually may be held liable regardless these approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses the anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of anonymous id s to real addresses that must be maintained indefinitely one alternative is to allow deallocation of aliases at the request of the user but this has not been implemented yet although an unlikely scenario traffic to any of these sites could conceivably be monitored from the outside necessitating the use of cryptography for basic protection local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or under pressure from local network or government agencies unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic that goes through them most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected the cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these operators are basically network users who do not own the equipment and are accountable to their own system administrators who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered regarding it as illicit use in all cases a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous server operator by the user currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using smtp protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary field information this practice not uncommon to hackers and the approach used by remailers is generally viewed with hostility by most system administrators information in the header routing data and logs of network port connection information may be retained that can be used to track the originating site in practice this is generally infeasible and rarely carried out some administrators on the network will contact local administrators to request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished more severely such as revoking the account all of this actually happening occasionally but infrequently see the sections known anonymous mail and posting sites and responsibilities associated with anonymity what is anonymous posting anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous usenet posting with all the associated caveats above monitored traffic capricious or risky local circumstances logging make sure to test the system at least once by e g anonymous posting to misc test however some operators don t recommend this because many sites autorespond to test messages possibly causing the anonymous server to allocate anonymous ids for those machines see the responsibilties associated with anonymous posting before proceeding another direct route involves using nntp protocols to submit a message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information this practice not uncommon to hackers is also generally viewed with hostility by most system administrators and similar consequences can ensue see the sections known anonymous mail and posting sites and responsibilities associated with anonymity why is anonymity un stable on the internet as noted many factors compromise the anonymity currently available to the general internet community and these services should be used with great caution to summarize the technology is in its infancy and current approaches are unrefined unreliable and not completely trustworthy no standards have been established and troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software are prevalent here are some encountered and potential bugs one anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous return addresses others passed signature information embedded in messages unaltered address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced to a remailer are common forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem possibly allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon id email address mappings in the alias file this can be remedied with the use of passwords infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers source code is being distributed tested and refined for these systems but standards are progressing slowly and weakly the field is not likely to improve considerably without official endorsement and action by network agencies the whole idea is essentially still in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and distrust by many on the internet seen as illegitimate or favorable to criminality the major objection to anonymity over regular internet use is the perceived lack of accountability to system operators i e invulnerability to account restrictions resulting from outside complaints system adminstrators at some sites have threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the prominent servers from their redistribution flows this may only have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less characteristically detectable headers probably the least problematic approach and the most traditional to usenet is for individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer e g ignoring it or filtering it with kill files what is the future of anonymity on the internet new anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase safeguards of anonymity for example the same mechanism that routes email over multiple hosts thereby threatening its privacy can also be used to guarantee it in a scheme called chaining an anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers before reaching a destination in this way generally multiple links of the chain have to be broken for security to be compromised re encryption at each link makes this scenario even more unlikely even more significantly the anonymous remailers could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message tracing however remailers run by corrupt operators are possible the future of anonymous services on the internet is at this time highly uncertain and fraught with peril while specific groups seem to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities many feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in serious groups the introduction of unlimited group anonymity may have fundamental repercussions on usenet conventions and distribution mechanisms such as moderated and alt groups have had in the past for example as part of new group creation the charter may specify whether anonymous posting is un welcome nevertheless the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may be inevitable based on traffic statistics anonymous services are in huge demand pervasive and readily available anonymity could carry significant and unforeseen social consequences however if its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may be confined to the underground the ramifications of widespread introduction of anonymity to usenet are still largely unknown it is unclear whether it will provoke signficant amounts of new traffic or instead of expansion cause a shift where a greater portion of existing traffic is anonymized conceivably the services could play a role in influencing future mainstream social acceptance of usenet this is part of the privacy anonymity

many on their meaning especially on the internet in the general news media in the past a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends such as breaking into systems has been referred to as a hacker but most internet users prefer the term cracker for this instead a hacker is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious curious and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a system for example something of a proud electronic pioneer and patriot this is the sense intended in this document see also the hacker s dictionary and the faq alt security faq what is a cypherpunk from the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were more of it cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy must create it for themselves and not expect governments corporations or other large faceless organizations to grant them privacy out of beneficence cypherpunks know that people have been creating their own privacy for

mailing list below see also the cryptoanarchist manifesto and the cryptography glossary in soda berkeley edu pub cypherpunks what is steganography and anonymous pools closely associated with encryption is steganography or the techniques for not only pursuing private encrypted communication but concealing the very existence of the communication itself many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the proliferation of computer technology for example it is possible to encode messages in the least significant bits of images typically the most noisy in addition when such an item is posted in a public place such as a newsgroup virtually untraceable communication can take place between sender and receiver for steganographic communications in the electronic realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual users decode particular messages with their unique key an anonymous pool has

what is security through obscurity security through obscurity refers to the attempt to gain protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information or programs relating to them for example a company may not make public information on its software s encryption techniques to evade attacks based on knowledge of it another example would be concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in operating systems or some reliance may be made on the fact that some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious because they are not widely known or not widely used this argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and usenet posting forgery security through obscurity is regarded as a very feeble technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at worst also called the head in the sand approach see the faq for alt security some remarks of john perry barlow cofounder of the electronic frontier foundation directed to nsa agents at the first international symposium on national security national competitiveness held in mclean virginia dec digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep contained this stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile it s almost a life form in its ability to self propagate if something hits the net and it s something which people on there find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind i believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into an environment where any information which is at all interesting to people is going to get out and there will be very little that you can do about it this is not a bad thing in my view but you may differ what are identity daemons rfc describes a protocol standard that allows unix programs to query a remote user s login name after connection to a local communication socket a connection of this type is established during ftp and telnet sessions for example the standard is not widely supported perhaps of internet sites currently implement it but

frontier foundation eff from ftp eff org pub eff mission statement a new world is arising in the vast web of digital electronic media which connect us computer based communication media like electronic mail and computer conferencing are becoming the basis of new forms of community these communities without a single fixed geographical location comprise the first settlements on an electronic frontier while well established legal principles and cultural norms give structure and coherence to uses of conventional media like newspapers books and telephones the new digital media do not so easily fit into existing frameworks conflicts come about as the law struggles to define its application in a context where fundamental notions of speech property and place take profoundly new forms people sense both the promise and the threat inherent in new computer and communications technologies even as they struggle to master or simply cope with them in the workplace and the home the electronic frontier foundation has been established to help civilize the electronic frontier to make it truly useful and beneficial not just to a technical elite but to everyone and to do this in a way which is in keeping with our society s highest traditions of the free and open flow of information and communication eff was started by the multimillionaire mitchell kapor founder of lotus

operation sundevil and the steve jackson game case in the early s a fear spread among u s law enforcement agencies on the illicit activities of hackers and phreakers involved in such activities as credit card fraud and long distance call thievery see ftp eff org pub sjg general information effector operation sundevil the phoenix inspired crackdown of may concentrated on telephone code fraud and credit card abuse and followed this seizure plan with some success bulletin board systems went down all over america terrifying the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of their criminal instruments it also saddled analysts with some floppy disks and confronted harried justice department prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide hacker show trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of jurisdictions massive show trials never materialized although isolated instances of prosecution were pursued the movement reached a crescendo in texas with the highly publicized case of illegal search and seizure involving the steve jackson games company of austin texas on march from the column gurps labour lost by bruce sterling bruces well sf ca us in fantasy and science fiction magazine in an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional warrant agents of the secret service conducted a search of the sjg office when they left they took a manuscript being prepared for publication private electronic mail and several computers including the hardware and software of the sjg computer bulletin board system yet jackson and his business were not only innocent of any crime but never suspects in the first place the raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that somewhere in jackson s office there might be a document compromising the security of the telephone system fbi agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed on behalf of steve jackson games by the electronic frontier foundation see information on eff below from an article by joe abernathy in the houston chronicle feb austin an electronic civil rights case against the secret service closed thursday with a clear statement by federal district judge sam sparks that the service failed to conduct a proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown and went too far in retaining custody of seized equipment secret service special agent timothy foley of chicago who was in charge of three austin computer search and seizures on march that led to the lawsuit stoically endured spark s rebuke over the service s poor investigation and abusive computer seizure policies while the service has seized dozens of computers since the crackdown began in this is the first case to challenge the practice sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the austin science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never suspected of a crime and that agents did not do even marginal research to establish a criminal connection between the firm and the suspected illegal activities of an employee or to determine that the company was a publisher indeed agents testified that they were not even trained in the privacy protection act at the special secret service school on computer crime how long would it have taken you mr foley to find out what steve jackson games did what it was asked sparks an hour was there any reason why on march you could not return to steve jackson games a copy in floppy disk form of everything taken did you read the article in business week magazine where it had a picture of steve jackson a law abiding tax paying citizen saying he was a computer crime suspect did it ever occur to you mr foley that seizing this material could harm steve jackson economically foley replied no sir but the judge offered his own answer you actually did you just had no idea anybody would actually go out and hire a lawyer and sue you more than has been spent by the electronic frontier foundation in

intercept wire and electronic communications when authorized by law from bbs legislative watch fbis wiretapping proposal thwarted by s steele in boardwatch magazine feb p in a move that worried privacy experts software manufacturers and telephone companies the fbi proposed legislation to amend the communications act of to make it easier for the bureau to perform electronic wiretapping the proposed legislation entitled digital telephony would have required communications service providers and hardware manufacturers to make their systems tappable by providing back doors through which law enforcement officers could intercept communications furthermore this capability would have been provided undetectably while the communications was in progress exclusive of any communications between other parties regardless of the mobility of the target of the fbi s investigation and without degradation of service under the proposal the department of justice doj can keep communications products off the market if it determines that these products do not meet the doj s own guidelines this could result in increased costs and reduced competitiveness for service providers and equipment manufacturers since they will be unlikely to add any features that may result in a doj rejection of their entire product the fbi proposal suggests that the cost of this wiretapping service to the bureau would have to be borne by the service provider itself the electronic frontier foundation organized a broad coalition of public interest and industry groups from computer professionals for social responsibilty cpsr and the aclu to at t and sun microsystems to oppose the legislation a white paper produced by the eff and ratified by the coalition entitled an analysis of the fbi digital

person it s up to you to learn how to speak english properly and make whatever use you please of it though the government provides certain subsidies to help you learn to read and write a bit otherwise everybody just sort of pitches in and somehow the thing evolves on its own and somehow turns out workable and interesting fascinating even though a lot of people earn their living from using and exploiting and teaching english english as an institution is public property a public good much the same goes for the internet would english be improved if the the english language inc had a board of

anonymous remailing and posting sites what are the responsibilities associated with anonymity how do i kill anonymous postings what is the history behind anonymous posting servers what is the value of anonymity should anonymous posting to all groups be allowed what should system operators do with anonymous postings what is going on with anon penet fi maintained by j helsingius what are some known anonymous remailing and posting sites currently the most stable of anonymous remailing and posting sites is anon penet fi operated by julf penet fi for several months who has system adminstrator privileges and owns the equipment including anonymized mail usenet posting and return addresses no encryption send mail to help penet fi for information hal finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk remailers on the ftp site soda berkeley edu pub cypherpunks hal s instructions see also scripts tar z unix scripts to aid remailer use and anonmail arj msdos batch files to

remailers tend to be unstable because they are often running without site administrator knowledge liability issues are wholly unresolved so far all encryption is based on public key cryptography and pgp software see the question on cryptography encryption aspects message text destination address replies vary between sites multiple chaining alias unlinking and address encryption are mostly untested problematic or unsupported at this time what are the responsibilities associated with anonymity users use anonymity only if you have to frivolous uses weaken the seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others do not use anonymity to provoke harass or threaten others do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on usenet such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups if posting large files be attentive to bandwidth considerations remember simply sending the posting to the service increases network traffic avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of usenet this is the mostly likely place to alienate readers the alt hierarchy is preferred give as much information as possible in the posting i e references etc remember that content is the only means for readers to judge the truth of the message and that any inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even future ones under the same handle be careful not to include information that will reveal your identity or enable someone to deduce it test the system by sending anonymized mail to yourself be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege be considerate and respectful of other s objections to anonymity hit and run anonymity should be used with utmost reservation use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead be courteous to the system operator who may have invested large amounts of time be personally risking his account or dedicating his hardware all for your convenience operators document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an introductory file that is sent to new users have a coherent and consistent policy and stick to it state clearly what logging and monitoring is occurring describe your background interest and security measures will the general approach be totalitarian or lassaiz faire formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas what if a user is blackmailing someone through your service what if a user posts suicidal messages through your service remember your users trust you to protect them in the site introductory note give clear examples of situations where you will take action and what these actions will be e g warn the user limit anonymity to email or posting only revoke the account out the user contact local administrator etc describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware address the bandwidth limitations of your site report candidly and thoroughly all bugs that have occurred work closely with users to isolate and fix bugs address all bugs noted below under in stability of anonymity document the stability of the site how long has it been running what compromises have occured why are you running it what is your commitment to it include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages include an address for complaints ideally appended to every outgoing item consult a lawyer about your liability be committed to the long term stability of the site be prepared to deal with complaints and hate mail addressed to you if you do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system adminstrator consult those who do and are be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups if possible query group readers keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message format that can be screened effectively by kill files ensure the key text anon is somewhere in every header take precautions to ensure the security of the server from physical and network based attacks and infiltrations readers do not complain attack or discredit a poster for the sole reason that he is posting anonymously make blanket condemnations that equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality or assail anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons e g its volume is heavy or increasing react to the anonymous information unemotionally abusive posters will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate responses sometimes the most effective response is silence notify operators if very severe abuses occur such as piracy harassment extortion etc do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they offend you personally use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the idea of anonymity itself avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings should be barred from particular groups because no possible or conceivable need exists references see e g ftp eff org pub academic anonymity this article is an excerpt from an issue of fidonews on individual privacy and the use of handles it accepts the need of a system operator to know the name of a user but suggests that the use of a handle is analogous to a request to withhold the name in a letter to the editor the article concludes with a set of guidelines for preserving the right to be anonymous how do i kill anonymous postings james thomas green jgreen zeus calpoly edu try putting this in your kill file anon h j anonymous h j this will search the headers of the messages and kill any that contain anon or anonymous in them not perfect and won t kill followups note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask anonymous postings under which the above method will not work so far this practice is not widespread but it may become more common as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering what is the history behind anonymous posting servers originally anonymous posting services were introduced for individual particularly volatile newsgroups where anonymity is almost the preferred method of communication such as talk abortion and alt sex bondage one of the first was one by dave mack started in for alt sex bondage another early one was wizvax methuen ma us run by stephanie gilgut gilgut enterprises but was disbanded due to lack of funds the system provided anonymous return addresses n kbt rain com john opalko took up the functions of this server including reinstating the anonymous alias file the group alt personals has been chewing through servers like there s no tomorrow spurred by the disappearance of wizvax and interested in researching the idea karl kleinpaste karl kleinpaste godiva nectar cs cmu edu developed his own system from scratch in six hours by this time the idea of extending the server to new more mainstream groups was starting to emerge and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request by multiple users for anonymity in other groups the intended advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group support with a single anon identifier across all this was arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems k kleinpaste posted a message on rec nude asking users whether an anonymous service would be welcome there and judged a consensus against it k kleinpaste introduced what he calls a fire extinguisher to squelch or plonk abusive users in response to complaints and used this in three cases nevertheless after a few months of intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his server even as restricted as it was my system was subjected to abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the facilities staff here such abuses started right after it was created in nov johan helsingius julf penet fi set up the most controversial anonymous site to date anon penet fi is based on scripts and c code written by k kleinpaste and supports anonymized mail posting and return addresses he initially wanted to confine the service to scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide accessability in response to lots of international requests j helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every usenet newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological opposition e g by news adminstrators in news admin policy because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium abuses by anonymous posters tend to have higher visibility than routine abuses his total commitment to preservation of anonymity is also controversial for example in a highly controversial and publicized case in feb an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate crew dialogue during the challenger shuttle disaster via anon penet fi to sci astro despite that the transcript had been posted in the same place up to a year earlier then non anonymously and actually originated not with the poster but a new york news tabloid subsequent responses consisted largely of vociferous outrage at the poster s use of anonymity reverberating through many newsgroups the original poster using the same anonymous handle later conceded that the story seemed likely to have been fabricated suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of the story albeit crudely free of personal risk from perceived association with the item the ensuing commotion generated queries for the original article by late entering readers the anonymous user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his detractors despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints and even the vocal opposition and verbal abuse of k kleinpaste and eminent news operators j helsingius has largely avoided use of the fire extingisher and the group bouncer mechanisms that limit the scope of the service as of march the anon penet fi site is best described as inundated it has registered over users in its initial three months of operation forwards messages a day and approximately of all usenet postings are anonymized through the site the immense popularity is probably largely due to the capability for global anonymity which has allowed users to find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned johan helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to dismantle his server in feb at one point k kleinpaste threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate news operators to send out revocation commands on all messages originating from the site j helsingius has also alluded to threats of flooding the server the server has crashed several times at least once due to a saturation mailbombing through it by an anonymous user mr helsingius reports spending up to hours per day answering email requests alone associated with the service s administration in response to the serious threats he disabled global group access temporarily for one week and encouraged his users to defend the service publicly based on fast moving dialogue and creative suggestions by cypherpunks j helsingius has identified many security weaknesses and valuable new features for the service and is currently in the process of code development and testing he is planning on upgrading the ibm compatible machine to a soon to handle the voluminous load and is considering integrating a new system with very sophisticated functionality including multiple email aliases alias allocation control public key encryption etc a very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in dec by d clunie dclunie pax tpa com au that used cryptography in both directions to from the server for the highest degree of confidentiality seen so far however it was running on a public access account and he had to shut it down after only several weeks upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately originating from nsf representatives d clunie has released the software to the public domain recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to whistleblowing on government abuses has received wide and focused attention and group formation is currently underway in the basic scenario the group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable digital signatures the traffic may eventually reach reporters in the mainstream news media deltorto aol com has volunteered to attack multiple aspects of this project including distributing easy to read documentation on posting anonymization and encryption see also sections on views on anonymous posting below and what is going on with anon penet fi in this document thanks to carl kleinpaste karl kleinpaste godiva nectar cs cmu edu david clunie dclunie pax tpa com au and johan helsingius julf penet fi for contributions here what is the value of anonymity kondared purccvm bitnet i think anonymous posts do help in focusing our attention on the content of one s message sure lot of anonymous posts are abusive or frivolous but in most cases these are by users who find the anon facility novel once the novelty wears off they are stopping their pranks morgan engr uky edu wes morgan i don t mind seeing the miscellaneous hatred prejudice racism those things are part of our nature however the notion of providing anonymity s shield for these ideas repulses me if they have such strong feelings why can t they put their name s on their postings quite frankly i loathe communication with people who refuse to use their names dclunie pax tpa com au david clunie many seem to question the value of anonymity but who are they to say what risks another individual should take there is no question that in this rather conservative society that we live in holding certain views making certain statements adopting a certain lifestyle are likely to result in public censure ridicule loss of status employment or even legal action given the heterogeneity of the legal jurisdictions from where the many contributors to usenet post who knows what is legal and what is not some say that anonymous posters are cowards and should stand up and be counted perhaps that is one point of view but what right do these detractors have to exercise such censorship from doug cc ysu edu doug sewell why is it censorship to not expect someone to speak for themselves without the cloak of anonymity this is at best a lame argument you tell me why what you have to say requires anonymity and you tell me why the wishes of a majority of non anonymous users of a newsgroup should be disregarded when they don t want anonymous posts anonymous users have less rights than any others they are not legitimate usenet participants i would not honor rfds cfvs control messages or votes from one brad clarinet com brad templeton i can think of no disadvantage caused by anon posting sites that doesn t already exist other than the fact that they do make more naive net users who don t know how to post anonymously the old way more prone to do it from mandel netcom com tom mandel i cannot speak for others but i regard anonymous postings in a serious discussion as pretty much worthless views that hide behind the veil of anon are hardly worth the trouble of reading n anon penet fi hank pankey since i began posting anonymously to show support for general principles of personal privacy i have been subject to far more abuse and attack than i ever received before people seem to find it easier to flame and insult someone whose name they don t know perhaps it s easier to pretend that there is no person behind the email address who feels the sting of abusive comments anonymity does hinder some methods of controlling other posters actions people who seek such control will naturally oppose it from acearl leo bsuvc bsu edu instead of making this a free er medium by allowing posters to protect themselves with anonymity simply require that all posters be prepared to discuss their sources of information and take the heat for unsubstantiated dribble this seems to be the way things are currently done xtkmg trentu ca kate gregory in misc kids there are three threads going on started by anonymous posters one was about changing jobs so as to work less hours job sharing and so on from a woman who didn t want anyone at her current place of work to know she was thinking of looking for work elsewhere the next was from a woman who is thinking of having a baby sometime soon and doesn t want coworkers friends family etc etc to know all about it but who wants advice the third is about sex after parenthood actually this was started by people posting in the usual way but then it was pointed out that the anonymous posting service might let more people participate misc kids doesn t seem to be suffering any harm from the presence of anonymous posters in fact it seems to have been helped by it hoey zogwarg etl army mil dan hoey while there has never been any real security against anonymous or forged postings on usenet the process has until now been sufficiently inconvenient error prone and undocumented to limit its use by persons who have not learned the culture of the net on the other hand a recent use of the anonymous posting service on sci math seemed seemed to be a student asking help on a homework problem it has now been attributed to a teacher asking for an explanation of a dubious answer in his teaching guide he says his news posting is broken so he is using the anonymous service as a mail to news gateway karl barrus elee sf menudo uh edu some argue that the opinions of the people who hide behind a veil of anonymity are worthless and that people should own up to their thoughts i agree with the latter point in an ideal world we would all be sitting around engaging in socratic dialogues freely exchanging our opinions in an effort to learn but in an ideal world nobody will threaten you for your thoughts or ridicule you but we live in a world where the people who don t agree with you may try to harm you let s face it some people aren t going to agree with your opinion no matter how logically you try to present it or how reasoned out it may be this is sad since it does restrict people from voicing their opinions red redpoll neoucom edu richard e depew the consensus seems to be that a general anonymous posting service such as that at anon penet fi seems sufficiently corrosive of the trust and civility of the net that this particular experiment should be ended perhaps the next time the question comes up we can say we tried it we learned it does more harm than good and we stopped it from c vm urz uni heidelberg de alexander eichener anonymous posting has not created major problems aside from angering irate people like you who would rather ban anonymous pseudonymous posting altogether because real men can stand up for what they said or comparable puerile arguments as others have brought up dave elxr jpl nasa gov dave hayes what a primal example of human nature i have three questions for you folks do people really say different things to each other based upon whether their identity is or isn t known are people really so affected by what other people say that the verbage is labeled abuse most importantly on a forum that prizes itself on the freedom of communication that it enjoys is there really such a thing as freedom of communication from terry geovision gvc com terry mcgonigal sigh just how many anon services are needed will everybody start running one soon what s the purpose who stands to benefit when there are n anon services then n then n out there where has this sudden fasination with anon services come from for better or imho worse it looks like we er gonna get stuck with these things and as much as i don t like the idea of services like this becoming the norm i don t really think there s much to be done since it s obvious that anyone who wants to can set one up with a bit of work karl kleinpaste cs cmu edu karl kleinpaste weak reasoning with freedom comes responsibility dave elxr jpl nasa gov dave hayes responsibility isn t real if it is enforced true responsibilty comes with no coercion should anonymous posting to all groups be allowed morgan engr uky edu wes morgan i will be the first to admit that i hold some controversial opinions indeed i m sure that none of us are completely orthodox in our opinions however i ve received hundreds of anonymous email messages over the last few years fewer than of them were reasonable posts made with good motives it s getting more and more difficult to remember why we need anonymity at all the abusers are once again lousing things up for those who truly need the service or those who would put it to good use i m not suggesting that we should ban anonymous servers as i ve said there are several situations in which anonymity is a good thing tm however the notion that anonymity s shield should be automatically extended to every usenet discussion is ridiculous it opens the door to further abuse twpierce unix amherst edu tim pierce of course how does one determine whether a group requests the service a flat majority of posters voting in favor a positive margin of votes or what no one speaks for a newsgroup i m not convinced by the arguments that an anonymous posting service for all newsgroups is inherently a bad idea simply because it s a diversion from the status quo since the status quo previously permitted anonymous posting to no newsgroups any anonymous posting service would reject the status quo hartman ulogic uucp richard m hartman writes it is facist to suggest that a newsgroup is best able to decide whether it wants to allow anonymous postings instead of having them forced upon them by an service administrator ogil quads uchicago edu brian w ogilvie the service provides a mechanism for forwarding mail to the original poster since most usenet readers don t know john smith from jane doe except by their opinions and their address the effect of having an anonymous posting to which mail replies can be directed is minimal except for those who personally know the poster and the lack of anonymity could be serious any mechanism like this is liable to abuse but the benefits as well as the costs must be weighed limiting the service to alt groups or specific groups would not help those who want advice on sensitive issues in more professional newsgroups from tarl sw stratus com tarl neustaedter an additional point is that some of us find anonimity in technical matters to be profoundly offensive anonimity in different forums has different meanings if i get a phone call from someone who won t identify himself i hang up if i get u s mail with no return address it goes into the garbage unopened if someone accosts me in the street while wearing a mask i back away carefully and expecting violence in a technical discussion anonimity means that the individual isn t willing to associate himself with the matter being discussed which discredits his utterances and makes listening to them a waste of time anonimity leads to fun psych experiments the literature is filled with all the various things that people will do anonymously that they won t otherwise including one notorious study involving torture that would not have passed today s ethical standards fun stuff in any case fine leave us out of it from jbuck forney berkeley edu joe buck you obviously have never submitted an article to a refereed journal where you will receive anonymous reviews through a server the editor that behaves much like the one in finland e g you may reply and the editor will maintain the anonymity your comparison of someone who wants to express him herself on a technical issue anonymously with a person who approaches you on a dark street with a ski mask is just emotionally overwrought nonsense such posters pose no physical threat to you jik mit edu j kamens it seems obvious to me that the default should be not to allow anonymous postings in a newsgroup the usenet has always operated on the principle that the status quo should be kept unless there s a large number of people who want to change it if someone really needs to post a message anonymous in a newsgroup in which this usually isn t done they can usually find someone on the net to do this for them they don t need an automated service to do it and the automated service is by its nature incapable of making the judgment call necessary to decide whether a particular posting really needs to be anonymous from twpierce unix amherst edu tim pierce for any newsgroup you name i bet i can envision a scenario involving a need for secrecy if an accurate content based filter of each anonymous posting could be devised to screen out those that don t require secrecy wonderful but it can t be done from lhp daimi aau dk lasse hiller e petersen if a newsgroup wants to be noise and nuisance free then it should call for moderation this should happen on a per newsgroup basis and not as a general usenet ban on anonymous postings of course one principle of moderation might be to keep out all anonymous postings and could be achieved automatically it would still be moderation personally i would prefer moderation criteria being based on actual content david a clunie dclunie pax tpa com au if a group doesn t want to receive certain posts it should become moderated there are clearly defined mechanisms on non alt groups for this to take place an automated moderator excluding posts from certain eg anonymous sites or individuals could easily be established if anyone wants to take such a draconian approach then they are welcome to do so and good luck to them i doubt if i will be reading their group from dave frackit uucp dave ratcliffe what possible need would someone have for posting anonymously to a sci group sure most adults are willing to post under their own names why would they want to hide behind an anonymous posting service ashamed of what they have to say or just trying to rile people without fear of being identified anonymous posting have their place in certain groups if i or anyone else needs to tell you what those groups are then you ve been on another planet breathing exotic gases for too long from karl kleinpaste cs cmu edu it s bloody fascinating that all the proponents of unimpeded universal anon posting access can t seem to find any middle ground at all why is there such a perception of absolutism where does this instant gratification syndrome come from i want anon access and i want it now who are the control freaks here from acearl leo bsuvc bsu edu remember this is a newsgroup for posters writing about scientific issues anonymous discussion of scientific issues leads to bad science from noring netcom com jon noring though many have personal philosophical arguments against anonymous posters their arguments have not been compelling enough to convince me that omni newsgroup anonymous posting should be banned or severely restricted though i cannot prove it it seems to me that those who do not like anonymous posting in principle do so for reasons that are personal read psychological discomfort rather than for reasons related to maintaining the integrity of usenet remember it is impossible to be able to ascertain all the conceivable and legitimate motives for anonymous posting to newsgroups one normally would not deem to be sensitive in general i fear even letting newsgroup readers vote on either allowing or not allowing anonymous posting since a priori they cannot know all the motives of legitimate posters and i do not believe that any system should ever be instituted that would inhibit the posting of legitimate and informative posts lestat wixer cactus org lyle j mackey writes i personally don t believe that pseudonymous postings are appropriate in a serious discussion area if there is a legitimate reason for concealing the posters identity perhaps but simply because they re not so sure if they want their name attached doesn t qualify as legitimate in my book oh and if you can come up with a legitimate purpose for anonymous postings please enlighten me sderby crick ssctr bcm tmc edu stuart p derby three of our the u s s founding fathers madison hamilton and jay seemed to think anonymous posting was ok the federalist papers were originally printed in new york newspapers with authorship attributed to publius i wonder if you would find their purpose legitimate what should system operators do with anonymous postings from emcguire intellection com ed mcguire i would like to know how to junk all articles posted by the anonymous service currently being discussed ideally i would actually tell my feed site not to feed me articles posted by the anonymous service assuming the c news performance release what is a simple way to accomplish this or where should i look to learn how to do it myself from dclunie pax tpa com au david clunie that s a bit draconian isn t it have your users unanimously decided that they would like you to do this or have you decided for them from emcguire intellection com ed mcguire good question nobody has decided i have no definite plan to do this just wanted the technical data carl kleinpaste karl kleinpaste godiva nectar cs cmu edu were i to be in the position of offering such a service again my promises of protection of anonymity would be limited not on the basis of personal opinion of what gets posted but on the basis of postings which disrupt the smooth operation of the usenet the most obvious and direct recourse would be to out the abusive individual less drastic possibilities exist the software supports a fire extinguisher by which individuals can be prevented from posting john iastate edu john hascall since when is usenet a democracy if someone wants to run an anonymous service that s their business if you want to put that host in your killfile that s your business if a newsadmin wants to blanket drop all postings from that site that s between them and the other people at that site if everyone ignores a service the service effectively doesn t exist from jik athena mit edu jonathan i kamens nntp servers that allow posting from anyone are not a service to the net they do the net a disservice terminal servers have the same problems as open nntp servers they allow people who want to do illegal immoral unethical things on the internet to do so without accountability there are by now public access sites all over this country if not all over the world that allow very inexpensive access to the usenet and the internet there is no reason for nntp servers to allow anyone to post messages through them and there is no reason for terminal servers to allow anyone to connect to them and then make outbound connections through them perhaps when it was harder to get to the internet or the usenet open servers could be justified but not now jbotz mtholyoke edu jurgen botz i think that what these points show clearly is that an anonymous posting service has a great deal of responsibility both towards its clients and towards the net as a whole such a service should imho have a set of well defined rules and a contract that its clients should sign under the terms of which they are assured anonymity from an anon penet fi is the problem that some are used to punishing posters who are upsetting in some vague way by complaining to the usually acquiescent sysadmin or organizations that the poster belongs to that surely is the most gutless approach to solving problems but my experience on the net shows that the same users who vilify anonymous postings are the first to write obsessively detailed grievances to the poster s supervisor when his or her tranquility is disturbed by some intrusive or subversive post or another anonymous postings prevent just this kind of intimidation from gandalf cyberspace org eric schilling the main point i would like to make here is that while we can go through and revise the news sw to reject anon posts to technical newsgroups or some such thing i think the attempt will prove futile each attempt to modify news can result in a changed approach by anon service providers to thwart the change i think this would be pointless from julf penet fi johan helsingius i have tried to stay out of this discussion and see where the discussion leads but now i rally feel like i have to speak up i have repeatedly made clear that i do block users if they continue their abuse after having been warned in many cases the users have taken heed of the warning and stopped and in some cases even apologized in public and when the warning has not had the desired effect i have blocked a number of users i have also blocked access to groups where the readership has taken a vote to ban anonymous postings although i feel changing the newsgroup status to moderated is the only permanent solution for newsgroups that want to formalize discussion red redpoll neoucom edu richard e depew does this mean that you are volunteering to issue a request for discussion to ban anonymous postings or to moderate each of the newsgroups that your server can reach i don t think so but this illustrates the trouble that your server is causing please listen to the consensus of the news administrators in this group any newsgroup should be consulted before letting your server post messages to that group from c vm urz uni heidelberg de alexander eichener there is no pompous consensus of the news administrators here maybe you would like to invent one there is a sizeable number of people who are concerned about the possible and to a minor extent about the actual abuse of the server as it is configured now these concerns are respectable johan is dealing with them there are some few who rage with foam before their mouth and condemn the service altogether and a number who defend it pointing out like kate gregory that even a group like misc kids can benefit from pseudonymous postings from julf penet fi johan helsingius i have answered a lot of personal mail related to server abuse and as a result of that blocked a number of abusive users i have also withdrawn the service from several newsgroups where the users have taken a vote on the issue i have not made any comments on news admin policy partly because the newly implemented password feature as a emergency measure against a security hole has kept me really busy answering user queries the last two weeks and partly because i feel it is not for me to justify the service but for the users the problem with news admin policy is that the readership is rather elective representing people whith a strong interest in centralised control from hartman ulogic uucp richard m hartman this seems to be a rather bigoted attitude i would consider that this group is for anyone who wishes to discuss how the net should be controlled saying that we only have an interest in centralized control is a clear indication of bias you are perfectly welcome to join in the discussions here to promote your views on control jbuck ohm berkeley edu this whole debate is a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing because even if you all decide to ban anonymous posting servers it is not enforceable the only people who conceivably could enforce retrictions are those that control the international links policy changes should be made by cooperation not by attempting to dictate you need to persuade those who run the services to act like this through friendly persuasion not by trying to beat them over the head with a stick especially a stick you don t even have spp zabriskie berkeley edu steve pope i am finding this bias against pseudonymity boring our friend posting through penet has a point the old guard would like to keep their network the way it always has been and this new thing these pseudonymous servers cuts into their turf so they whine and bitch about it and every time there s the slightest abuse such as somebody s sig being too long they try to parlay that into an argument against pseudonymity i ll go on record as saying three cheers for the admins at anon servers like penet pax and n kbt and for all the access service providers who are willing to preserve their clients privacy and a pox on those who try to defeat and restrict pseudonymity mimir stein u washington edu al billings i wouldn t help people get rid of anon postings as a group if you don t like what someone says then you put that anon address in your kill file not all of them of course if and when i get an anon site going i m just going to assign fake names like jsmith instead of anon to avoid most of the hassles you ll never know it is anonymous will you from anne alcor concordia ca anne bennett i must admit to some astonishment at this argument i see the value of anonymous postings under some circumstances yet believe strongly that these should be identified as such so that people who do not wish to read material from people who won t identify themselves don t have to i fail to see what good you would be accomplishing and indeed surmise that you will cause many people inconvenience and annoyance by hiding the anonymity of postings from your anonymous site would you care to justify where the hell you get the gall to try to prevent people from effectively filtering their news as they see fit from dclunie pax tpa com au david clunie i thought i was out of reach here in australia too unfortunately one of the us sites involved in the us aus feed complained to the australian academic reasearch network through whom my site is connected not about anything in particular just the concept of anonymous mail having no redeeming features and consuming a narrow bandwidth link with which i can t argue and that was that stop the service or face disconnection i consider the demise of my service to have been rather unfortunate and i wish the finnish remailer luck it is a pity that there are very few if any similar services provided with in the us i guess that s the benefit of having a constitution that guarantees one freedom of speech and a legal and political system that conspires to subvert it in the name of the public good what is going on with anon penet fi run by j helsingius from karl kleinpaste cs cmu edu funny how beating the rest of the usenet over the head with a stick is ok if it s anon penet fi and universal anon access but somehow people on the other side of the same equation not even arguing to shut it off entirely but rather just to have some control applied to the abuses that manifest themselves aren t allowed to do that i have written to johan several times in the last couple of weeks he used to reply to me quite readily after all i was the source of the software as originally delivered to him he used to be downright prompt about replying to me funny now he s being an impolite bastard who doesn t answer mail at all even when it consists of really very civil queries from julf penet fi johan helsingius in your mail you told me you sent me one or more messages on feb th feb th and th the server was down and the flood of mail that resulted from the server coming up again crashed my own mail host the problem was aggregated by an abusive user sending thousands of messages to another user filling up that users mailbox the bounce messages ended up in my mailbox overflowing my local disk as well i can only suppose that your message got lost in that hassle as i have tried to answer as much as possible of the anon related messages i get from routine mis addessed messages to complaints about the service on the average i spend hours per day answering anon related messages from karl kleinpaste cs cmu edu why is it that everybody else has to put up with the impoliteness and insensitivity of the misuse of anon penet fi whose definitions of polite and sense apply and why why is universal anon access considered to be within the realm of this fuzzy concept of politeness in the first place i think johan has long since crossed the line into being a rude bastard and i told him so in private mail a little while ago at this point i deeply regret a having created an anonymous system supporting newsgroup and b having given the code to johan i didn t copyright it but i thought that some concept of politeness and good sense might follow it to new homes interesting that johan s ideas of politeness and good sense seem to have nearly no interesection with mine i could even cope with universal anon access if johan would be willing to engage in abuse control but somehow that seems to be outside the range of reality from julf penet fi johan helsingius there is no way for me to convey how sad and upset your message made me i do to some extent understand your feelings but it still feels really bad running the server requires getting used to a lot of flames but mindlessly abusive hate mail is so much easier to deal with than something like this as i do respect and value your views and opinions to a high degree no i m not asking for sympathy i just wanted you to know that i am really giving your views quite a lot of weight when i asked for the software i was actually only going to provide the service to scandinavian users but a lot of people requested that i keep the service open to the international community i now realize that i ought to have contacted you at that point to ask how you feel about me using your stuff in such a context again i really want to apologise and i will replace the remaining few pieces of code thet still stem from your system unfortunately there is no way to remove the ideas and structure i got from you again i am really sorry that the results of your work ended up being used in a way that you don t approve of and i will be giving a lot of hard thought to the possibility of shutting down the server alltogether from karl kleinpaste cs cmu edu i think i m feeling especially rude and impolite if it s good for johan it s good for me after all he didn t ask the greater usenet whether universal anon access was a good idea he just did it yes i m a seriously rude pain in the ass now and i think i ll arm the usenet death penalty slightly modified not for strategic whole site attack but tactical assault just an anon penet fi destruction only outside alt too let s say to parrot this line people have been doing things like the udp that is cancelling others postings for years no one could ever stop them and it s only politeness and good sense that has prevented them up to now in fact i have people who have expressed privately the desire and ability to arm the udp ps no in fact there are not newsadmins ready to arm the udp it would be amusing to know how many people gulped hard when they read that though i don t see it as any different from johan s configuration pps now that i ve calmed some fears by the above ps there are newsadmins ready to arm the udp they ve asked for my code i haven t sent it yet only one site would be necessary to bring anon penet fi to a screeching halt anyone can implement the udp on their own if they care to politeness and good sense prevents them from doing so i wonder how long before one form of impoliteness brings on another form from julf penet fi johan helsingius it would be trivially easy to bring anon penet fi to a screeching halt in fact it has happened a couple of times already but as we are talking threats here let me make one as well a very simple one if somebody uses something like the udp or maliciously brings down anon penet fi by some other means it will stay down but i will let the users know why and name the person who did it ok as somebody said on this thread you have to take personal responsibility for your actions right from avs ccc amdahl com atul v salgaonkar i am very grateful and appreciative of this service courtesey of penet fi some important questions about my personal life career job were resolved due to kind help of other people who had been thru similar situations in return i have also replied to anon postings where i thought i could make a positive contribution in general anon service is a great in my opinion although like any tool some people will not use it responsibly i suggest that it should be kept alive wasting bandwidth is less important than saving lives i think from us mmm serc m com elisa j collins i have been informed that the anonymous posting service to many newsgroups has been turned off as a result of discussions in this newsgroup over people abusing it i had been posting to a nontechnical misc newsgroup about an intimate topic for which i felt i required privacy i have received immeasurable help from the people in that newsgroup and i have never used anonymity to behave in an abusive immature or unethical fashion toward anyone please folks believe me i need this service please consider

nist computer security bbs at the white house office of the press secretary for immediate release april statement by the press secretary the president today announced a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement the initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting americans rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer it is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files while encryption technology can help americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals a state of the art microcircuit called the clipper chip has been developed by government engineers the chip represents a new approach to encryption technology it can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone it scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today this new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically at the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals a key escrow system will be established to ensure that the clipper chip is used to protect the privacy of law abiding americans each device containing the chip will have two unique keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device when the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two key escrow data bases that will be established by the attorney general access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap the clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the attorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices in addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings the chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption s dual edge sword encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and terrorists we need the clipper chip and other approaches that can both provide law abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities in order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches like the key escrow system the president has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the national information infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of american industry in the global marketplace and the need of u s companies to manufacture and export high technology products the president has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries the congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed the administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a national information infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give americans unprecedented access to information this infrastructure of high speed networks information superhighways will transmit video images hdtv programming and huge data files as easily as today s telephone system transmits voice since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use the administration is committed to policies that protect all americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet the provisions of the president s directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available for additional details call mat heyman national institute of standards and technology questions and answers about the clinton administration s telecommunications initiative q does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations a no clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans q suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device what would they have to do to decipher the message a they would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers the key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system q who will run the key escrow data banks a the two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities at this point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key escrow data banks q how strong is the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security is a this system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today while the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities q whose decision was it to propose this product a the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agencies were involved in this decision this approach has been endorsed by the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet officials q who was consulted the congress industry a we have on going discussions with congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy we have briefed members of congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers a the government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them q who provides the clipper chip a mykotronx programs it at their facility in torrance california and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers the programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future q how do i buy one of these encryption devices a we expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the clipper chip into their devices q if the administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices a this is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review the key escrow mechanism will provide americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the administration is developing the administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have effectively done nor is the u s saying that every american as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product there is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either or proposition rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the clipper chip and similar encryption techniques q what does this decision indicate about how the clinton administration s policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration a it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public interest groups to find innovative ways to protect americans privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism q will the devices be exportable will other devices that use the government hardware a voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements case by case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices the same is true for other encryption devices one of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to u s companies operating at home and abroad with this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case by case basis for u s companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad we plan to review

federal government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement a nice formulation for the introduction of the first encryption devices with built in trapdoors just like the feds wanted for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting americans rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement bla bla protect electronic mail and computer files while encryption technology can help americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals indeed and the current proposal does nothing to prevent the latter an ordinary telephone it scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today this doesn t say much there are many incredibly weak encryption algorithms in commercial use today this new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically except from the government at the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals nope the criminals won t be stupid enough to use the new chip they ll use something secure this technology provides only means to intercept the phone conversations of people who are stupid enough to use it agencies to decode messages encoded by the device when the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two key escrow data bases that will be established by the attorney general access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap that is the government has the keys it doesn t matter much if they are in one or in two of its hands the clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans correct it does however provide those americans with the false sense of privacy devices in addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings if the screening is not public it cannot be trusted some people do not trust des even today after all the examinations only because some parts of its design were kept secret the chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption s dual edge sword encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and terrorists we need the clipper chip and other approaches that can both provide law abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities in order to assess technology so they ll use a different technology to hide their illegal activities so will those law abiding citizens who do not trust their government not to misuse its abilities to decrypt their conversations the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes except from the government the need of u s companies to manufacture and export high technology products huh later it says that the new technology will be export restricted since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use the administration is committed to policies that protect all americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law in short the new technology can protect the law abiding citizen s privacy from the casual snooper it cannot protect him from the government if it decides to misuse its ability to decrypt the conversations protect him from the criminals who succeed to break the new encryption scheme or to steal the keys or to bribe the people who handle them etc prevent the criminals from using secure encryption for communication q does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations a no clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans correct however it does not provide them that much privacy as it claims q who will run the key escrow data banks a the two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities at this point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key escrow data banks two candidates the nsa and the mafia q how strong is the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security is a this system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today that is trust us while the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow security through obscurity system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities if it s not entirely open to public examination it cannot be trusted besides who can prove that the devices used for examination and the ones built into your phones will be the same q whose decision was it to propose this product a the national security council the justice department the the nsa and the fbi q who was consulted the congress industry a we have on going discussions with congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy we have briefed members of congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative why did they forget the academia q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers a the government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them doesn t this smell to monopolism q who provides the clipper chip a mykotronx programs it at their facility in torrance california and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers the programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future like the mafia q if the administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices this is the main question why was it buried at the end a this is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review the key escrow we ll see mechanism will provide americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one trust us the administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have in short if we decide to outlaw strong crypto we ll tell you effectively done nor is the u s saying that every american as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product there is a since the us government seems to consider strong crypto as munitions and since the us constitutions guarantees the right to every american to bear arms why is not every american entitled as a matter of right to an unbreakable commercial encryption product a it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public interest groups to find innovative ways to protect americans privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism bullshit the proposed technology provides a false sense of security encryption devices with built in capabilities for breaking the encryption does not prevent the criminals to use strong crypto and is a step to outlaw strong crypto q will the devices be exportable will other devices that use the government hardware a voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements case by case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices the who was the optimist who believed that the new administration will leave the export controls on strong crypto devices ok i m not american it s not my business but i just couldn t resist to comment the whole plot looks so totalitaristic it s up to you americans to fight for your rights regards vesselin p s now is the time for david sternlight to pop

re text of white house announcement and q as on clipper chip encryption the key question is whether non clipper encryption will be made illegal the administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have effectively done nor is the u s saying that every american as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product there is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either or proposition rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the clipper chip and similar encryption techniques the clear middle ground implied by these statements is to say that americans have the right to clipper encryption but not to unbreakable encryption this implies that ultimately non clipper strong encryption must become illegal as an aside isn t the language here jarring all this talk about harmonious balance when they re talking about taking away people s right to communications privacy although the article emphasizes voice communication data and mail encryption is mentioned as well sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer it is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes it looks like the worst nightmares raised by dorothy denning s proposals are coming true if the government continues on this course i imagine that we will see strong cryptography made illegal encryption programs for disk files and email as well as software to allow for encrypted voice communications will be distributed only through the underground people will have to learn how to hide the fact that they are protecting their privacy it s shocking and frightening to see that this is actually happening here hal finney hal alumni caltech edu
the battle is joined it looks like dorothy denning s wrong headed ideas have gotten to the administration even sooner than we feared it s time to make sure they hear the other side of the story and hear it loudly phil forwarded message subject text of white house announcement and q as on clipper chip encryption note this file will also be available via anonymous file transfer from csrc ncsl nist gov in directory pub nistnews and via the nist computer security bbs at the white house office of the press secretary for immediate release april statement by the press secretary the president today announced a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement the initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting americans rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer it is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files while encryption technology can help americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals a state of the art microcircuit called the clipper chip has been developed by government engineers the chip represents a new approach to encryption technology it can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone it scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today this new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically at the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals a key escrow system will be established to ensure that the clipper chip is used to protect the privacy of law abiding americans each device containing the chip will have two unique keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device when the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two key escrow data bases that will be established by the attorney general access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap the clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the attorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices in addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings the chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption s dual edge sword encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and terrorists we need the clipper chip and other approaches that can both provide law abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities in order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches like the key escrow system the president has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the national information infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of american industry in the global marketplace and the need of u s companies to manufacture and export high technology products the president has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries the congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed the administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a national information infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give americans unprecedented access to information this infrastructure of high speed networks information superhighways will transmit video images hdtv programming and huge data files as easily as today s telephone system transmits voice since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use the administration is committed to policies that protect all americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet the provisions of the president s directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available for additional details call mat heyman national institute of standards and technology questions and answers about the clinton administration s telecommunications initiative q does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations a no clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans q suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device what would they have to do to decipher the message a they would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers the key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system q who will run the key escrow data banks a the two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities at this point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key escrow data banks q how strong is the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security is a this system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today while the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities q whose decision was it to propose this product a the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agencies were involved in this decision this approach has been endorsed by the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet officials q who was consulted the congress industry a we have on going discussions with congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy we have briefed members of congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers a the government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them q who provides the clipper chip a mykotronx programs it at their facility in torrance california and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers the programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future q how do i buy one of these encryption devices a we expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the clipper chip into their devices q if the administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices a this is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review the key escrow mechanism will provide americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the administration is developing the administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have effectively done nor is the u s saying that every american as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product there is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either or proposition rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the clipper chip and similar encryption techniques q what does this decision indicate about how the clinton administration s policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration a it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public interest groups to find innovative ways to protect americans privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism q will the devices be exportable will other devices that use the government hardware a voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements case by case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices the same is true for other encryption devices one of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to u s companies operating at home and abroad with this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case by case basis for u s companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad we plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products

re inventing crypto policy an eff statement april initial eff analysis of clinton privacy and security proposal the clinton administration today made a major announcement on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of millions of americans the first part of the plan is to begin a comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to robust encryption and law enforcement issues posed by new technology however eff is very concerned that the administration has already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry before any public comment or discussion has been allowed apparently the administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the national security agency the so called clipper chip is an bit split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips manufactured by a military contractor two separate escrow agents would store users keys and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant the encryption scheme used is to be classified but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for incorporation into its communications products this proposal raises a number of serious concerns first the administration has adopted a solution before conducting an inquiry the nsa developed clipper chip may not be the most secure product other vendors or developers may have better schemes furthermore we should not rely on the government as the sole source for the clipper or any other chips rather independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards second an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested yet the administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified eff believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open the public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is open to independent expert scrutiny third while the use of the use of a split key dual escrowed system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement needs the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is adopted what will give people confidence in the safety of their keys does disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual s fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries these are but a few of the many questions the administrations proposal raised but fails to answer in sum the administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy and security however the clipper chip solution ought to be considered as part of the inquiry and not be adopted before the discussion even begins details of the proposal escrow the bit key will be divided between two escrow agents each of whom hold bits of each key the manufacturer of the communications device would be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow agents a key is tied to the device however not the person using it upon presentation of a valid court order the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents according to the presidential directive just issued the attorney general will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents some in the administration have suggested that one non law enforcement federal agency perhaps the federal reserve and one non governmental organization could be chosen but there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet classified algorithm and the possibility of back doors the administration claims that there are no back doors means by which the government or others could break the code without securing keys from the escrow agents and that the president will be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm in order to prove this administration sources are interested in arranging for an all star crypto cracker team to come in under a security arrangement and examine the algorithm for trap doors the results of the investigation would then be made public the clipper chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole source secret contract between the national security agency and two private firms vlsi and mycotronx nsa work on this plan has been underway for about four years the manufacturing contract was let months ago government as market driver in order to get a market moving and to show that the government believes in the security of this system the feds will be the first big customers for this product users will include the fbi secret service vp al gore and maybe even the president at today s commerce department press briefing a number of people asked this question though why would any private organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had no independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors comprehensive policy inquiry the administration has also announced that it is about to commence an inquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection encryption and law enforcement the items to be considered include export controls on encryption technology and the fbi s digital telephony proposal it appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the national security council unfortunately however the presidential directive describing the inquiry is classified some public involvement in the process has been promised but they terms have yet

re text of white house announcement and q as on clipper chip encryption i am eager to hear the legal theory behind restricting exchange of cryptographic data and encrypted messages given the first admendment the theory behind regulating the personal encryption of one s personal thoughts and feelings seems even less tenable perhaps if we make a treaty with say iceland to restrict crypto paraphernalia can a good end run around the constitution happen treaties as someone pointed out has the force of any other law of the land like the bill of rights amendment congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances amendment a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed amendment no soldier shall in time of peace be quartered in any house without the consent of the owner nor in time of war but in a manner to be prescribed by law amendment the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized amendment no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury except in cases arising in the land or naval forces or in the militia when in actual service in time of war or public danger nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself nor be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation well at least for a few minutes we had some privacy grady netcom com ef e ad d d c f fc ac f d f e f

re secret algorithm re clipper chip and crypto key escrow though some may argue about the nose of the camel it s worth noting that the government proposal is limited to scrambled telephony if it is only used for that purpose and does not extend to electronic mail or file encryption then it is an improvement over the current mass produced standard civilian technology which with a few exceptions is limited to easy to break inverters note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for e mail and files let s focus on this one question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is limited to telephony or if the government intends to expand it though i share many of the concerns expressed by some i find the proposal less threatening than many others since right now most americans have no secure telephony and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a goat can eavesdrop this would also plug up the security hole in cellular and cordless phones reading between the lines i infer that the system is highly secure without access to the keys this would meet the needs of u s businesses confronted by rich and powerful adversaries including french and japanese security services and rich japanese companies it allows the nsa to make available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs most legitimate u s corporations trust the nsa and would be delighted to have a high security system certified by them even at the price of depositing keys in escrow i see no difficulty in creating a reliable escrow corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the week and that system has worked pretty well from my point of view this is a fair starting point there are concerns that need to be addressed including the reliability of the escrows but in return we get access to high security crypto many have suggested that des and other systems may be breakable by the nsa and hence others similarly skilled and endowed there is at least a good possibility which should be checked that the proposed system is not so breakable it doesn t have to be nor does it have to have trapdoors if the government can get the keys pursuant to a legitimate court order thus they can protect legitimate communications against economic adversaries while still being able to eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order in discussing this let s try to avoid the nastiness personal attacks and noise of some previous threads this is a substantive and technical issue and personal remarks have no place in such a discussion david sternlight great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of our information errors and omissions excepted
re re inventing crypto policy an eff statement in article apr eff org danny weitzner djw eff org writes the bit key will be divided between two escrow agents each of whom hold bits of each key presumably the key split is so that no one group controls the privacy of the key and that it would be infeasible to illicitly gain access from both agents however if one agent wishes to break the crypto without the cooperation of the other agent a bit key is not going to stand in the way of a brute force attack if an agency for example the nsa were to hold one of the two key halves then i don t imagine they really need the other half of the key to start listening in or was that the point grin this is not to imply at all that i like the idea of the rest of the system lee brintle and so i leave you with this final word director project panda twang

re keeping your mouth shut was hard drive security in article c k ce a sunfish usd edu vkub charlie usd edu vince kub writes now the original scheme as suggested here would be to have the key disappear if certain threatening conditions are met once the key is gone there is no question of contempt of court as there is nothing to compell the key is no longer there to be produced getting rid of the keys is actually pretty easy to do automatically on a communications link as opposed to storage where the keys have to be retained somehow as long as the owner wants to be able to retrieve the data the right way to do communications security is to generate a random session key with diffie hellman use it for a while and then destroy it once it s gone there s no getting it back and no way to decrypt recordings of the conversation to make sure you aren t being attacked by a man in the middle you have to authenticate your dh exchanges the at t secure phone does this by displaying the dh key so you can compare them verbally over the phone this is nice and simple but it relies on user awareness plus the inability of the man in the middle to duplicate the users voices a better way is to authenticate the exchanges with rsa since you d never use rsa for actual encryption compromising your rsa secret key would only allow someone to impersonate you in a future conversation and even that only until you revoke your public key they would still not be able to decrypt recordings of prior conversations for which the session keys have been destroyed i m convinced that this is how the government s own secure phones the stu iii must work neat eh phil
the old key registration idea okay let s suppose that the nsa nist mykotronix registered key system becomes standard and i m able to buy such a system from my local radio shack every phone comes with a built in chip and the government has the key to every phone call i go and buy a phone and dutifully register the key what s to prevent me from swapping phones with a friend or buying a used phone at a garage sale whooa the secret registered keys just became unsynchronized when the government comes to listen in they only receive gobbledly gook because the secret key registered under my name isn t the right one that leads me to conjecture that the system isn t that secure there are just two master keys that work for all the phones in the country the part about registering your keys is just bogus or the system is vulnerable to simple phone swapping attacks like this criminals will quickly figure this out and go to town in either case i think we need to look at this a bit deeper jbl mw wxld

more clipper stuff as of yet there has been no description of the general principles behind the clipper proposal for example is this a public key system or a private key system if the latter then i don t see how the system could work given that the keys are tied to the device and not the person further the escrowed bit keys are split into two bit chunks i would guess that the availability of one of these bit chunks and a reasonable key search machine would allow you to read the traffic i m not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system but it does make you think of course this is easily fixable by giving out two bit chunks which could be x ored to generate the real bit key philip

nistnews and via the nist computer security bbs at the white house office of the press secretary for immediate release april statement by the press secretary the president today announced a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement the initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting americans rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer it is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files while encryption technology can help americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals a state of the art microcircuit called the clipper chip has been developed by government engineers the chip represents a new approach to encryption technology it can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone it scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today this new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically at the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals a key escrow system will be established to ensure that the clipper chip is used to protect the privacy of law abiding americans each device containing the chip will have two unique keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device when the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two key escrow data bases that will be established by the attorney general access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap the clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the attorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices in addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings the chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption s dual edge sword encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and terrorists we need the clipper chip and other approaches that can both provide law abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities in order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches like the key escrow system the president has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the national information infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of american industry in the global marketplace and the need of u s companies to manufacture and export high technology products the president has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries the congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed the administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a national information infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give americans unprecedented access to information this infrastructure of high speed networks information superhighways will transmit video images hdtv programming and huge data files as easily as today s telephone system transmits voice since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use the administration is committed to policies that protect all americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet the provisions of the president s directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available for additional details call mat heyman national institute of standards and technology questions and answers about the clinton administration s telecommunications initiative q does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations a no clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans q suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device what would they have to do to decipher the message a they would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers the key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system q who will run the key escrow data banks a the two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities at this point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key escrow data banks q how strong is the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security is a this system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today while the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities q whose decision was it to propose this product a the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agencies were involved in this decision this approach has been endorsed by the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet officials q who was consulted the congress industry a we have on going discussions with congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy we have briefed members of congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers a the government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them q who provides the clipper chip a mykotronx programs it at their facility in torrance california and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers the programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future q how do i buy one of these encryption devices a we expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the clipper chip into their devices q if the administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices a this is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review the key escrow mechanism will provide americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the administration is developing the administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have effectively done nor is the u s saying that every american as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product there is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either or proposition rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the clipper chip and similar encryption techniques q what does this decision indicate about how the clinton administration s policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration a it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public interest groups to find innovative ways to protect americans privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism q will the devices be exportable will other devices that use the government hardware a voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements case by case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices the same is true for other encryption devices one of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to u s companies operating at home and abroad with this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case by case basis for u s companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad we plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products
how do they know what keys to ask for re clipper this may be a stupid question but how does the government know which keys to ask for will owners be required to register their phones faxes modems etc and inform the government when they are moved to a different phone number will there be penalities if the public does not do this will identification the national health care id perhaps be required when purchasing a clipper equipted phone or will each chip transmit identifying information at the start of a conversation identification which could be used to automatically log who calls whom the phone company keeps records but this information would be accessable by a well placed van near a microwave relay station this raises the question of how the two phones agree on a communications encryption key will it be something that is derived from information exchanged at the start of the conversation and hence derivable by an eavesdropper bear giles bear fsl noaa gov
re text of white house announcement and q as on clipper chip encryption the stragegy of the government is interesting the real fear comes from them doing more than this this is a voluntary program and thus harder for us to object to on the surface their strategy is a business one rather than legal one they are pushing to get a standard in place a secret standard and if they get it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market it will be legal to sell better untapable encryption that doesn t have registered keys but it will be difficult and thus not a plan for most phone companies you see with clipper chip phones you ll be able to talk to any cellular company or other phones or ports because they will follow the standard at t has already announced a clipper chip encryption product the government has marketed hard to get major vendors to use these chips if they get enough market share they will rule and thus there will be very little market for systems that can t be tapped by the police the public isn t that concerned about it now after all they freely do calls that anybody with an old tv can listen to today they won t pay big extra bucks for proprietary phones that secure them only from the police well some people will buy these phones but they will only work with other proprietary phones so the market will be small and the phones expensive unless they are made in numbers large enough to sell them cheap only the mob will buy them and this means that the fbi will want to track the customer lists of better encryption phones because the only reason a person would want one is to evade the police interesting brad templeton clarinet communications corp sunnyvale ca

an open letter to mr clinton i m quite astonished shocked and appalled at this serious frontal assault on emerging american freedoms the clinton administration nor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever in regulating cryptography to do so is tantamount to regulating acceptable speech and is blatantly unconstitutional perhaps we should rename this year in honor of such an illustrious proposal let the crappy chip live in infamy and the adminstration receive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure i am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology to restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures the u s government will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any serious threat to my liberties such as this and i call on everyone with an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this proposal the administration does not seem to understand that they are merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the public and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is wholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty while encryption technology can help americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals it seems to me that u s diplomatic communications should be tappable by the u n whenever any countries produce a warrant to the u n in fact i think we should stop paying the nsa billions of dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason these actions violate the sovereignity of international law i hope mr clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here but if he isn t it s a modest and reasonable proposal so he should find merit with it nevertheless cryptography is neutral technology if everybody has strong cryptography including policemen bureacrats businessmen housewives thugs and hoodlums we have a sustainable equilibrium anything less is an unworkable anti egaltarian arrangement intrinsically antithetical to american freedoms and guaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent impracticality we don t need to compromise on issues of freedom for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting americans for too long our government has demonstrated itself to be increasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality and protecting americans since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use the administration is committed to policies that protect all americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law it is not possible for the federal government to act quickly or develop consistent comprehensive policies period and even if by some grandiose miracle such a thing were possible it would only be an efficient way to deprive american citizens of fundamental and inalienable rights the administration has to be committed to leaving private industries alone esp on this issue the government has no legitimate role in regulating the content of communications law enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit their surveillance bludgeon they are soon and inevitably to be disarmed of it q if the administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices no such laws can be constitutionally sound and this is equivalent to a veiled threat which i don t appreciate this kind of extortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism i will trade threats for threats and violation for violation the administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have effectively done if the administration did say this it would find itself impeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential established entrenched and explicit constitutional privacy guarantees the administration would have no legal standing whatsoever such an action would be egregiously illegal and criminal and wholly untolerated and disregarded by vast segments of the population nor is the u s saying that every american as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product the u s comprised of a vast majority of people fanatically committed to preserving their privacy in the face of an increasingly totalitarian government is saying just that take your chips and give them to nsa employees as christmas bonuses we can run any algorithm on our computers we damn well please and we will make any chips we please and we will send any bit pattern over our data highways we please and if you try to stop us you will be gradually or abruptly dissolved into nothingness privacy vs law enforcement there is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either or proposition this is an outright dingaling denning lie the two aims of privacy and surveillance are intrinsically and fundamentally incompatible and you have to work for the nsa to think otherwise americans are about to discover ways through the use of technology to preserve their inalienable but forgotten freedoms that have slowly been eroded away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and unrepresentative government ld longs lance colostate edu

re how to detect use of an illegal cipher how can the government tell which encryption method one is using without being able to decode the traffic i e in order to accuse me of using an unauthorized strong encryption technique they would have to take both keys out of escrow run them against my ciphertext and draw a blank i was thinking about this also it s quite possible the system transmits in clear the serial number of the device being used that way they can start a tap get the serial number and use the warrant for the first tap to get the key if they tap someone who s apparently using encryption but don t find that prefix then they ll assume it s an un authorized encryption scheme this doesn t handle superencrypted traffic if the clipper doesn t impose any unfortunate performance side effects there s no reason not to use it to superencrypt a stream of triple des encrypted traffic that way your traffic looks normal and perhaps anyone desiring to listen in won t even bother since they know nobody s going to really trust crypto that has classified internals for important stuff mjr

re the old key registration idea in article qn ic hp access digex net pcw access digex com peter wayner writes okay let s suppose that the nsa nist mykotronix registered key system becomes standard and i m able to buy such a system from my local radio shack every phone comes with a built in chip and the government has the key to every phone call i go and buy a phone and dutifully register the key what s to prevent me from swapping phones with a friend or buying a used phone at a garage sale whooa the secret registered keys just became unsynchronized when the government comes it s very possible even likely that the serial number of the invididual chip is broadcast either in a standard encrypted format so that all the big brother types need to do is listen to the traffic get a court order generally just by saying that they think you may be a crook and go to it r to listen in they only receive gobbledly gook because the secret key registered under my name isn t the right one that leads me to conjecture that the system isn t that secure there are just two master keys that work for all the phones in the country the part about registering your keys is just bogus or the system is vulnerable to simple phone swapping attacks like this criminals will quickly figure this out and go to town in either case i think we need to look at this a bit deeper jbl mw wxld
why the algorithm is secret my thoughts on why the algorithm is secret the chip is regretably likely to become a standard there will be many applications where economic factors dictate use of this chip like it or not if the alrogithm is public and the code is as secure absent the access to escrowed keys as represented an enterprising sort would make compatible crypto chips for which no key had been escrowed this is likely what the release was refering to when they refered to the secrecy of the algorithm protecting the security of the escrow system rob boudrie

re how do they know what keys to ask for re clipper the actual algorithm is classified however their main thrust here is for cellular phones and encryption is only over the radio end not end to end i think end to end will come later and of course you have to identify yourself to the phone company and since the phone company complies with court orders they will know the magic number of your chip when they sign out a warrant on you and then can present the warrant to the key escrow house brad templeton clarinet communications corp sunnyvale ca

once tapped your code is no good any more it occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you and the escrow houses release your code to the cops your code is now no longer secure it s in the hands of cops and while i am sure most of the time they are good their security will not be as good as the escrow houses what this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you at the end of the wiretap they should be obligated to inform you that a tap was performed and replace for free the clipper chip in your cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the escrow houses do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are laid in many ways it would be a positive step if they had to judges set time limits on warrants i assume at the end of the time limit they should have to renew or replace your chip that s if we go with this scheme which i am not sure i agree with brad templeton clarinet communications corp sunnyvale ca

last part the sections of this faq are available via anonymous ftp to rtfm mit edu as pub usenet news answers cryptography faq part xx the cryptography faq is posted to the newsgroups sci crypt sci answers and news answers every days contents in mathematical terms what is a private key cryptosystem what is an attack what s the advantage of formulating all this mathematically why is the one time pad secure what s a ciphertext only attack what s a known plaintext attack what s a chosen plaintext attack in mathematical terms what can you say about brute force attacks what s a key guessing attack what s entropy in mathematical terms what is a private key cryptosystem a private key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system e and a decryption system d the encryption system e is a collection of functions e k indexed by keys k mapping some set of plaintexts p to some set of ciphertexts c similarly the decryption system d is a collection of functions d k such that d k e k p p for every plaintext p that is succesful decryption of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key index as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext into ciphertext such systems wherein the same key value is used to encrypt and decrypt are also known as symmetric cryptoystems what is an attack in intuitive terms a passive attack on a cryptosystem is any method of starting with some information about plaintexts and their corresponding ciphertexts under some unknown key and figuring out more information about the plaintexts it s possible to state mathematically what this means here we go fix functions f g and h of n variables fix an encryption system e and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys an attack on e using g assuming f giving h with probability p is an algorithm a with a pair f g of inputs and one output h such that there is probability p of computing h h p p n if we have f f p p n and g g e k p e k p n note that this probability depends on the distribution of the vector k p p n the attack is trivial or pointless if there is probability at least p of computing h h p p n if f f p p n and g g c c n here c c n range uniformly over the possible ciphertexts and have no particular relation to p p n in other words an attack is trivial if it doesn t actually use the encryptions e k p e k p n an attack is called one ciphertext if n two ciphertext if n and so on what s the advantage of formulating all this mathematically in basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure read part we keep saying a strong cryptosystem must have this property but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem is strong in contrast the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely formulate and if possible prove the statement that a cryptosystem is strong we say for example that a cryptosystem is secure against all passive attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system as defined above is too slow to be practical if we can prove this statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist any passive cryptanalytic technique if we can reduce this statement to some well known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that the cryptosystem isn t easy to break other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical definition again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions we re making and prove that they produce the desired results we can figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used properly it just means that the assumptions are valid the same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too the cryptanalyst can take advantage of incorrect assumptions often he can try to construct a proof of security for a system see where the proof fails and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis why is the one time pad secure by definition the one time pad is a cryptosystem where the plaintexts ciphertexts and keys are all strings say byte strings of some length m and e k p is just the sum let s say the exclusive or of k and p it is easy to prove mathematically that there are no nontrivial single ciphertext attacks on the one time pad assuming a uniform distribution of keys note that we don t have to assume a uniform distribution of plaintexts here s the proof let a be an attack i e an algorithm taking two inputs f g and producing one output h with some probability p that h h p whenever f f p and g g e k p i e g g k p then because the distribution of k is uniform and independent of p the distribution of k p must also be uniform and independent of p but also the distribution of c is uniform and independent of p hence there is probability exactly p that h h p whenever f f p and g g c over all p and c thus a fortiori a is trivial on the other hand the one time pad is not secure if a key k is used for more than one plaintext i e there are nontrivial multiple ciphertext attacks so to be properly used a key k must be thrown away after one encryption the key is also called a pad this explains the name one time pad what s a ciphertext only attack in the notation above a ciphertext only attack is one where f is constant given only some information g e k p e k p n about n ciphertexts the attack has to have some chance of producing some information h p p n about the plaintexts the attack is trivial if it has just as good a chance of producing h p p n when given g c c n for random c c n for example say g c c and say h p is the first bit of p we can easily write down an attack the guessing attack which simply guesses that h p is this attack is trivial because it doesn t use the ciphertext it has a fifty fifty chance of guessing correctly no matter what on the other hand there is an attack on rsa which produces one bit of information about p with success using c if it is fed a random c then the success rate drops to so this is a nontrivial attack what s a known plaintext attack the classic known plaintext attack has f p p p g c c c c and h p p depending only on p in other words given two ciphertexts c and c and one decryption p the known plaintext attack should produce information about the other decryption p note that known plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature as producing information about the key but this is pointless the cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him decrypt further messages what s a chosen plaintext attack a chosen plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical series of active attacks on a cryptosystem attacks where the cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor these attacks don t fit into our model of passive attacks explained above anyway a chosen plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and look at the corresponding ciphertext then repeat until he has figured out how to decrypt any message more absurd examples of this sort of attack are the chosen key attack and chosen system attack a much more important form of active attack is a message corruption attack where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a way as to make a useful change in the plaintext there are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks for instance automatically encrypting any plaintext p as t e k h t r p r p where t is a time key sequence number chosen anew for each message r is a random number and h is a one way hash function here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive or in mathematical terms what can you say about brute force attacks consider the following known plaintext attack we are given some plaintexts p p n and ciphertexts c c n we re also given a ciphertext c n we run through every key k when we find k such that e k p i c i for every i n we print d k c n if n is big enough that only one key works this attack will succeed on valid inputs all the time while it will produce correct results only once in a blue moon for random inputs thus this is a nontrivial attack its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many possible keys what s a key guessing attack what s entropy say somebody is using the one time pad but isn t choosing keys randomly and uniformly from all m bit messages as he was supposed to for our security proof in fact say he s known to prefer keys which are english words then a cryptanalyst can run through all english words as possible keys this attack will often succeed and it s much faster than a brute force search of the entire keyspace we can measure how bad a key distribution is by calculating its entropy this number e is the number of real bits of information of the key a cryptanalyst will typically happen across the key within e guesses e is defined as the sum of p k log p k where p k is the probability of key k

encryption has been shown to be very easy to break the method uses xor with two repeating key streams a typed password and a byte wide counter initialized to the password length full descriptions are

company named accessdata east south orem ut that has a software package that will decrypt any wordperfect lotus quatro pro ms excel and paradox files the cost of the package is steep prices but if you

key cipher a repeated key cipher where the ciphertext is something like the plaintext xor keykeykeykey and so on is called a vigenere cipher if the key is not too long and the plaintext is in english do the following discover the length of the key by counting coincidences see gaines gai sinkov sin trying each displacement of the ciphertext against itself count those bytes which are equal if the two ciphertext portions have used the same key something over of the bytes will be equal if they have used different key then less than will be equal assuming random bit bytes of key covering normal ascii text the smallest displacement which indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key shift the text by that length and xor it with itself this removes the key and leaves you with text xored with itself since english has about bit of real information per byte streams of text xored together has bits of info per bit byte providing plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption and in fact one stream of text xored with itself has just bit per byte if the key is short it might be even easier to treat this as a standard polyalphabetic substitution all the old cryptanalysis

well pgp is most commonly used outside the usa since it uses the rsa algorithm without a license and rsa s patent is valid only or at least primarily in the usa ripem is most commonly used inside the usa since it uses the rsaref which is freely available within the usa but not available for shipment outside the usa since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of the message pgp used idea ripem uses des and rsa for encrypting the message key they should be able to interoperate freely although there have been repeated calls for each to understand the other s formats and algorithm choices no interoperation is available at this time as far as we know is the unix crypt command secure no see ree there is a program available called cbw crypt breaker s workbench which can be used to do ciphertext only attacks on files encrypted with crypt one source for cbw is ftpcb how do i use compression with encryption a number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by some simple encryption method e g xor with a repeated key unfortunately you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact distribution of possible inputs for all practical purposes it s impossible to describe the typical english text beyond coarse characteristics such as single letter frequencies you can build up more and more sophisticated models of your inputs but if the enemy has a slightly more accurate model he ll be able to find some redundancy in your compressed output note that nearly all practical compression schemes unless they have been designed with cryptography in mind produce output that actually starts off with high redundancy for example the output of unix compress begins with a well known three byte magic number that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis this is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a bad idea it just has to be done very very carefully and by no means removes the need for strong encryption compression after encryption is silly is there an unbreakable cipher yes the one time pad is unbreakable see part unfortunately the one time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as plaintext of course a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be useful rather it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is expected to remain valid what does random mean in cryptography cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom number generator than most applications for a source of bits to be cryptographically random it must be computationally impossible to predict what the nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of th through n st bits for all n up to the lifetime of the source a software generator also known as pseudo random has the function of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently random bits this seed must be large enough not to be guessed by the opponent ideally it should also be truly random perhaps generated by a hardware random number source those who have sparcstation workstations could for example generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of entropy by not connecting anything to it for example cat dev audio compress foo gives a file of high entropy not random but with much randomness in it one can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key for example to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo random string when looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy it is important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that because it looks complicated to a human it must be random for example disk operation completion times sound like they might be unpredictable to many people but a spinning disk is much like a clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy what is the unicity point a k a unicity distance see sha the unicity distance is an approximation to that amount of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information entropy in the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number of ciphertext bits used ciphertexts significantly longer than this can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment this is used to back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext only cryptanalysis ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have multiple equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security from the opponent s difficulty choosing the correct one unicity distance like all statistical or information theoretic measures does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives probabilistic results namely the minimum amount of ciphertext for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext when all possible keys are tried for the decryption working cryptologists don t normally deal with unicity distance as such instead they directly determine the likelihood of events of interest let the unicity distance of a cipher be d characters if fewer than d ciphertext characters have been intercepted then there is not enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of possible keys des has a unicity distance of characters which is less than ciphertext blocks each block corresponds to ascii characters this may seem alarmingly low at first but the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work required to find the key after approximately d characters have been intercepted in fact actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used in discussing unicity distance like other measures such as key size unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if it s too small but doesn t guarantee security if it s high few practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis all manner of characteristics might serve as entering wedges to crack some cipher messages however similar information theoretic considerations are occasionally useful for example to determine a recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and information theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most promising directions unfortunately most literature on the application of information statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified even the seminal work of alan turing see koz for some insight into the possibilities see kul and goo what is key management and why is it important one of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption of course one would assume that the cia does not make a habit of telling mossad about its cryptosystems but mossad probably finds out anyway repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress thus especially in modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are transferred both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but also enough key material to cover the traffic key management refers to the distribution authentication and handling of keys a publicly accessible example of modern key management technology is the stu iii secure telephone unit which for classified use employs individual coded crypto ignition keys and a central key management center operated by nsa there is a hierarchy in that certain ciks are used by authorized cryptographic control personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and to perform installation maintenance functions such as the reporting of lost ciks this should give an inkling of the extent of the key management problem for public key systems there are several related issues many having to do with whom do you trust can i use pseudo random or chaotic numbers as a key stream chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from relatively compact generators perhaps the simplest example is a linear congruential sequence one of the most popular types of random number generators where there is no obvious dependence between seeds and outputs unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will in a high enough dimension show up as a regular lattice mathematically this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for cryptanalysts to exploit more complicated generators have more complicated structure which is why they make interesting pictures but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable structure at all see knu exercise ree and boy what is the correct frequency list for english letters there are three answers to this question each slightly deeper than the one before you can find the first answer in various books namely a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of english text of course any such list will be correctly computed but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken the second answer is that the question doesn t make sense what do you mean by english letters the english language is not a fixed finite closed object that can be exactly characterized it has changed over time it is different between different authors any particular message will have different statistics from those of the language as a whole the third answer is that yes no particular message is going to have exactly the same characteristics as english in general but for all reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won t matter in fact there s an entire field called bayesian statistics other buzzwords are maximum entropy methods and maximum likelihood estimation which studies questions like what s the chance that a text with these letter frequencies is in english and comes up with reasonably robust answers so make your own list from your own samples of english text it will be good enough for practical work if you use it properly what is the enigma for a project in data security we are looking for sources of information about the german enigma code and how it was broken by the british during wwii see wel dea koz hod kah how do i shuffle cards card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of values using a random or pseudo random function all possible output permutations of this process should be equally likely to do this you need a random function modran x which will produce a uniformly distributed random integer in the interval x given that function you can shuffle with the following c code assuming arrlth is the length of array arr and swap interchanges values at the two addresses given for n arrlth n n swap arr modran n arr n modran x can not be achieved exactly with a simple ranno x since ranno s interval may not be divisible by x although in most cases the error will be very small to cover this case one can take ranno s modulus mod x call that number y and if ranno returns a value less than y go back and get another ranno value can i foil s w pirates by encrypting my cd rom someone will frequently express the desire to publish a cd rom with possibly multiple pieces of software perhaps with each encrypted separately and will want to use different keys for each user perhaps even good for only a limited period of time in order to avoid piracy as far as we know this is impossible since there is nothing in standard pc or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the keyboard if there were such an identification then the cd rom could be encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in part on the unique identifier however in this case the cd rom is one of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose if the cd rom is to be encrypted once and then mass produced there must be a key or set of keys for that encryption produced at some stage in the process that key is useable with any copy of the cd rom s data the pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the illegal copy can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers schneier chinet chi il us bruce schneier says accessdata of orem utah sells

force search and what is its cryptographic relevance what are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem if a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable then is it guaranteed analysis proof in practice why are many people still using cryptosystems that are relatively easy to break what is cryptology cryptography plaintext ciphertext encryption key the story begins when julius caesar sent messages to his trusted acquaintances he didn t trust the messengers so he replaced every a by a c every b by a d and so on through the alphabet only someone who knew the shift by rule could decipher his messages a cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so that only certain people can see through the disguise cryptography is the art of creating and using cryptosystems cryptanalysis is the art of breaking cryptosystems seeing through the disguise even when you re not supposed to be able to cryptology is the study of both cryptography and cryptanalysis the original message is called a plaintext the disguised message is called a ciphertext encryption means any procedure to convert plaintext into ciphertext decryption means any procedure to convert ciphertext into plaintext a cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms the algorithms are labelled the labels are called keys for instance caesar probably used shift by n encryption for several different values of n it s natural to say that n is the key here the people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are called recipients other people are enemies opponents interlopers eavesdroppers or third parties what references can i start with to learn cryptology for an introduction to technical matter the survey articles given in part are the best place to begin as they are in general concise authored by competent people and well written however these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has developed in the last years or so and are more abstract and mathematical than historical the codebreakers by kahn kah is encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up to the mid s introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from gaines gai or sinkov sin this is recommended especially for people who want to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one the selection of an algorithm for the des drew the attention of many public researchers to problems in cryptology consequently several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared the book of denning den gives a good introduction to a broad range of security including encryption algorithms database security access control and formal models of security similar comments apply to the books of price davies pri and pfleeger pfl the books of konheim kon and meyer matyas mey are quite technical books both konheim and meyer were directly involved in the development of des and both books give a thorough analysis of des konheim s book is quite mathematical with detailed analyses of many classical cryptosystems meyer and matyas concentrate on modern cryptographic methods especially pertaining to key management and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and networks the books of rueppel rue and koblitz kob concentrate on the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography how does one go about cryptanalysis classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of analytical reasoning application of mathematical tools pattern finding patience determination and luck the best available textbooks on the subject are the military cryptanalytics series frie it is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is for the most part gained through the attempted solution of given systems such experience is considered so valuable that some of the cryptanalyses performed during wwii by the allies are still classified modern public key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer or taking a discrete logarithm these are not the traditional fare of the cryptanalyst computational number theorists are some of the most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems what is a brute force search and what is its cryptographic relevance in a nutshell if f x y and you know y and can compute f you can find x by trying every possible x that s brute force search example say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding ciphertext but doesn t know the key he can simply try encrypting the plaintext using each possible key until the ciphertext matches or decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext whichever is faster every well designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this brute force search is impractical advances in technology sometimes change what is considered practical for example des which has been in use for over years now has or about possible keys a computation with this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the mid s the situation is very different today given the dramatic decrease in cost per processor operation massively parallel machines threaten the security of des against brute force search some scenarios are described by garron and outerbridge gar one phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a brute force search of some manageably small space of possibilities what are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem the security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret a strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace as mentioned above the unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and if for some key the unicity distance is much longer than the amount of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key the system is probably strong a strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears random to all standard statistical tests see for example cae a strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks a system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect if a system passes all the tests mentioned above is it necessarily strong certainly not many weak cryptosystems looked good at first however sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is strong by mathematical proof if joe can break this system then he can also solve the well known difficult problem of factoring integers see part failing that it s a crap shoot if a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable then is it guaranteed analysis proof in practice cryptanalytic methods include what is known as practical cryptanalysis the enemy doesn t have to just stare at your ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext for instance he might assume cribs stretches of probable plaintext if the crib is correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the rest of the message or he might exploit isologs the same plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys thus he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he doesn t have a chance sometimes cryptosystems malfunction or are misused the one time pad for example loses all security if it is used more than once even chosen plaintext attacks where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into the encryptor until he can deduce the key have been employed see kah why are many people still using cryptosystems that are relatively easy to break some don t know any better often amateurs think they can design secure systems and are not aware of what an expert cryptanalyst could do and sometimes there is insufficient motivation for anybody to invest the work needed to crack a system

re once tapped your code is no good any more brad templeton brad clarinet com wrote it occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you and the escrow houses release your code to the cops your code is now no longer secure it s in the hands of cops and while i am sure most of the time they are good their security will not be as good as the escrow houses what this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you at the end of the wiretap they should be obligated to inform you that a tap was performed and replace for free the clipper chip in your cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the escrow houses getting the court order to reveal the key also makes decipherable all past conversations which may be on tape or disk or whatver as i understand the proposal i could be wrong but i ve seen no mention of session keys being the escrowed entities as the eff noted this raises further issues about the fruits of one bust leading to incrimination in other areas but is it any worse than the current unsecure system it becomes much worse of course if the government then uses this clinton clipper to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption this is the main concern of most of us i think the camel s nose in the tent etc and it may also become much worse if the ostensible security is increased thus allowing greater access to central office records by the government the conversations being encrypted who will object to letting the government have access to them perhaps even automatically archiving large fractions this was one of the main objections to the s proposal that it would force telecom suppliers to provide easy access for the government one the government has had access to months or years of your encrypted conversations now all it takes is one misstep one violation that gets them the paperwork needed to decrypt all of them do we want anyone to have this kind of power tim may whose sig block may get him busted in the new regime timothy c may crypto anarchy encryption digital money tcmay netcom com anonymous networks digital pseudonyms zero knowledge reputations information markets w a s t e aptos ca black markets collapse of governments higher power public key pgp and mailsafe available

sections of this faq are available via anonymous ftp to rtfm mit edu as pub usenet news answers cryptography faq part xx the cryptography faq is posted to the newsgroups sci crypt sci answers and news answers every days contents what is a product cipher what makes a product cipher secure what are some group theoretic properties of product ciphers what can be proven about the security of a product cipher how are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication what exactly is des what is triple des what is differential cryptanalysis how was nsa involved in the design of des is des available in software is des available in hardware can des be used to protect classified information what are ecb cbc cfb and ofb encryption what is a product cipher a product cipher is a block cipher that iterates several weak operations such as substitution transposition modular addition multiplication and linear transformation a block cipher just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data bytes say all at once then goes on to the next block the notion of product ciphers is due to shannon sha examples of modern product ciphers include lucifer sor des nbs sp networks kam loki bro feal shi pes lai khufu and khafre me a the so called feistel ciphers are a class of product ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round lucifer des loki and feal are examples of feistel ciphers the following table compares the main parameters of several product ciphers cipher block length key bits number of rounds lucifer des loki feal x x pes what makes a product cipher secure nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is completely secure so in practice one begins by demonstrating that the cipher looks highly random for example the cipher must be nonlinear and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends on every bit of the plaintext and the key meyer mey has shown that at least rounds of des are required to guarantee such a dependence in this sense a product cipher should act as a mixing function which combines the plaintext key and ciphertext in a complex nonlinear fashion the fixed per round substitutions of the product cipher are referred to as s boxes for example lucifer has s boxes and des has s boxes the nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a careful design of these s boxes a list of partial design criteria for the s boxes of des which apply to s boxes in general may be found in brown bro and brickell et al bri what are some group theoretic properties of product ciphers let e be a product cipher that maps n bit blocks to n bit blocks let e k x be the encryption of x under key k then for any fixed k the map sending x to e k x is a permutation of the set of n bit blocks denote this permutation by p k the set of all n bit permutations is called the symmetric group and is written s n the collection of all these permutations p k where k ranges over all possible keys is denoted e s n if e were a random mapping from plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect e s n to generate a large subset of s n coppersmith and grossman cop have shown that a very simple product cipher can generate the alternating group a n given a sufficient number of rounds the alternating group is half of the symmetric group it consists of all even permutations i e all permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps even and goldreich eve were able to extend these results to show that feistel ciphers can generate a n given a sufficient number of rounds the security of multiple encipherment also depends on the group theoretic properties of a cipher multiple encipherment is an extension over single encipherment if for keys k k there does not exist a third key k such that e k e k x e k x which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys k k is equal to a single encryption under the third key k if for every k k there exists a k such that eq is true then we say that e is a group this question of whether des is a group under this definition was extensively studied by sherman kaliski and rivest she in their paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that des is not a group in fact des is not a group cam what can be proven about the security of a product cipher recall from above that p k is a permutation produced by e under some key k the goal of the designer of e is to ensure that p k appears to be a random element of s n the symmetric group let r be an element of s n selected randomly we will say that p k and r are indistinguishable if an observer given p k and r in some order cannot distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial time that is with time bounded resources the observer cannot determine which of the permutations is produced by e the optimal decision is no better than simply guessing luby and rackoff lub have shown that a class of feistel ciphers are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by random boolean functions how are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size there are four standard modes of operation and numerous non standard ones as well the standard modes of operation are defined in the u s department of commerce federal information processing standard fips published in see the question about ecb below for more details although they are defined for the des block cipher the modes of operation can be used with any block cipher can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication one may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself that he did or did not generate a message and to prove to himself whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation but one cannot prove these things to another without revealing the key and thereafter that key cannot be used to prove anything about any messages that were authenticated using that key see ansi x and fips for a standard method of message authentication using des what exactly is des des is the u s government s data encryption standard a product cipher that operates on bit blocks of data using a bit key it is defined in fips which supersedes fips fips are federal information processing standards published by ntis des is identical to the ansi standard data encryption algorithm dea defined in ansi x what is triple des triple des is a product cipher which like des operates on bit data blocks there are several forms each of which uses the des cipher times some forms use two bit keys some use three the des modes of operation may also be used with triple des some people refer to e k d k e k x as triple des this method is defined in chapter of the ansi standard x financial institution key management and is intended for use in encrypting des keys and ivs for automated key distribution its formal name is encryption and decryption of a single key by a key pair but it is referenced in other standards documents as ede that standard says section key encrypting keys may be a single dea key or a dea key pair key pairs shoud be used where additional security is needed e g the data protected by the key s has a long security life a key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a single key others use the term triple des for e k d k e k x or e k e k e k x one of us carl ellison keeps advocating des triple use in the form e k tran e k tran e k compress x where each des instance has its own key and iv for cbc mode and tran has been posted on sci crypt it is a large block transposition program taking its key from the data stream itself so that it is not an encryption program on its own part what is differential cryptanalysis differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be applied to any iterated mapping ie any mapping which is based on a repeated round function the method was recently popularized by biham and shamir bih but coppersmith has remarked that the s boxes of des were optimized against this attack some years ago this method has proved effective against several product ciphers notably feal bi a differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of ciphertexts y y whose corresponding plaintexts x x satisfy a known difference d x x where is componentwise xor in the basic biham shamir attack such plaintext pairs are required to determine the key for des substantially fewer pairs are required if des is truncated to or rounds in these cases the actual key can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs for full des this attack is impractical because it requires so many known plaintexts the work of biham and shamir on des revealed several startling observations on the algorithm most importantly if the key schedule was removed from des and a bit key was used the key could be recovered in less than steps thus independent subkeys do not add substantial security to des further the s boxes of des are extremely sensitive in that changing even single entries in these tables yields significant improvement in the differential attack adi shamir is quoted to say nytimes oct i would say that contrary to what some people believe there is no evidence of tampering with the des so that the basic design was weakened how was nsa involved in the design of des according to kinnucan kin tuchman a member of the group that developed des at ibm is quoted as saying we developed the des algorithm entirely within ibm using ibmers the nsa did not dictate a single wire tuchman and meyer another developer of des spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in lucifer they then spent two years strengthening lucifer their basic approach was to look for strong substitution permutation and key scheduling functions ibm has classified the notes containing the selection criteria at the request of the nsa the nsa told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep secrets it uses to make its own algorithms explains tuchman on the other hand a document called involvement of the nsa in the development of des unclassified summary of the united states select committee on intelligence printed in the ieee communications magazine p states in the development of des nsa convinced ibm that a reduced keysize was sufficient indirectly assisted in the development of the s box structures and certified that the final des algorithm was to the best of their knowledge free from any statistical or mathematical weakness clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the nsa the article further states that the nsa did not tamper with the algorithm itself just the parameters which in some sense resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of meyer and tuchman presented above is des available in software several people have made des code available via ftp see part for pathnames stig ostholm ftpso bsd ftpbk eric young ftpey dennis furguson ftpdf mark riordan ftpmr phil karn ftppk a pascal listing of des is also given in patterson pat fips says the algorithm specified in this standard is to be implemented using hardware not software technology software implementations in general purpose computers are not in compliance with this standard despite this software implementations abound and are

agencies for the cryptographic protection of computer data when the following conditions apply cryptographic protection is required and the data is not classified according to the national security act of as amended or the atomic energy act of as amended what are ecb cbc cfb and ofb encryption these are methods for using block ciphers such as des to encrypt messages files and blocks of data known as modes of operation four modes of operation are defined in fips december and also in ansi x fips specifies that when bit ascii data is sent in octets the unused most significant bit is to be set to fips also specifies the padding for short blocks the four des modes of operation are electronic code book ecb cipher block chaining cbc k bit cipher feedback cfb and k bit output feedback ofb

answers every days contents what is the national security agency nsa what are the us export regulations what is tempest what are the beale ciphers and are they a hoax what is the american cryptogram association and how do i get in touch is rsa patented what about the voynich manuscript what is the national security agency nsa the nsa is the official security body of the u s government it was given its charter by president truman in the late s and has continued research in cryptology till the present the nsa is known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the world governments in general have always been prime employers of cryptologists the nsa probably possesses cryptographic expertise many years ahead of the public state of the art and can undoubtedly break many of the systems used in practice but for reasons of national security almost all information about the nsa is classified bamford s book bamfd gives a history of the people and operations of the nsa the following quote from massey mas highlights the difference between public and private research in cryptography if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted behind closed doors without doubt the number of workers engaged today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of those engaged in open research in cryptology for only about years has there in fact been widespread open research in cryptology there have been and will continue to be conflicts between these two research communities open research is common quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in scholarly journals but can a government agency charged with responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break can a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might undermine the effectiveness of his own government s code breakers one might argue that publication of a provably secure cipher would force all governments to behave like stimson s gentlemen but one must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most scientific fields the wonder is not that some conflicts have occurred between government agencies and open researchers in cryptology but rather that these conflicts at least those of which we are aware have been so few and so mild what are the us export regulations in a nutshell there are two government agencies which control export of encryption software one is the bureau of export administration bxa in the department of commerce authorized by the export administration regulations ear another is the office of defense trade controls dtc in the state department authorized by the international traffic in arms regulations itar as a rule of thumb bxa which works with cocom has less stringent requirements but dtc which takes orders from nsa wants to see everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to bxa the newsgroup misc legal computing carries many interesting discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export what people think about those laws and many other complex issues which go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci crypt make sure to consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in jail if you are lucky your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at least heard of the itar what is tempest tempest is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer equipment it was created in response to the discovery that information can be read from computer radiation e g from a crt at quite a distance and with little effort needless to say encryption doesn t do much good if the cleartext is available this way what are the beale ciphers and are they a hoax thanks to jim gillogly for this information and john king for corrections the story in a pamphlet by j b ward goes thomas jefferson beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass of treasure and buried it in bedford county virginia leaving three ciphers with an innkeeper the ciphers describe the location contents and intended beneficiaries of the treasure ward gives a decryption of the second cipher contents called b it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the declaration of independence doi as key b and b are unsolved many documents have been tried as the key to b aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve b by various means with an eye toward splitting the treasure the beale cypher association p o box beaver falls pa you can get the ciphers from the rec puzzles faql by including the line send index in a message to netlib peregrine com and following the directions there are apparently several different versions of the

re secret algorithm re clipper chip and crypto key escrow interestingly enough in designing the escrow we may want to use some rather unusual technology such as sealed boxes of paper or destructive read memory rather than typical computer databases which is fun for a database of hundreds of millions of keys the greatest danger of the escrow database if it were kept on disk would be the chance that a complete copy could somehow leak out you can design lots of protection but with enough corruption a complete copy is always possible storing it on paper or something very hard to copy at once may actually make sense or a medium that can t be copied for example something with very slow access times or which leaves a destructive trail if it is even read of course then it s hard to backup however i think the consequences of no backup the data is not there when a warrant comes are worse than the consequences of a secret backup an audit trail that reveals when data has been access that can t be erased by the humans involved is also necessary brad templeton clarinet communications corp sunnyvale ca

powerful similarity too a unix tool of cryptographic significance is available for anonymous ftp agrep a fast approximate pattern matching tool source code project available from cs arizona edu in directory agrep agrep is a very fast fuzzy search tool with a tremendous number of powerful search options the one most obviously applicable to cryptography key selection is to be able to specify the similarity of matches in the data for example say you make up a password phrase of qimwe l of course you rightly suspect that this key itself is not in any dictionary or word list but how close is it to en entry that could be varied by some crack program to brute force search for it you use agrep to find out looking with argument for none one or two errors no matches good so far but agrep qimwe l bigwordandphraselist finds that the pattern qimwe l is too close to the pattern imsel part of himself and a host of others to be of any cryptographic value as a key an error of level two corresponds to a simple transposition of letters like teh for the a minimally acceptable password would have to pass as least level in order not immediately ruled out as even a remote possibility of being a good password in real cryptographic use my personal passphrases clear at least level on my rather large meg word and phrase lists and for searching for key words in human typed data lots o typos the tool is unexcelled for example for example say i want to find out what people think about gibson s sf book neuromancer in the huge sf lover s archives even with an error distance specification as small as of i will find all those people who think the title was necromancer or other common typos why miss anything also the program can look for up to patterns in parallel at boyer moore sublinear speeds great for a nsa wannabe to look for your name terrorists names special tagalog or religious words etc in the news or e mail spool directories you can even search for ciphertext by using say random three byte combinations and eliminate all texts that don t score the x chi square birthday hits on message size y you think some crypto terrorist is try to foil you by changing the pattern on you no problem try agrep p nsa to find nsa national security agency nsecag no such agency national scrabble association n s a etc you can also specify fixed areas looking for license plate xyz when you know that the letters are correct you might say agrep xyz licenseplatedatabase will find all plates starting with xyz with up to two errors addition substitution deletion in the number area you can also weight the relative cost for substiutions additions or deletion errors for example when searching dna patterns for a particular protein combination you might know that some kinds of damage cause the a nucelotide to drop out more than other errors you could adjust for this bias by setting dc where you set the deletion cost to count as c errors a steganographic use i even used agrep steg eograp e just now to find the correct spelling would be to intentionally introduce errors of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintext and then later recover the orginal it via an agrep pipe lots of possibilities here when only outlaws can have ciphertext also with agrep s powerful extraction options it makes it easy to abstract the hits into a useful form for example agrep d from pgp passphrase zimmerman nsa says output the entire mail record delimited by from that contains pgp and contains either passphrase zimmerman or nsa and agrep has been measured an order of magnitude faster than the second best similarity tool publicly available as usual i will be glad to e mail the source and docs to those who reqest them by e mail if they cannot do an anonymous ftp get this now it is too powerful to stay in the hands of the nsa grady ward vendor to the nsa and proud of it grady netcom com ef e ad d d c f fc ac f d f e f

clipper some new thoughts i d desparately prefer it if we didn t rehash the same arguments that went on ad infinitum last time that s especially true for sci crypt for that matter i ve created alt privacy clipper since the traffic is appearing in many different groups right now i m going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan hence my followup to sci crypt frankly if you re not an absolutist your feelings may turn on some of these issues for example with an bit key simply splitting it into two bit pieces is much less acceptable than other schemes because it means that if just one repository is shall we say overly pliable a would be eavesdropper would need to recover just more bits of key i need not point out in this newsgroup that that s pretty easy to do by exhaustive search a slightly more complex scheme xor ing the key with a random number and then with its complement would produce two bit subkeys neither of which is useful alone that variant is much more resistant to attack clearly one can get even more sophisticated to protect the subkeys even more other thoughts some people have noted the size and complexity of the databases necessary but the id strings the phones emit could be their back door key double encrypted with the escrow repositories public keys for that matter they could do that only with session keys and have no back door at all in that case the fbi would have to bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted this would answer many of the objections along the lines of how do you make sure they stop we can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back door have the switch do the tap but with a digitally signed record of the time phone number etc of the call that provides proof to the escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of the warrant i can suggest other variations too suppose each clipper chip had public key pairs each would be used times after which you d need more keying material not a bad idea in any event this could be used to enforce time limits or rather usage limits on each warrant the keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn t last for very long i suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure apart from the obvious why push a weak algorithm when you ve already got the back door i think that the government is still genuinely concerned about foreign espionage especially aimed at commercial targets this scheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it too i ve heard rumors over the years that some factions within nsa were unhappy with des because it was too good not that they couldn t crack it but it was much too expensive to do so as easily as they d want they re keeping the details secret so that others don t build their own implementations without the back door the cryptographic protocol though is another matter i see no valid reasons for keeping it secret and as i hope i ve shown above there are a lot of ways to do things that aren t quite as bad
how does it really work was re text of white house announcement and q as on clipper chip encryption this announcement is somewhat disconcerting it doesn t do anything evil in and of itself but bodes badly for the future of open algorithms and standards in information security i won t start panicking until unless des or rsa or stuff like that is prohibited but i m a little anxious no doubt it won t be long before someone posts explaining how this just a small part of some far ranging and long lived nsa pkp irs fbi cia handguncontrolinc clinton conspiracy to subvert freedom democracy and mathematics my feeling is that the administration probably isn t that worried about things like des and rsa and pgp and ripem since they ll never be used by a group much wider than us computer geeks the fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things the nsa has been working on this for a long time and it only just now happened to be ready to release to the world at this time the nsa has been working on this for a long time but wasn t able to get the bush administration to go along with this plan i find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy for the unescrowed use of cryptography more likely the administration felt that even escrowed secret algorithm and for all we know trivially breakable cryptography should not be made widely available thus said clipper csrc ncsl nist gov clipper chip announcement this new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically at the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals the majority of the discussion involving this clipper chip seems to pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations does anyone know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog signals the language sort of suggests this but it s hard to say the main thing i just don t get is whether this chip implements symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques anybody know i m guessing symmetric but they don t get very clear about it if it is symmetric how is it useful for anything other than link level encryption with an identical chip at each end how can you negotiate a per session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted third party who knows your key or does it even use a per session key if it s asymmetric what about pkp s patents which they claim cover all methods of doing asymmetric cryptography are they getting royalties or is hiding infringement the real reason for keeping the algorithm secret marc vanheyningen mvanheyn cs indiana edu mime ripem accepted kirk i won t hurt you alien you hit me kirk well i won t hit you again

new clipper chip proposal from the guv i saw this article posted in a local newsgroup i haven t seen it or any followup traffic relating to it in these groups or other groups which i subscribe to so i am posting it here so others can read it check it out and comment on it and provide ideas for handling these sorts of things i have no verification to the accuracy or lack of accuracy of this article but if accurate i find it extremely disturbing especially in light of various abuses of the ssn number regarding privacy i understand it is now to be required in ca to renew a drivers license or to register a car and other proposals regarding smart national identity cards wiretap proposals and such one simply wonders what other gems are in the wings ready to be sprung on the people by our government perhaps suggestions and ideas for preventing this and other such proposals from acquiring the force of law would be useful the cost simply outweighs any possible benefits imo btw reading this makes me think of some ideas a prof denning has been promoting in an even more disturbing form that said with no further comment the article follows begin included article note this file will also be available via anonymous file transfer from csrc ncsl nist gov in directory pub nistnews and via the nist computer security bbs at the white house office of the press secretary for immediate release april statement by the press secretary the president today announced a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement the initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting americans rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer it is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files while encryption technology can help americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals a state of the art microcircuit called the clipper chip has been developed by government engineers the chip represents a new approach to encryption technology it can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone it scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today this new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically at the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals a key escrow system will be established to ensure that the clipper chip is used to protect the privacy of law abiding americans each device containing the chip will have two unique keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device when the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two key escrow data bases that will be established by the attorney general access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap the clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the attorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices in addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings the chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption s dual edge sword encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and terrorists we need the clipper chip and other approaches that can both provide law abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities in order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches like the key escrow system the president has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the national information infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of american industry in the global marketplace and the need of u s companies to manufacture and export high technology products the president has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries the congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed the administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a national information infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give americans unprecedented access to information this infrastructure of high speed networks information superhighways will transmit video images hdtv programming and huge data files as easily as today s telephone system transmits voice since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use the administration is committed to policies that protect all americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet the provisions of the president s directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available for additional details call mat heyman national institute of standards and technology questions and answers about the clinton administration s telecommunications initiative q does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations a no clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans q suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device what would they have to do to decipher the message a they would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers the key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system q who will run the key escrow data banks a the two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities at this point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key escrow data banks q how strong is the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security is a this system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today while the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities q whose decision was it to propose this product a the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agencies were involved in this decision this approach has been endorsed by the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet officials q who was consulted the congress industry a we have on going discussions with congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy we have briefed members of congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers a the government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them q who provides the clipper chip a mykotronx programs it at their facility in torrance california and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers the programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future q how do i buy one of these encryption devices a we expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the clipper chip into their devices q if the administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices a this is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review the key escrow mechanism will provide americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the administration is developing the administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have effectively done nor is the u s saying that every american as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product there is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either or proposition rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the clipper chip and similar encryption techniques q what does this decision indicate about how the clinton administration s policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration a it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public interest groups to find innovative ways to protect americans privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism q will the devices be exportable will other devices that use the government hardware a voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements case by case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices the same is true for other encryption devices one of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to u s companies operating at home and abroad with this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case by case basis for u s companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad we plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products end included

it any worse than the current unsecure system it becomes much worse of course if the government then uses this clinton clipper to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption this is the main concern of most of us i think the camel s nose in the tent etc not to pick on mr may in particular of course but isn t this kind of the domino theory when one little country falls its neighbor will surely follow and before you know it we re all mining salt in siberia for not turning in our captain crunch secret decoder rings i wish i could agree with you ask yourself this why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was known to be at least partially compromised key escrows in this instance why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly evaluated i e algorythm not publically released the answer seems obvious to me they wouldn t there is other hardware out there not compromised des as an example triple des as a better one my suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clipper systems if not we re in trouble given that the clinton administration is not entirely stupid although we d like to think so i cannot believe that they have failed to realize this they know their initiative will fail much as crippled des was never taken seriously the only way their moves can work is by coercion you know little about politics if you don t realize that this is just a first step in the next move it makes no sense otherwise the next move banning or severly crippling crypto not using the clipper system is easily justified why would anyone want other encryption unless they were trying to subvert the government we ve provided you with a very secure alternative so use it or go to jail be fined whatever how can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system the only crypto available in the u s you simply can t and the administration knows it anyone who wanted to keep the govt out of their hair be it for drug dealing or whatever would just buy still available non clipper systems don t sell our crafty clinton types short they can t be that stupid either banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrations collective i q is about that of a potato why do you think at t jumped

jump the gun my interpretation andrew tim may whose sig block may get him busted in the new regime isn t this just a little melodramatic i really wonder to wit the letter i just sent to clinton the white house office of the press secretary c o presidential comment line fax april sir and or madam i must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption and cryptography i am shocked at the clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life it is apparent to me that those who drafted the clipper chip proposal which is incidentally gaining notoriety as the big brother proposal are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm especially one destined for standardization is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors the proper evaluation of an algorithm dep ends on careful scrutiny by these sectors and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm the assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from experts without full disclosure is plain ignorance in addition the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology such as des when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy it seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow no matter how tamper proof the key escrows might be i cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws i can only assume then that the drafters of the clipper chip proposal knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector the only way this proposal makes any sense or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti lize the big brother chip unfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing i expect the big brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the american people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like harmony right to encryption and voluntary it mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more

re how to detect use of an illegal cipher in article apr clarinet com brad clarinet com brad templeton writes your honour the suspect suddenly started using another level of cryptography and we can t tap his phone calls any more he must have something to hide please sign the warrant to search his house what they would need to do though is make sure that nobody has access to decent crypto in the first place they probably can t tell clippered voice from clippered triple desed voice until they get their copy of your key any criminal who s going to use encryption will do it under cover of clipper the only way to avoid this will be to try to prohibit strong encryption i probably shouldn t say this but they could try to detect the use of an illegal cypher by transmitting in the clear some statistical properties of the plaintext an old fashioned wiretap could then detect the use of pre encryption which would drastically increase the measured entropy of the input a countermeasure to this would be to use steganographic techniques which put out voice you can tell if the nsa built this feature in blow on the mike and observe whether a band of thugs comes through your ceiling pgp key by finger or e mail eli ebrandt jarthur claremont edu
re how does it really work was re text of white house announcement and q as on clipper chip encryption marc vanheyningen mvanheyn cs indiana edu writes the main thing i just don t get is whether this chip implements symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques anybody know i don t know but i m as willing to speculate as anyone several people have suggested that the chips use public key cryptography another possibility is to use diffie hellman key exchange or some other algorithm which has a similar effect dh allows both ends to agree on a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography something like des for the encryption how could the back door keys work in this system i can see a few possibilities one is that the dh like algorithm has the property that the session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door keys for one or possibly both communicants perhaps the random numbers used in the dh are seeded by the back door key or some such another possibility as was suggested here earlier is that the chips simply broadcast the session key encrypted with the chip s own internal secret key in this system the back door keys are secret keys usable for decrypting this session key broadcast actually the chip s secret key doesn t need to be a public key in this usage but can be identical to the secret back door key this proposal seems most straightforward to me still another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the message itself has a dual key property that possession of either of two keys can be used to decrypt it one key would be the session key from the dh exchange and the other would be the back door key for the chip it s worth noting that one of the proposals dorothy denning raised during her amazingly prescient on line discussion last november and december was a variation on diffie hellman in which a third party would participate in deriving the session keys this doesn t quite fit into what we know of how clipper works but it hints that those who had early knowledge of clipper or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with clipper designers may have had diffie hellman on their minds hal finney

remote file system security in light of my recent paranoia concerning government proposals i d love to see a unix based encryption scheme that kept some files encrypted on the host machine say all the files in your home directory used a key system that could not be compromised by eavesdropping over a modem line it seems that this would require modifications to a shell program and a way of telling whether a file was encrypted or not among other things i d love to know about potential security holes in such a system does such a system exist if it were made easy to use and readily available i think it would be a good thing tm i realize that this would probably just involve putting a nice front end on a readily available and very secure encryption scheme but it should be done thanks for the ear brad

re once tapped your code is no good any more in article apr clarinet com brad clarinet com brad templeton writes in article tcmayc m xv jex netcom com tcmay netcom com timothy c may writes getting the court order to reveal the key also makes decipherable all past conversations which may be on tape or disk or whatver as i understand the proposal i could be wrong but i ve seen no mention of session keys being the escrowed entities true in theory in practice the technology of cellular phones will probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext without the key if the frequency path depends on they key as i understand it to it could be made effectively impossible to record i am not an expert in the cryptography science but some basic things seem evident to me things which this clinton clipper do not address the all pertain to opportunites for abuse and conclusions based on what i have seen the membership of this group except for two notable persons agree to if anything bad is possible by the government in theory it almost always ends up happening in fact so the key is to make abuse impossible question authority and remember power does corrupt i think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it will be expanded to include other data forms such as data transfer and stored data and as such should be treated as if it were expanded or such expansion will be almost impossible to stop using clipper as a precident there was a hint of that in the proposal remember that said please bear with me i am not very articulate so i take more words to say what others could say much more briefly thank you once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access the telco isn t supposed to give that without a warrant that s the rule today as i suggested this is now the hint is in the proposal that this or similar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions such as data transfer data files and such largely dependent on how this thing is accepted or flies i think one would be wise to treat this in the manner one would when not if it gets expanded to other areas than cellular phones i think this is guaranteed to happen if this proposal gets by salami politics it has been and is used in several other areas it is certain to be used here government is not going to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop whenever they want to court order required has proven to be a rather flimsy guarantee if the case warrants they can always sieze the material and force one to give the key or sit in jail forever on periodically renewed contempt charges so it is not denying the justice system the information nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty or refuses to divulge the means to access the info this is not protected under the fifth one can be forced to perform acts that would result in divulging incriminating evidence so blocking restrictions on private encryption is not preventing legitimate law enforcement it does make illegitimate law enforcement a bunch more difficult especially fishing expeditions without the target s knowlege don t give up the right to be safe from that that should be non negotiable and clinton and co know it which is probably why they quietly developed this thing figuring if they get it this far they can ram it on through how come those consulted could be roughly described as us insiders they cannot quietely impliment it though when they ban other schemes to ensure its exclusive use hence the nice pr document to try and reassure everyone don t buy into it has government really earned that kind of trust past or future to be secure and free one must keep government honest and the only way to do that is to make abuse impossible not unlikely or difficult but even so the evidence would not be admissible i think unless the judge so ordered i think that even interception of the crypttext without a warrant would be illegal cops can t record today s plain cellular calls and then ask a judge hey can we have permission to listen to those tapes can they so what one could use information gained by re use of the keys saved after the last case was finished or other means master key backdoor easily broken algorithm to find other evidence which given to a judge would authorize a tap which wouldn t have been possible otherwise this has been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past for local cops this might be workable to keep them honest but the feds have a workaround somehow bet on it does anyone really believe for example that the government will use a scheme nsa cannot listen in on scanning for keywords either easily defeated in realtime or via a master key i sure don t this whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use old fashioned police work to build a case in the past eavesdropping was rather easy with or without a court order i think the law enforcement community has become a bit spoiled and will resist changes that require them to revert to using old fashioned detective work i just find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much about civil and individual rights that puts people first the question is put people first to where with the innards not being revealed how is one to be sure there doesn t exist a master key for use by nsa etc so they can do their keyword scan etc on conversations they routinely monitor without a specific court order remember the cellular phone limitiation is only temporary bet on it and so far i have not heard about police telling people that they have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found what is to keep them from simply keeping the keys on file for next time after awhile they would have quite a collection kept especially for folks they deem disruptive and if they get only one key that would reduce the search space a lot unless it is an rsa scheme remember nixon years need for court orders really slowed them down didn t it and unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled fat chance i see one ending up being under say treasury the other under justice it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to a competitor s clinton clipper or descendent when this idea is expanded to be used for all non government encryption enough bucks would get one the keys or the innards for this algorithm perhaps not an important concern but given past government behavior and the other problems worse of course if the government then uses this clinton clipper to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption this is the main concern of most of us i think the camel s nose in the tent etc yes that is a major concern but i think that they think they can win just by having of the usa use this system they don t even have to care about the cautious that s left they don t catch the really smart crooks anyway john gotti who would have to be retarded not to realize he was likely to be wiretapped glibly chatted away on his tapped phone about murder plans that s why he s in jail now hard to believe but true what will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption you can bet that if clipper is accepted that will be next on the agenda it is even hinted at in the proposal read it carefully expect the argumet well if you got nothing to hide fine then using that argument one should not object to video cameras being installed in every room of one s home granted an exteme expansion of the idea but the principle holds private stuff should remain private even from a govt fishing expedition and laws rules may change in the future as to safeguards when it comes to the fed government safeguards are pretty meaningless if they want to do get something don t work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights or establish bad precidents please the price could be hell to pay later this scheme can succeed without laws forbidding more which people would fight a lot harder they like this enough that they are dropping the so called digital telephony proposal according to rumours however the meaning of that is complex since they still want to get at the crypttext on telco systems and that requires a bit of work people would fight laws forbidding more now but in say two years because we have this crisis situation which must be addressed by some drastic action just this added reasonable restriction will only bother those who have someting to hide etc please don t buy into it if the clinton clipper is so very good why not make its algrithm public so many people can exchange ideas and examine it rather than a few isolated respected experts respected by whom for what perhaps a certain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected experts this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was advocating if i recall how would anybody know that what the experts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the clipper chip if it is kept secret perhaps the clipper will use a crippled version with a master key provision or features not present in the version subjected for study and evaluation by the experts and who chooses the expertes the government no conflict of interest there and isn t it a requirement for any decent encryption scheme that it not have its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known i was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything you have except for the key s i recall ideas presented to this group are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret another question since it is a safe bet this clipper thing would not be used for government security they are regarding it as not real secure but good enough for common folk i think i would like to see a full description not a pr non statement of just what good enough means i think when saying how strong it is good enough really means not very the excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not acceptable other countries do not have our bill of rights and constitution which the people not the governments of those other countries often regard with envy what we have as rights they have as revokable privileges and if we expect to retain those rights and protections we must not allow them to be gutted because we just gotta have this thing to fight crime we have allready have our bill of rights pretty much torn to shreds we should not permit more weakining for yet another noble cause instead we should be trying to repair the damage our crime problem may have a number of causes but too many rights and safeguards is not a signifigant one a broken court system and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having too many rights disregarding addressing the root causes for crime etc btw those who suggest that this is just an attack on clinton believe this i would be going ballistic reagardless who seriously proposed this thing it is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights under the constitution or bill of rights the last couple of decades have been a non stop series of end runs around the protections of the

re once tapped your code is no good any more in apr clarinet com brad clarinet com brad templeton writes it occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you and the escrow houses release your code to the cops your code is now no longer secure a very good point it s in the hands of cops and while i am sure most of the time they are good their security will not be as good as the escrow houses why should we expect the cops to be honest they re underpaid for the risks they face every day the media dumps on the all the time and blames them for all sorts of discrimination brutality how can we expect them to be more than human besides there are lots of cases of police abuses ranging from protection scams to outright robbery when i worked in d c there was a breakin at a local radio shack and the alarm company heard the cops responding to the call over the audio pickup in the store what this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you at the end of the wiretap they should be obligated to inform you that a tap was performed and replace for free the clipper chip in your cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the escrow houses then you would know that big brother had been listening does he really want to let you know do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are laid in many ways it would be a positive step if they had to judges set time limits on warrants i assume at the end of the time limit they should have to renew or replace your chip that s if we go with this scheme which i am not sure i agree with i m completely against anything that makes it easier for the government to encroach on the rights of individuals the founders of this country spent a lot of effort limiting the power of the government and specifying exactly what the governments rights were and this didn t include a gov t spy in every bedroom imho there are entirely too many things going on today designed to preserve the government organism at the expense of individuals look around and reread and many early heinlein books aren t there many parallels between the thought police can you spell waco texas and heinlein s crazy years bill internet bill celestial com bill campbell celestial software uucp thebes camco bill east mercer way uunet camco bill mercer island wa speed costs money how fast do you want to go
re secret algorithm re clipper chip and crypto key escrow in article strnlghtc lgfi jqa netcom com strnlght netcom com david sternlight writes though some may argue about the nose of the camel it s worth noting that the government proposal is limited to scrambled telephony if it is only used for that purpose and does not extend to electronic mail or file encryption then it is an improvement over the current mass produced standard civilian technology which with a few exceptions is limited to easy to break inverters note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for e mail and files let s focus on this one question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is limited to telephony or if the government intends to expand it though i share many of the concerns expressed by some i find the proposal less threatening than many others since right now most americans have no secure telephony and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a goat can eavesdrop this would also plug up the security hole in cellular and cordless phones reading between the lines i infer that the system is highly secure without access to the keys this would meet the needs of u s businesses confronted by rich and powerful adversaries including french and japanese security services and rich japanese companies it allows the nsa to make available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs most legitimate u s corporations trust the nsa and would be delighted to have a high security system certified by them even at the price of depositing keys in escrow i see no difficulty in creating a reliable escrow corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the week and that system has worked pretty well from my point of view this is a fair starting point there are concerns that need to be addressed including the reliability of the escrows but in return we get access to high security crypto many have suggested that des and other systems may be breakable by the nsa and hence others similarly skilled and endowed there is at least a good possibility which should be checked that the proposed system is not so breakable it doesn t have to be nor does it have to have trapdoors if the government can get the keys pursuant to a legitimate court order thus they can protect legitimate communications against economic adversaries while still being able to eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order let me ask you this would you trust richard nixon with your crypto keys i wouldn t doug holland
clipper chip technical details i received the following two notes from martin hellman with details on how clipper will work they are posted with his permission the implications of some details are fascinating date sat apr pdt from martin hellman hellman isl stanford edu to a long list of recipients subject clipper chip most of you have seen the announcement in friday s ny times etc about nist national institute of standards technology announcing the clipper chip crypto device several messges on the net have asked for more technical details and some have been laboring under understandable misunderstandings given the lack of details in the news articles so here to help out is your friendly nsa link me i was somewhat surprised friday to get a call from the agency which supplied many of the missing details i was told the info was public so here it is the cc of this to dennis branstad at nist is mostly as a double check on my facts since i assume he is aware of all this please let me know if i have anything wrong the clipper chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in silicon each chip will have two secret bit keys one will be the same for all chips ie a system wide key and the other will be unit specific i don t know what nist and nsa will call them but i will call them the system key sk and unit key uk in this message the ic will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so that the system key can be kept secret aside it is clear that they also want to keep the algorithm secret and in my opinion it may be as much for that as this stated purpose the unit key will be generated as the xor of two bit random numbers k and k uk k k which will be kept by the two escrow authorities who these escrow authorities will be is still to be decided by the attorney general but it was stressed to me that they will not be nsa or law enforcement agencies that they must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased when a law enforcement agency gets a court order they will present it to these two escrow authorities and receive k and k thereby allowing access to the unit key uk in addition to the system key each user will get to choose his or her own key and change it as often as desired call this key plain old k when a message is to be sent it will first be encrypted under k then k will be encrypted under the unit key uk and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part message which will then be encrypted under the system key sk producing e e m k e k uk serial number sk when a court order obtains k and k and thence k the law enforcement agency will use sk to decrypt all information flowing on the suspected link aside it is my guess that they may do this constantly on all links with or without a court order since it is almost impossible to tell which links over which a message will flow this gives the agency access to e m k e k uk serial number in the above message they then check the serial number of the unit and see if it is on the watch list for which they have a court order if so they will decrypt e k uk to obtain k and then decrypt e m k to obtain m i am still in the process of assessing this scheme so please do not take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed scheme all i am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme more knowledgably but i will say that the need for just one court order worries me i would feel more comfortable though not necessarily comfortable if two separate court orders were needed one per escrow authority while no explanation is needed the following story adds some color in researching some ideas that silvio micali and i have been kicking around i spoke with gerald gunther the constitutional law expert here at stanford and he related the following story when edward levi became pres ford s attorney general right after watergate he was visited by an fbi agent asking for the wiretap authorizations when levy asked for the details so he could review the cases as required by law the agent told him that his predecessors just turned over blank signed forms every time levi did not comply and changed the system but the lesson is clear no single person or authority should have the power to authorize wiretaps or worse yet divulging of personal keys sometimes he or she will be an edward levi and sometimes a john mitchell martin hellman date sun apr pdt from martin hellman hellman isl stanford edu to smb research att com subject re clipper chip it is fine to post my previous message to sci crypt if you also post this message with it in which i ask recipients to be sparse in their requesting further info from me or asking for comments on specific questions by this posting i apologize for any messages i am unable to respond to i already spend too much time answering too much e mail and am particularly overloaded this week with other responsibilities i note a probably correction sent to me by dorothy denning she met with the person from nsa that i talked with by phone so her understanding is likely to better than mine on this point where i said the transmitted info is e e m k e k uk serial number sk she says the message is not double encrypted the system key or family key as she was told it is called only encrypts the serial number or the serial number and the encrypted unit key this is not a major difference but i thought it should be mentioned and thank her for bringing it to my attention it makes more sense since it cuts down on encryption computation overhead

big brother clipper chip there are some issues which come to mind when one considers the law enforcement aspects of the use of the big brother clipper chip the drug dealers and terrorists aren t going to let themselves be caught by using this type of encryption in the new york times reported that government investigators broke up a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticated equipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring to eavesdrop on the law enforcement agents who were trying to arrest them a mr deely an nsa official said there are a lot of medium sized countries that would have been proud to have the signals intelligence operation of this group for every john gotti there are probably many more people who have the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecure communications are the press given to the big brother chip will only increase their numbers even if there is some benefit to law enforcement through the use of big brother it must be weighed against the constitutional and civil liberties questions involved for example in some areas of the world torture is used as an investigative tool by the local law enforcement people i suspect it is an effective means of obtaining information and shortening many investigations it probably also helps keep the conviction rate high the fact that the torture tool is not used in this country even with a court order obtained by showing probable cause is because we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency and what is ethically and morally right i think that the same question of expediency versus morality should come into play when considering the use of big brother i vote for morality i am quite disturbed by what i interpret as a veiled threat to prohibit the use of all encryption if this big brother chip is not put into wide spread use after a quick reading of the white house press release i came away with that impression to most of the american public the word hacker has rightly or wrongly come to mean high tech adolescent vandal it has struck me that most of the people posting to sci crypt regarding this issue are intelligent thoughtful individuals who have genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issues surrounding big brother i hope that the use of big brother does not become mandatory and other encryption become illegal i would hate to see this become some kind of high tech volstead act the high speed digital communications revolution is coming at us with the speed of an sst the times they are a changing and just as ibm is learning that they can t do business the same way they have done it for the past years maybe nsa should evaluate another approach eff who have correctly questioned the cryptographic strength of big brother may need to send a stronger message out regarding the constitutional issues involved al gore may want to think this one through a little more and as for dorothy elizabeth robling denning en quoi cela vous concerne cheri

fighting the clipper initiative here are some ideas for those of you who want to oppose the white house clipper chip crypto initiative i think this is going to be a tough measure to fight since the government has invested a lot of resources in developing this high profile initiative they are serious about it now it won t be as easy as it was defeating senate bill in possible actions to take in response mobilize your friends to to all the things on this list and more work the press talk with your local newspaper s science and technology reporter write to your favorite trade rags better yet write some articles yourself for your favorite magazines or newspapers explain why the clipper chip initiative is a bad idea remember to tailor it to your audience the general public may be slow to grasp why it s a bad idea since it seems so technical and arcane and innocent sounding try not to come across as a flaming libertarian paranoid extremist even if you are one lobby congress write letters and make phone calls to your member of congress in your own district as well as your two us senators many members of congress have aides that advise them of technology issues talk to those aides involve your local political parties the libertarian party would certainly be interested there are also libertarian wings of the democrat and republican parties the right to privacy has a surprisingly broad appeal spanning all parts of the political spectrum we have many natural allies the aclu the nra other activist groups that may someday find themselves facing a government that can suppress them much more efficiently if these trends play themselves out but you must articulate our arguments well if you want to draw in people who are not familiar with these issues contribute money to the electronic frontier foundation eff and computer professionals for social responsibility cpsr assuming these groups will fight this initiative they need money for legal expenses and lobbying mobilize opposition in industry companies that will presumably develop products that will incorporate the clipper chip should be lobbied against it from within and from without if you work for a telecommunications equipment vendor first enlist the aid of your coworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative and then present your company s management with a united front of engineering talent against this initiative write persuasive memos to your management with your name and your colleagues names on it hold meetings on it publicize deploy and entrench as much guerrilla techno monkeywrenching apparatus as you can that means pgp anonymous mail forwarding systems based on pgp pgp key servers etc the widespread availability of this kind of technology might also be used as an argument that it can t be effectively suppressed by government action i will also be working to develop new useful tools for these purposes be prepared to engage in an impending public policy debate on this topic we don t know yet how tough this fight will be so we may have to compromise to get most of what we want if we can t outright defeat it we may have to live with a modified version of this clipper chip plan in the end so we d better be prepared to analyze the government s plan and articulate how we want it modified philip zimmermann

why the clipper algorithm is secret the cryptographic protocol though is another matter i see no valid reasons for keeping it secret and as i hope i ve shown above there are a lot of ways to do things that aren t quite as bad it just occurred to me why the algorithm is secret if it were published one could then build physically identical clone versions of the chip that would interoperate with official clipper chips but the cloner wouldn t provide the keys to the escrow houses hmmn or is there a technical hack that i ve missed e g how about if the chips were made unprogrammed but serialized and then shipped to the two escrow houses who programmed in their halves of the keys but in a way that requires that secret keys known only to the escrow houses be installed as well without which clone versions wouldn t interoperate this is getting awfully complicated but that s crypto for you john r levine iecc pob cambridge ma johnl iecc cambridge ma us ima spdcc world iecc johnl time is money steal some today

some thoughts on clipper proposal i envision incorporation of new standart into various communication systems thus making it prevalent on the market therefore cheap the way to do that may be detaching crypto chip from communication equipment it seems logical to provide clipper chip to the end user not as a part of phone fax modem like but in the form of smart card compatible with various telecomm products banks will encourage extensive use of new cards to make transactions by phone natural step will be to cross reference this card to the person in the government databases or else this new version of wiretap proposal make no sence at all one wish to eavesdrop spell on the particular person not on the particular modem or phone as a side note i disagree with one poster who said he won t care about ability of the government to eavesdrop since they can do that now anyway clipper will take away electronic survelliance from citizens making it monopoly of the government may be we can find examples when interceptions made by unauthorised people uncovered crimes of state officials for pgp public key finger mkagalen lynx dac northeastern edu

competing standard perhaps one way of getting away from this cripple chip that the u s government seems to be pushing would be to come up with a good alternative for example how about a scheme using rsa and some hybrid of des cfb and another strong stream cipher maybe idea cfb this could be substantially the same as the cripple chip except that instead of key registration the police could demand that you give up your secret key to them with a court issued warrant then they could read the last few months of wiretapped messages you ve sent and assuming you ve committed no crimes you could generate a new key pair and go about your business i find that i d be willing to pay rsa for the right to use such a system especially given the alternative if you were unwilling to give up your secret key then you d probably stay in jail has anyone got a real legal precedent for this this would allow court issued warrants to be used to gather information on suspected criminals but it couldn t be done in secrecy and there would be enormously less likelihood of corruption or theft of escrowed keys maybe someone from the law enforcement or intelligent community will correct me but this doesn t seem like such a big loss in terms of law enforcement capabilities any comments john kelsey

re secret algorithm re clipper chip and crypto key escrow strnlght netcom com david sternlight writes though some may argue about the nose of the camel it s worth noting that the government proposal is limited to scrambled telephony if it is only used for that purpose and does not extend to electronic mail or file as usual david sternlight is demonstrating his inability to read the proposal clearly states the initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links it speaks about telecommunications in general read it again david maybe you ll understand it the next time nah probably not encryption then it is an improvement over the current mass produced standard civilian technology which with a few exceptions is limited to easy to break inverters that s exactly what the government wants all sheep minded people to think let s look at the current situation it allows to almost anybody to eavesdrop almost everybody unless secure and i mean secure encryption is used what will happen when if ha optimists the new proposal gets accepted almost nobody except some will be able to eavesdrop everybody else but the ability of these some to eavesdrop will be guaranteed the proposal emphasizes on the former almost nobody which is clearly an improvement and forgets to mention the drawbacks of the latter guaranteed yes my statement assumes that the next step will be to make the strong crypto unlawful you think that it will not happen good luck note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap it s not just continued ability it s guaranteed ability before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for e mail and files let s focus on this yeah that s exactly what your government wants you to think let s take small steps one at a time concentrate on the current one don t think about the future trust us one question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is limited to telephony or if the government intends to expand it it s not asked because the proposal clearly says that this is the intention they unlike you read what they write though i share many of the concerns expressed by some i find the proposal less threatening than many others since right now most americans have no secure telephony and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a goat can eavesdrop this would also plug up the security hole in cellular and cordless phones yes it will it will stop the jerk who is eavesdropping now it will allow only to the government to eavesdrop if the scheme is secure of course which is yet to be proven but how do you know that the jerk you are fearing now will not get a government job tomorrow the new proposal guarantees him the ability to eavesdrop then hell that will even motivate him to get that job if he indeed is that mentally pervert reading between the lines i infer that the system is highly secure without access to the keys great the greatest cryptographer of all times david sternlight tm has succeeded to evaluate the new system in the absense of any details whatsoever and has concluded that it is highly secure i guess that comes from the background of working some years for the two major crypto evaluating companies right gee now the government can save all that money and trouble to ask a secret council of crypto experts to secretly analyse the new secret method for david sternlight has already done all the job for them this would meet the needs of u s businesses confronted by rich and powerful adversaries including french and japanese security services and rich japanese companies it allows the nsa to make available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs trust us we re from the government and we re here to help you most legitimate u s corporations trust the nsa and would be delighted to have a high security system certified by them even at the price of depositing keys in escrow i see no difficulty in creating a reliable those who are prepared to trade their liberties for the promises of future safety do not deserve either this or something like that i don t have the exact quote but the meaning is the same has been said by one of your great men maybe you should study their works more carefully if you have the brains to understand them of course from my point of view this is a fair starting point there are concerns that need to be addressed including the reliability of the escrows but in the main question is to guarantee to availability of really secure cryptography to the masses gee if the proposal was saying we guarantee that every american will still have the full right to use any kind of encryption s he would like and regard this proposal as just a default voluntary implementation there would have been much less opposition for some reason they didn t even try to promise you that i wonder why was orwell off only by years return we get access to high security crypto no in return you get crypto that is guaranteed to be crippled many have suggested that des and other systems may be breakable by the nsa and hence others similarly skilled and endowed while the above is just rumors and while even if it is true it is not done easily the new scheme can is guaranteed to be easily breakable by anybody who has the two keys it might be also breakable by somebody who does not have them but knows the right trick or who has only one of them nsa also told you that des is secure why don t you simply trust them huh there is at least a good possibility which should be checked that the proposed system is not so breakable it doesn t have to it is guaranteed to be easily breakable just get the keys it might be even easier but until there is some evidence this is just a wild speculation be nor does it have to have trapdoors if the government can get the keys the trapdoors are there in government s hands the keys pursuant to a legitimate court order thus they can protect legitimate communications against economic adversaries while still being able to eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order legitimate and who decides what communications are legitimate oh i guess it s the government right the guys who already have the keys it s kinda if i have the keys from your car and i am asked to decide who has the right to use it legitimately in discussing this let s try to avoid the nastiness personal attacks and noise of some previous threads impossible since you are

report on privacy protecting off line cash available i recently published a new privacy protecting off line electronic cash system as a technical report at cwi being a phd student at david chaum s cryptography group our group has a long history in research in the field of privacy protecting cash systems the report is called cs r ps z contains pages and can be retrieved from ftp cwi nl from the directory pub cwireports aa the postscript file is suitable for dpi laserprinters abstract from coverpage we present a new off line electronic cash system based on a problem called the representation problem of which little use has been made in literature thus far our system is the first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms using the representation problem as a basic concept some techniques are introduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier systems as a consequence our cash system is much more efficient in both computation and communication complexity than any such system proposed previously another important aspect of our system concerns its provability contrary to previously proposed systems its correctness can be mathematically proven to a very great extent specifically if we make one plausible assumption concerning a single hash function the ability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the diffie hellman problem our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in previously known systems in our opinion the most interesting of these is that the entire cash system including all the extensions can be incorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers which has the important advantage that double spending can be prevented in the first place rather than detecting the identity of a double spender after the fact in particular it can be incorporated even under the most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have negligible probability of success independent of computing power by a simple mechanism from within the system which is something that previous solutions lack entirely furthermore the basic cash system can be extended to checks multi show cash and divisibility while retaining its computational efficiency cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system i made a particular effort to keep the report as self contained as possible nevertheless if you have any questions please e mail to me and i will try to reply as good as i can any comments are also welcome stefan brands cwi kruislaan sj amsterdam the netherlands tel e mail brands cwi nl

re more technical details hmm followup on my own posting well who cares first let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the clipper chip from what hellman and denning were able to tell us the chip itself is not confined to digital telephony but performs general encryption in a symmetric manner the chip supports cfb ofb ecb and whatever the fourth mode of operation for des is the algorithm consists of rounds of whatever and takes bit keys input data seems to be bit yes so if two people want secure communication whatever that means when clipper is involved they have first to agree on one secret key or is it one key per direction they can exchange this key via dh schemes or however somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the clipper chip which is now ready to work the clipper chip carries an unique serial number bit s and key bits these key bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial number with seed bits the seed bits seem not to be stored in the chip at beginning of communication and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin before sending the fist real bit output of the first encryption the clipper chip put s out packets i guess which represent the serial number and the session key this might look like x e k chipkeyk k serial number where x is a transformation of these packets involving a family key this family sp key is equal for all chips x might be a simple xor after that the digital phone call can be done as usual every packet being encrypted and decrypted by clipper denning describes how k and k shall be generated using a seed of bit s now leaving alone politics which does not concern me as much as you not being an american citicien tm there are some weak points in this scheme which might be exploited by several parties as far as i know about the generation of k k s and s look like the obvious backdoor they could be used to generate the chip keys by knowing the serial number and also the family key of the chip i really can t imagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise as true random sources for the generation of the k k can be bought for not to much money then the escrows each of them will get bit of a bit key security could as little as existant be maximized by giving them bits each which have to be xored together to give the k k now let s simply assume the escrows are trustworthy and can t be fooled by criminals or law enforchemnt agencies and there will be no quarrel between escrows and l e a which would hinder the l e a in doing their duties and so on and so on once the keys are surrendered the corresponding chip is compromised forever not very clever imho how about sending in the encrypted session keys for each phone call that the police or whoever want s to listen to escrows could then simply decode this session key and send it back to police and would naturally not do this after the warrant has expired this would be a better technical solution but i guess politics will not work that way apparently as miss dennings stated the only one performing actually decodes of intercepted messages shall be the fbi great so local guys can not inter cept understand your traffic anymore does this mean that the fbi monopolizes the right to do legal wiretaps how is law over there i have no idea who is allowed to tap and who not this certainly means that watched communi cations will be routed automatically from the service providing company to the fbi if the communicaiton is a watched one and this means as far as i understand it that the family key has to be known by each switching company and those providing cellular phone servies etcetc so the family key will not be very secret and thus serial numbers of calls will be readable by anybody who cares i like traffic analysis what do you guess what happens if you use the chip in ecb mode and the first few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled so the session key would not be actually broadcasted over the line hmmm shouldn t be so difficult to do that and now a last point for the other side after all i have read and heard about clipper not the programming language for dbase is it it seems to have many advantages which shold not be overseen now an afterthought to your rights please note that i have no idea what i am talking about from grady netcom com ef amendment congress

trewesday astron s r thanks for posting this and making it available this post will be long i will comment on most of it and am reluctantly leaving all of the original in place to provide context please note that an alt group has been set up for the clipper stuff note this file will also be available via anonymous file transfer from csrc ncsl nist gov in directory pub nistnews and via the nist computer security bbs at the white house office of the press secretary for immediate release april statement by the press secretary the president today announced a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary hum at t vlsi and mykotronx are industry wonder what happened to ibm this should be right up their street and a mandateed scheme is voluntary mr orwell would love this program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement telephone encryption and scrambleing are years behind digital ones like rsa idea or even des the above while literaly true is a clasic straw man claim in the context of non real time circuits such as e mail and the like the initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links i would modestly propose that a mandated use of isdn would do more for commun ications than this lot for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting americans rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer it is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files while encryption normmaly des technology can help americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals note the use of the word business in the above the whole tenor of this release seems to be establishing a ground rule that only business use is legitimate for debate if you want the nothings you drop in your wife s ear to remain secret and private that is not even on the agenda for debate note that there is no role for you to contain private info in this the only reference is to information already in the hands of others the unauthorized release bit is also drawing a long bow most of these cases are by people who have legitimate access abusing it and revealing or often selling the info these people are of course in this proposal the people who will have the keys the criminals also use lawers courts the cia white house officials and pens to go about their business when will they be outlawed as well yeah several of them would be a better idea than clipper them again the protections of law and the courts have been seriously erroded over the last decade ofr so a state of the art microcircuit called the clipper chip has been developed by government engineers the chip represents a nsa new approach to encryption technology yeah this bit is very true it can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone it scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today note the repeated mixing of telephone scrabeling and encryption a demo of the above claim on an ordanary pots would be a good nights entertainment i suspect note also the many not all as the general tone implies this new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically at the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals the case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tightening of the current abuses i have not heard yet of a case that was impeaded by the use of secure encryption by the men in black the other side abuse by law enforcers is well documented even by govt agencies and the phone vs other coms is blurred yet again a key escrow system will be established to ensure that the clipper chip is used to protect the privacy of law abiding americans a key escrow system will be established to ensure that the clipper chip is used to protect the privacy of law abiding americans lets run that line twice not very carefully what it says the stated purpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of clipper compulsory note the word ensure as to protect or law abiding i will leave to you so to the person who asked if it included the outlawing of other encryptions the answer in this press release is yes each device containing the chip will have two unique keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device when the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two key escrow data bases that will be established by the attorney general access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap just as they only can wiretap now with a warrent the clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans just makes sure that the illegal ones are preserved to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the attorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices in addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings where do you find many experts any ex kgb people looking for a contract and as a later posting asks what of the stu iiis they already have it will be very interesting to see if the military and us embasies start to use it after all it is secure isn t it the govt will answer that point by its own actions the chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption s dual edge sword encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and terrorists we need the clipper chip and other approaches that can both provide law abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities in order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches like the key escrow system the president has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes again personal use seems to be a unaskable question the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens ah so warrents are not always needed it seems the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the national information infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of american industry in the global marketplace and the need of u s companies to manufacture and export high technology products the itars seem to slightly impeed this the president has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries the congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed the administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a national information infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give americans unprecedented access to information this infrastructure of high speed networks information superhighways will transmit video images hdtv programming and huge data files as easily as today s telephone system transmits voice note that all this wonderfull stuff will be in secret only the proper people will be able to express an opinion hence only the desired result will emerge since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use the administration is committed to policies that protect all americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law encryption and codes have been around for millenia they are generaly in equilibrium with the technology of the time the systematic study of cyphers has resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter at the moment i have no doubt that the factoring problem will fall in time probably fofr practical purposes by the middle of the next century further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet the provisions of the president s directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available for additional details call mat heyman national institute of standards and technology questions and answers about the clinton administration s telecommunications initiative q does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations a no clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans q suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device what would they have to do to decipher the message a they would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers the key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system q who will run the key escrow data banks a the two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities at this point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key escrow data banks it is a little hard to critisise a non proposal q how strong is the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security is a this system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today note we drop back to phone mode again if this is a true answer it can be rephrased as it sucks big time anyone who can drive the crypt work bench will use it for light amusement before breakfast while the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system this link between the security of the key eschrow and the actual algorithm is a real winner given that i have secret bit numbers could someone please explain how the details of an encryption algorithm will reveal them we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities just make sure you read the cvs real carfully ok q whose decision was it to propose this product a the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agencies were involved in this decision this approach has been endorsed by the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet officials quick with out looking back what name is missing from that list q who was consulted the congress industry a we have on going discussions with congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy we have briefed members of congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative the people who agree with us and who think there is a buck in it for them q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers a the government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them the reverse engineering provisions of the mask work act could be relevent here q who provides the clipper chip a mykotronx programs it at their facility in torrance california and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers the programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future q how do i buy one of these encryption devices a we expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the clipper chip into their devices you don t not unless you are one of the right people q if the administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices a this is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review the key escrow they missed the word secret here he needs a grammar lesson too mechanism will provide americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the administration is developing i would say less secure less conveniant more expensive pgp is free less available and more prone to being comprimised proofs to the contarary will be welcome note proof the administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have effectively done nor is the u s saying that every american as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product they don t seem to be saying anything that makes much sense and this proposal does prohibit it except in a very limited way and this is the one explicit reference to personal rights it is a denial and yes i don t think that the mexicans brazilians and canucks are included in clinton et als magnanamous gesture there is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either or proposition rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the clipper chip and similar encryption techniques the false tension is false the balance is between two repugnant points the right to privacy is hand waved to non existance by putting it behind the false assessment it is assumed that the removal of the right to take what ever steps you deem suitable to protect your privacy is non negotiable hence is defined in the govenment language to be non existant if you don t agree you must be a criminal as only criminals don t agree with out laws also note the non question if what is here was not possible q what does this decision indicate about how the clinton administration s policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration a it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public interest groups to find innovative ways to protect americans privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism it indicates we know that bush dropped the ball in squashing that nasty insert suitable retoric and will stamp out this disorderly unruley outbreak of freedom and ultra national sentiment q will the devices be exportable will other devices that use the government hardware a voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements case by case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices the same is true for other encryption devices one of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to u s companies operating at home and abroad with this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case by case basis for u s companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad we plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products this one is a real giggle in australia or france they will have to reveal the keys and the algorithm don t think it s at the top of my list of things i must have so the restrictions will protect me from saleks trying to sell me a bill of crock any for any others using it they must be nuts good luck folks paul
re more technical details the system or family key would appear to be cryptographically useless since every chip must know it and be able to remove its effects from the bitstream i daresay that it will be widely known almost immediately after this system is deployed and since it s been pointed out that there is not a separate decrypt key the same key is used for both encryption and decryption there goes any benefit to the use of a system wide key in skipjack robert bickford a hacker is any person who derives joy from rab well sf ca us discovering ways to circumvent limitations rab i recognize that a class of criminals and juvenile delinquents has taken to calling themselves hackers but i consider them irrelevant to the true meaning of the word just as the mafia calls themselves businessmen but nobody pays that fact any attention rab

the clipper chip a technical summary the following document summarizes the clipper chip how it is used how programming of the chip is coupled to key generation and the escrow process and how law enforcement decrypts communications since there has been some speculation on this news group about my own involvement in this project i d like to add that i was not in any way involved i found out about it when the fbi briefed me on thursday evening april since then i have spent considerable time talking with the nsa and fbi to learn more about this and i attended the nist briefing at the department of commerce on april the document below is the result of that effort dorothy denning the clipper chip a technical summary dorothy denning april introduction on april the president announced a new initiative that will bring together the federal government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement at the heart of the plan is a new tamper proof encryption chip called the clipper chip together with a split key approach to escrowing keys two escrow agencies are used and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key chip structure the clipper chip contains a classified bit block encryption algorithm called skipjack the algorithm uses bit keys compared with for the des and has rounds of scrambling compared with for the des it supports all des modes of operation throughput is mbits a second each chip includes the following components the skipjack encryption algorithm f an bit family key that is common to all chips n a bit serial number u an bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip encrypting with the chip to see how the chip is used imagine that it is embedded in the at t telephone security device as it will be suppose i call someone and we both have such a device after pushing a button to start a secure conversation my security device will negotiate a session key k with the device at the other end in general any method of key exchange can be used the key k and message stream m i e digitized voice are then fed into the clipper chip to produce two values e m k the encrypted message stream and e e k u n f a law enforcement block the law enforcement block thus contains the session key k encrypted under the unit key u concatenated with the serial number n all encrypted under the family key f chip programming and escrow all clipper chips are programmed inside a scif secure computer information facility which is essentially a vault the scif contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips about chips are programmed during a single session the scif is located at mikotronx at the beginning of a session a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault agent enters an bit value s into the laptop and agent enters an bit value s these values serve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers to generate the unit key for a serial number n the bit value n is first padded with a fixed bit block to produce a bit block n s and s are then used as keys to triple encrypt n producing a bit block r r e d e n s s s similarly n is padded with two other bit blocks to produce n and n and two additional bit blocks r and r are computed r e d e n s s s r e d e n s s s r r and r are then concatenated together giving bits the first bits are assigned to u and the second bits to u the rest are discarded the unit key u is the xor of u and u u and u are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies as a sequence of values for u u and u are generated they are written onto three separate floppy disks the first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part u the second disk is similar but contains the u values the third disk contains the unit keys u agent takes the first disk and agent takes the second disk the third disk is used to program the chips after the chips are programmed all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave the laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind the protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two the first two would provide the seeds s and s and the second two the escrow agents would take the disks back to the escrow agencies the escrow agencies have as yet to be determined but they will not be the nsa cia fbi or any other law enforcement agency one or both may be independent from the government law enforcement use when law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with clipper they will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the family key f this gives them e k u n they will then take a warrant identifying the chip serial number n to each of the key escrow agents and get back u and u u and u are xored together to produce the unit key u and e k u is decrypted to get the session key k finally the message stream is decrypted all this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder operated by the fbi acknowledgment and distribution notice all information is based on information provided by nsa nist and the fbi permission to distribute this document is granted
clipper and ranting libertarians i would think that you could reduce the defense of using non clipper based encryption technologies to defending freedom of expression ie free speech that you have to right to express whatever you want in whatever form your little heart desires so long as you do not impinge on the rights of others encrypted text sound video is just another form of expression of that particular text sound video just like digitized sound is another means of expression of sound streams of instead of continuous waveforms also it shouldn t be up to the government at all encryption standards can be decided upon by independent standards orgainizations apologies for the acronym one can note how well this has worked with iso and the metric system sae etc independent entities or consortia of people industries in that particular area are far more qualified to set standards than any one government agency consider for example what the ascii character set would have looked like if it was decided by the government i hope this helps folks to formulate their defenses i m still working on mine and hope to be faxing my congressmen soon d j hagberg hagberg ccit arizona edu finger for info and pgp public key
would clipper make a good cover for other encryption method clipper might be a good way to cover the use of another layer of encryption currently when you send an encrypted message an opponent can usually tell that you are using encryption which encryption method you are using because that information is usually in the clear with clipper most opponents will only know that you are sending clipper text they won t know that your clipper text is itself encoded only those few opponents who get your clipper keys will know that your message is double encrypted kind of like a safety deposit box containing a lock box so don t just think of replacements for clipper also think of front ends carl carl kadie i do not represent eff this is just me kadie eff org kadie cs uiuc edu
re text of white house announcement and q as on clipper chip encryption in article qnpjuinn ci gap caltech edu hal cco caltech edu hal finney writes brad clarinet com brad templeton writes their strategy is a business one rather than legal one they are pushing to get a standard in place a secret standard and if they get it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market it will be legal to sell better untapable encryption that doesn t have registered keys but it will be difficult and thus not a plan for most phone companies if brad s analysis is correct it may offer an explanation for why the encryption algorithm is being kept secret this will prevent competitors from coming out with clipper compatible phones which lack the government installed back door the strategy brad describes will only work as long as the only way to get compatible phones is to have ones with the government chips it would be nice from the point of view of personal privacy if brad turns out to be right as long as people still have the power to provide their own encryption in place of or in addition to the clipper privacy is still possible but the wording of several passages in the announcement makes me doubt whether this will turn out to be true even if what brad says turns out to be accurate you can bet that the administration will have made it very clear to the vendors that it would very much be in their best interests to institute a voluntary policy of refusing to sell anything but clinton cripple equipped equipment to anyone other than authorized government agencies and law enforcement or individuals and corporations who have been been determined by the administration to have a valid need on a case by case basis for an effective system note that this is very much like the language used in many gun control bills laws the administration is pushing for or otherwise supporting the logic and actual rationale as opposed to the excuses that get fed to the media is the same in both cases only the items or technology in question are different i think this is no accident it comes from the same philosophy that the government rules controls the people not the people controlling the government that the unconnected citizens are not sophisticated enough to know what is best for them so the government must tell the people what they need or do not need we know best and the idea that that a commoner can defend himself against government eavesdropping or unlawful attack is totally unacceptable to people with this outlook hal finney combine this all with pushing for national identity cards with smart chips to encode anything they please internal passport under the guise of streamlining the state people s health care system and with you can be certain more jewels yet to come and one sees an extremely ominous trend so what if will be ten years late it still is turning out to be an amazingly accurate prophecy unless a lot of people wake up and in a hurry one should always have every red warning light and bell and danger flag come up when the government seeks to set itself apart in regard to rights etc from the unconnected unprivileged citizen or should we now be saying subject instead why shouldn t the average person have a good secure system of data security not dependent on nebulous safeguards for maintaining that security why shouldn t the average person be able to defend himself from an agency gone rogue i am sure the feds could break into any data they really wanted to but it would take some work and using the same logic one should not be allowed to have a good safe unless a duplicate of the key s or combination are submitted for safekeeping by the government i don t really see a difference philosophically encrypted data sure won t evaporate not with such high tech tools as a tape recorder pat rwing uucp without prejudice ucc pat myrto seattle wa if all else fails try uunet pilchuck rwing pat wisdom only two things are infinite the universe and human stupidity and i am not sure about the former albert einstien

the escrow database here is a disturbing thought now we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets we live in the electronic age i asked myself how big could the escrow database get how hard might it be to steal the whole thing particularly were i an nsa official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow houses we can pretend that such will not happen but thats naive well lets see ten bytes of each escrow half lets asume ten bytes of serial number in fact i believe the serial number is smaller but this is an order of magnitude calculation we assume as the population and that each person has a key i get five gigabytes for each of the two escrow databases fits conveniently on a single very valuable exabyte tape this can only get easier with time but who cares i can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my pocket on two mm tapes admittely they will think of safeguards they won t put the whole database on one disk prehaps maybe they will throw stumbling blocks in the way this changes nothing they keys will be needed every day by hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types so convenience will dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval at some point with or without collusion by the agencies those exabyte tapes are going to get cut dorothy denning and david sternlight will doubtless claim this can t happen but we know that can t is a prayer not a word that in this instance connotes realism with two exabyte tapes in your pocket you would hold the keys for every person s conversations in the country in your hands yeah you need the master key two but thats just ten bytes of information that have to be stored an awful lot of places come to think of it even if the nsa getting a copy of the database isn t a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial political views consider foreign intelligence services you know the ones that david sternlight wants to protect us from because of the evil industrial espionage that they do the french apparently do have a big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial secrets so he isn t being completely irrational here although why our companies couldn t use cryptosystems without back doors is left unexplained by those that point out this threat presumably foreign intelligence services can get moles into the nsa and other agencies we have proof by example of this its happened many times presumably someday they will get their hands on some fraction of the keys you can t avoid that sort of thing don t pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on the escrow databases we crypto types are all taught something very important at the beginning of intro to cryptography security must depend on the easily changed key that you pick to run your system and not on a secret the escrow databases aren t the sorts of secrets that our teachers told us about but they are the sort of big secrets they would lump into this category imagine trying to replace million clipper chips i cannot believe that the nsa or whomever it is thats doing this doesn t realize all this already they are too smart there are too many of them who have made their bones in the real world i suspect that they know precisely what they are doing and that what they are doing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue to surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography i suspect that they realize that they can t put things off forever but they can try to delay things as long as possible who knows maybe even some of the higher ups the inevitable bureaucratic types that rise in any organization really do believe that this scheme might give people some security even as their subordinates in fort meade wring their hands over the foolishness of it all perry metzger pmetzger shearson com laissez faire laissez passer le monde va de lui meme

spoofing clipper serial number secrecy in clipper chip the serial number of the clipper chip is encrypted with the system key and transmitted as one part of a three part message presumably the protocol can be recovered if by nothing else differential analysis postulate if you will a chip or logic sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel the purpose of this chip is twofold transmit channel the spoof chip xors the bit encrypted serial number with a secondary keying variable this renders the serial number unrecoverable with just the system key recieve channel the spoof chip xors the incoming encrypted serial number with a secondary keying variable assuming the serial number is necessary for local operation this has the net result of hiding the serial number this gets more interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and a spoofed serial number without knowing the system key you could lie about the serial number but risk detection of the lie if you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the format of your own serial number makes you wonder whats being hidden here seems like the secrecy is to prevent you from lying about who you are
how large are commercial keys what are the typical sizes for keys for commercial secret key algorithms i know des is bits tripple des is bits and idea is bits is there anything made in the us that has bit keys anything anywhere that has larger keys i ve heard that rc can be scaled to arbitrarily large keys but is this actually implemented anywhere finally can anyone even concieve of a time place where bit keys aren t sufficient i certainly can t even at a trillion keys a second it would take about billion years to search just one billionth of that keys space thanks dane
re do we need the clipper for cheap security pmetzger snark shearson com perry e metzger writes if the clipper chip can do cheap crypto for the masses obviously one could do the same thing without building in back doors i agree so why is cylink the only and expensive game in town note i think cylink is great and if my boss would double my salary i d buy a bunch of their stuff one thing that clipper offers is interoperability at a higher degree of security than we currently have in non proprietary voice encryption systems this means it will be cheaper than anyone s proprietary scheme and easier to deploy this is of course either a bug or a feature depending on how you look at it indeed even without special engineering you can construct a good system right now a standard codec chip a chip to do vocoding a des chip a v bis integrated modem module and a small processor to do glue work are all you need to have a secure phone great where can i buy it another note if clipper increases the incentive to bring stronger encryption to the mass market all the better it s far overpriced at the moment yes cheap crypto is good but we don t need it from the government i don t care where we need to get it from i care where we can get it from and whether it will interoperate with everyone else indeed were it not for the government doing everything possible to stop them qualcomm would have designed strong encryption right in to the cdma cellular phone system they are pioneering were it not for the nsa and company cheap encryption systems would be everywhere as it is they try every trick in the book to stop it had it not been for them i m sure cheap secure phones would be out right now you can build them right now as long as you don t want to export a restriction i firmly oppose the only thing stopping people from making cheap encryption is greed they want a lock on the market they aren t the ones making cheap crypto available they are the ones keeping cheap crypto out of people s hands when they hand you a clipper chip what you are getting is a mess of pottage your prize for having traded in your birthright oh come on only if you trust it farther than it deserves a clipper phone is not a substitute for a cylink phone or a stu iii it s a substitute for the voice scramblers advertised in the back of radio electronics are we getting cheaper crypto for ourselves no because the market would have provided that on its own had they not deliberately sabotaged it i disagree modulo itar it s not the government that has sabotaged the market someone please tell me what exactly we get in our social contract in exchange for giving up our right to strong cryptography can you tell me where exactly we have given up that right amanda walker intercon systems corporation
clipper considered harmful if clipper comes to cellular phones along with legal proscriptions against using other cipher systems on these phones a new and potentially dangerous class of crime is created criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications specifically the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user and to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the device will be delayed once a suitable collection of devices is stolen criminals can communicate with impunity assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from key escrow until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means because life is cheap criminals are currently willing to kill people to steal very large and conspicuous property luxury cars it is reasonable to assume that they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous property a cipher cellular phone just as we have seen in the past with blue box technology and in the present with modified cellular phones we can expect to see among high stakes criminals a lucrative market for stolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days the high stakes criminals will pay the life is cheap types substantial amounts for stolen instruments because a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days a stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days there will be a continuing demand for fresh phones fresh bodies in other words clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn a current inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct vicious and persistent threat to the general public on the other hand if a criminal were to apply some arbitrary cipher to a device in a mostly non ciphered network the communication will at least stand out as being unusual and perhaps worthy of other means of investigation finally because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments there will exist strong motivation to record and archive all communications in the network for ex post facto scrutiny once some criminal act is discovered and the instruments involved have been identified while recording and archiving may not be feasible for wireline networks it is probably feasible across the more limited bandwidth of radio networks the existence of these recordings could open up vast potential for abuse brad yearwood brad optilink com uunet pyramid optilink brad petaluma ca

another key registration body bites the dust imho one of the candidates that has been suggested for a key registration body is the aclu i think this is poor choice the aclu is essentially a group of auditors they audit how people s civil liberties are administered traditionally auditors do not like to get involved in the design or operational aspects of things and with good reason when i was a systems programmer it always infuriated me that the auditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a security point of view but wouldn t tell us how to fix it i always figured they just liked to critcize without doing the work to help fix the problem then i took a stint as an auditor and i found out the real reason auditors don t like to recommend solutions because it puts them in a bad position if they have to criticize the implementation later the auditee can say well you told us this way would be ok it compromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor s job taking the case at hand suppose aclu becomes a key half registrar suppose that perhaps through some error on aclu s part a key half gets away that shouldn t and is used to deprive someone of her civil liberties the aclu gets wind of this and wants to take it to court but they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant and of the plaintiff which is not an easy position to be in there are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors at one place where i worked when payroll checks were printed they were signed automatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine this drum was kept by the auditors who also kept the check stock and was brought down to data processing when it was time to do the checks i believe the difference between this situation and the key registration situation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll checks if they were done yesterday and someone wants to do them again today he better be able to produce yesterday s checks so that they can be destroyed determining which of the many requests for key halves are legit is a trickier process one much more prone to mistakes that could put the aclu in a protecting the client versus protecting the aclu conflict of interest as always my opinions are my own lynn grant grant dockmaster ncsc mil

re facinating facts bit serial number possibly fixed s and s the only way to view this method of generating unit keys is as a back door what else can you call a key deterministically generated from the serial number to generate the unit key for a serial number n the bit value n is first padded with a fixed bit block to produce a bit block n s and s are then used as keys to triple encrypt n producing a bit block r r e d e n s s s similarly n is padded with two other bit blocks to produce n and n and two additional bit blocks r and r are computed r e d e n s s s r e d e n s s s r r and r are then concatenated together giving bits the first bits are assigned to u and the second bits to u the rest are discarded the unit key u is the xor of u and u u and u are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies what happens is that the need for the escrow houses is completely eliminated or should i say the need to access the escrow houses to decrypt the data the houses will still serve a real purpose as far as generating the illusion of protection and small town cops won t be let in on the secret so they will still go through the motions of going to the escrow houses but the fact is the federal government can and will build a chip which generates the unit keys from the encrypted serial number nuff said

re clipper considered harmful criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications specifically the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user and to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the device will be delayed why doing it in such a rough manner it is much more professional to steal the chip from the phone and even to replace it with a pin compatible do nothing chip that does not encrypt at all chances are that the victim will not notice anything especially if it is done professionally assuming that the bad guys can easily obtain substitute chips which don t cause any noticeable effect to either the user or the person at the other end of the line if there is any significant difficulty to obtaining such chips some of the criminals will decide to fall back on the murder kidnap method once a suitable collection of devices is stolen criminals can communicate with impunity assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from key escrow until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means no because the feds will still be able to decrypt the conversations true they ll blame the wrong guys but nevertheless one cannot say something like the drugs arrive tommorrow on the ship terminus when the feds are listening even if they cannot identify who the speaker is this assumes that the feds are tapping clipper phones belonging to ordinary citizens getting such a phone is the whole point of the crime under discussion to be sure i wouldn t put it past them but raising the possibility of such crime has the benefit of forcing the feds to either fess up about such intentions in advance or state that using clipper exposes the user to an additional criminal threat g no the criminals will just use some secure encryption the new proposal does not stop criminals it ensures that the government will be able to wiretap the average citizen and stops the casual snooper to me it also clearly looks as a step towards outlawing any other strong encryption devices agreed

re clipper considered harmful in article optilink com brad optilink com brad yearwood writes finally because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments there will exist strong motivation to record and archive all communications in the network for ex post facto scrutiny once some criminal act is discovered and the instruments involved have been identified it seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained i can even imagine this being found legal and constitutional since nothing is actually listened to until a valid warrant is issued and the keys are obtained imagine archiving all pay phone conversations so if someone turns out to be a drug dealer you can listen to all their past drug deals and archive calls to from suspected mafia members potential terrorists radicals etc imagine the convenience for the police of being able to get a warrant now and listening to all the calls the world trade center bombers made in the past year since archiving would be such a powerful tool and so easy to do why wouldn t it happen ken shirriff shirriff sprite berkeley edu
a little political philosophy worth reading read this through once or twice then replace prince with government or president as appropriate and read it again from chapter xx of the prince by n macchiavelli as translated by daniel donno in order to keep their lands secure some princes have disarmed their subjects others have prompted division within the cities they have subjugated some have nurtured animosities against themselves others have sought to win the approval of those they initially distrusted some have erected fortresses others have destroyed them now although it is impossible to set down definite judgements on all of these measures without considering the particular circumstances of the states where they may be employed i shall nevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself will allow to begin with there has never been a case of a new prince disarming his subjects indeed whenever he found them disarmed he proceeded to arm them for by arming your subjects you make their arms your own those among them who are suspicious become loyal while those who are already loyal remain so and from subjects they are transformed into partisans though you cannot arm them all nonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by extending privileges to those you arm your different treatment of the two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you while the former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties and dangers should receive advantages when you disarm your subjects however you offend them by showing that either from cowardliness or from lack of faith you distrust them and either conclusion will induce them to hate you moreover since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed you would have to resort to mercenaries whose limitations have already been discussed even if such troops were good however they could never be good enough to defend you from powerful enemies and doubtful subjects therefore as i have said a new prince in a newly acquired state has always taken measures to arm his subjects and history is full of examples proving that this is so but when a prince takes posession of a new state which he annexes as an addition to his original domain then he must disarm all the subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire it and these as time and occasion permit he must seek to render soft and weak he must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of the entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to his original domain and since the subject demands it i will not fail to remind any prince who has acquired a new state by the aid of its inhabitants that he soundly consider what induced them to assist him if the reason is not natural affection for him but rather dissatisfaction with the former government he will find it extremely difficult to keep them friendly for it will be impossible to please them if he will carefully think the matter through in the light of examples drawn from ancient and modern affairs he will understand why it is much easier to win the favor of those who were happy with their former government and hence were his enemies than to keep the favor of those who out of dissatisfaction with the former rule helped him to replace it

of the constitution and interpreted it in context if not please do so before posting this misinterpretation again it refers to the right of the people to organize a militia not for individuals to carry handguns grenades and assault rifles read it again yourself then re apply the admonition you gave to the previous poster to yourself as well the first clause is not a condition it is a reason for explicitly supporting the right which exists militia or not that the people have a right to keep and bear arms this is not a right granted by the constitution it is a right presumed to exist by default the constitution mentioning a right is to prevent the government from removing that right by stating very clearly the government shall not infringe mess with block limit that right remember the constitution is a bunch of negative things things the government cannot do all rights etc not epxressly given to the government go to the states and the people the same people the other amendments in the bill of rights talk about since i am sure you will summarily reject my interpretation i am appending a linguistic analysis by one far more expert than myself and you i suspect i am sure you will find his qualifications adequate if that isn t enough i can send you the senate subcommitee to the judiciary on the constitution report on the same thing there are some things in there that big brother types like biden etc must have really had to swallow hard to admit i think you will find that people that seriously study the constitution and state what it means will say the same thing those who come up with new improved meanings are those who are trying to subvert the constitution for a given agenda like clinton and his clinton cripple gun control people control and control control and the whole nasty mess please tell us how this person is in error won t you and please back it up with some proof since i am backing my assertion up with independent proof and have a bunch more i can

and if you wanted to know about desert warfare the man to call would be norman schwarzkopf no question about it but who would you call if you wanted the top expert on american usage to tell you the meaning of the second amendment to the united states constitution that was the question i asked a c brocki editorial coordinator of the los angeles unified school district and formerly senior editor at houghton mifflin publishers who himself had been recommended to me as the foremost expert on english usage in the los angeles school system mr brocki told me to get in touch with roy copperud a retired professor journalism at the university of southern california and the author of american usage and style the consensus a little research lent support to brocki s opinion of professor copperud s expertise roy copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades before embarking on a a distinguished year career teaching journalism at usc since copperud has been writing a column dealing with the professional aspects of journalism for editor and publisher a weekly magazine focusing on the journalism field he s on the usage panel of the american heritage dictionary and merriam webster s usage dictionary frequently cites him as an expert copperud s fifth book on usage american usage and style the consensus has been in continuous print from van nostrand reinhold since and is the winner of the association of american publisher s humanities award that sounds like an expert to me after a brief telephone call to professor copperud in which i introduced myself but did not give him any indication of why i was interested i sent the following letter i am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in english usage to analyze the text of the second amendment to the united states constitution and extract the intent from the text the text of the second amendment is a well regulated militia being necessary for the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed the debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the sentence a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause with respect to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed i would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issues of political impact or public policy but be restricted entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent further since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regarding the consequences of the second amendment i ask that whatever analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation and even be willing to testify under oath to support if necessary my letter framed several questions about the test of the second amendment then concluded i realize that i am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task with this letter i am doing so because as a citizen i believe it is vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the second amendment while i ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of its results i ask that you do this because of that importance after several more letters and phone calls in which we discussed terms for his doing such an analysis but in which we never discussed either of our opinions regarding the second amendment gun control or any other political subject professor copperud sent me the follow analysis into which i have inserted my questions for the sake of clarity copperud the words a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state contrary to the interpretation cited in your letter of july constitutes a present participle rather than a clause it is used as an adjective modifying militia which is followed by the main clause of the sentence subject the right verb shall the to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for maintaining a militia in reply to your numbered questions schulman can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep and bear arms solely to a well regulated militia copperud the sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear arms nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by others than the people it simply makes a positive statement with respect to a right of the people schulman is the right of the people to keep and bear arms granted by the words of the second amendment or does the second amendment assume a preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms and merely state that such right shall not be infringed copperud the right is not granted by the amendment its existence is assumed the thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia schulman is the right of the people to keep and bear arms conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia is in fact necessary to the security of a free state and if that condition is not existing is the statement the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed null and void copperud no such condition is expressed or implied the right to keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence of a militia no condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well regulated militia as a requisite to the security of a free state the right to keep and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence schulman does the clause a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state grant a right to the government to place conditions on the right of the people to keep and bear arms or is such right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence copperud the right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional as previously stated it is invoked here specifically for the sake of the militia schulman which of the following does the phrase well regulated militia mean well equipped well organized well drilled well educated or subject to regulations of a superior authority copperud the phrase means subject to regulations of a superior authority this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian control over the military schulman if at all possible i would ask you to take account the changed meanings of words or usage since that sentence was written years ago but not take into account historical interpretations of the intents of the authors unless those issues can be clearly separated copperud to the best of my knowledge there has been no change in the meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment if it were written today it might be put since a well regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged schulman as a scientific control on this analysis i would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the second amendment to the following sentence a well schooled electorate being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and read books shall not be infringed my questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the words modify each other identical to the second amendment s sentence and could this sentence be interpreted to restrict the right of the people to keep and read books only to a well educated electorate for example registered voters with a high school diploma copperud your scientific control sentence precisely parallels the amendment in grammatical structure there is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the possibility of a restricted interpretation professor copperud had only one additional comment which he placed in his cover letter with well known human curiosity i made some speculative efforts to decide how the material might be used but was unable to reach any conclusion so now we have been told by one of the top experts on american usage what many knew all along the constitution of the united states unconditionally protects the people s right to keep and bear arms forbidding all governments formed under the constitution from abridging that right as i write this the attempted coup against constitutional government in the soviet union has failed apparently because the will of the people in that part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the old guard s desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power and here in the united states elected lawmakers judges and appointed officials who are pledged to defend the constitution of the united states ignore marginalize or prevaricate about the second amendment routinely american citizens are put in american prisons for carrying arms owning arms of forbidden sorts or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements regarding the owning and carrying of firearms all of which is an abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms guaranteed by the constitution and even the american civil liberties union aclu staunch defender of the rest of the bill of rights stands by and does nothing it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to preserve that right no one else will no one else can will we beg our elected representatives not to take away our rights and continue regarding them as representing us if they do will we continue obeying judges who decide that the second amendment doesn t mean what it says it means but means whatever they say it means in their orwellian doublespeak or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our

re do we need the clipper for cheap security in article r f rh news intercon com amanda intercon com amanda walker writes one thing that clipper offers is interoperability at a higher degree of security than we currently have in non proprietary voice encryption systems this means it will be cheaper than anyone s proprietary scheme and easier to deploy i may be an anarchist nutcase but i wouldn t have frothed overmuch had the government proposed a secure encryption standard in fact if the nsa had come up with a privacy chip rather than a wiretap chip i would have been happy they could have done this set up an ansi committee picked a secure cryptosystem defined a protocol and interface and said hey start building them instead we have a deliberately brain dead version of a cryptosystem that has not even been peer reviewed yes the nsa owns some smart people but if they pulled a feal well at t is going to be left with a lot of dud phones on its hands perry said someone please tell me what exactly we get in our social contract in exchange for giving up our right to strong cryptography can you tell me where exactly we have given up that right heh heh the government already gave it up for us remember in the announcement they described this scheme as balancing the two extremes of having no privacy and claiming that citizens had a constitutional right to encryption so much for clinton s support of the right of privacy pgp key by finger or e mail void when prohibited eli ebrandt jarthur claremont edu

theoretical aspects of cryptology it is anticipated that some talks may also be presented by special invitation of the program committee instructions for authors authors are requested to send copies of a detailed abstract not a full paper by april to the program chair at the address given below a limit of pages of pt type not counting the bibliography or the title page is placed on all submissions submissions must arrive on time or be postmarked no later than april and sent by airmail in order to receive consideration by the program committee it is required that submissions start with a succinct statement of the problem addressed the solution proposed and its significance to cryptology appropriate for a non specialist reader technical development directed to the specialist should follow as needed abstracts that have been submitted to other conferences that have proceedings are not eligible for submission submissions must be anonymous this means that names and affiliations of authors should only appear on the title page of the submission it should be possible to remove this page and send the papers to program committee members a latex style file that

re clipper considered harmful in article optilink com brad optilink com brad yearwood writes if clipper comes to cellular phones along with legal proscriptions against using other cipher systems on these phones a new and potentially dangerous class of crime is created aside from possession of terrorist tools unapproved encryption devices or programs criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications specifically the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user and to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the device will be delayed once a suitable collection of devices is stolen criminals can communicate with impunity assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from key escrow until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means because life is cheap criminals are currently willing to kill people to steal very large and conspicuous property luxury cars it is reasonable to assume that they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous property a cipher cellular phone just as we have seen in the past with blue box technology and in the present with modified cellular phones we can expect to see among high stakes criminals a lucrative market for stolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days the high stakes criminals will pay the life is cheap types substantial amounts for stolen instruments because a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days a stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days there will be a continuing demand for fresh phones fresh bodies and since clinton is also going full bore to deny unconnected citizens the means to defend themselves we will protect you is good enough for you by perverting or trashing the second amendment the targeted individuals will be guaranteed easy prey what is a few bodies compared to the greater good of the fed being able to defeat a citizen s security with impunity you don t think there doesn t exist a means by which the nsa can do their usual eavesdropping scanning for keywords with or without a court order or any keys do you if so i got some great florida real estate you might be interested in perhaps the idea of escrowed keys is meant to divert the discussion to how they will be safeguarded and away from the basic fact that the government is systematically taking away our right to privacy to be secure for the means of self defense and just about every other right spelled out in the bill of rights nawwww they are the government trust us in other words clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn a current inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct vicious and persistent threat to the general public what is more important to the government law enforcement people control or the safety of the general public the gun control issue should answer that one look at how good that works in making cities safer the places that are the worst in that regard are also the places with the best gun control government is not about public good it is about control never forget that our founding fathers sure were concerned about it remainder deleted pat rwing uucp without prejudice ucc pat myrto seattle wa if all else fails try uunet pilchuck rwing pat wisdom only two things are infinite the universe and human stupidity and i am not sure about the former albert einstien

re an open letter to mr clinton in article vkcsbl mbeckman mbeckman com mbeckman mbeckman com writes as an economist i m sure you can see the flaws in this logic if the naive market is flooded with proprietary but weak encryption then truly strong encryption will be unable to compete this is true for the mass market but not for those who need strong crypto and are willing to pay the price after all one can buy strong crypto today if one is willing to spend enough thus the concern is not economic the issue most worth worrying about is that after the system takes hold the government will outlaw other systems and something voluntary will become the only system available that is a political not an economic issue as a separate matter you may be making an implied advocacy for cheap secure crypto for everyone it s true that the clipper chip would probably prevent that except via clipper but cheap secure crypto for everyone is a political discussion not an economic one and the whole point of clipper is to resolve that political policy tension between securing legitimate communications and tapping the crooks david sternlight great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of our information errors and omissions excepted

re clipper chip and crypto key escrow excerpts from the clipper announcement with some questions the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens q suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device what would they have to do to decipher the message a they would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers the key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system in these two sections the phrases or other legal order and normally a court order imply there is some other way or ways of doing a legal wiretap what is are these how do they affect the way people who trust the system of court orders to protect them feel about this escrow system the second section shows the sequence of events the law enforcer armed with his warrant attaches his headphones to the line with his croc clips remember these are the folk who couldn t cope with digital telephony and hears a load of modem like tones we are talking analogue telephony here what next what modulation scheme do these clipper boxes use is it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained i thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some intermediate point on the line maybe they have taken a crash course in data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the digital stream for decryption later this would still suffer from the same problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would not be at one end of the line if calls can t be recorded for decryption later it would be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of clipper units these are supposed to be cheap mass market items and using them in turn how tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors these things are proposed for use by us corporations to secure their foreign offices where phone line quality may well be poor it seems hard enough to me to get digitised speech of any quality into something a modem can handle without having to add lots of error correction to keep the decryption in sync q will the devices be exportable will other devices that use the government hardware a voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements one of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to u s companies operating at home and abroad with this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case by case basis for u s companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad this raises an intersting question in the uk here it is illegal to connect anything to a public telecomms network without it being approved by a body called babt it has been stated either here or in the uk telecom group that they will not approve equipment that does encryption i don t know if this is true or not but this would make a good test case perhaps friendly countries and the uk may still qualify will get to fish in the escrowed key pool as well peter ilieve peter memex co uk

new encryption as promised i spoke today with the company mentioned in a washington times article about the clipper chip announcement the name of the company is secure communicatiions technology information will be given at the end of this message on how to contact them basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that we are more specifically however mr bryen of secure communications brought to light many points that might interest most of the readers his belief is that at t was made known of the clipper well before the rest of the industry this is for several reasons several of which are a company of at t s size could never be able to make a decision to use the new chip on the same day it was announced months ago they proposed using their own chip for at t s secure telephone devices at t basically blew them off as being not interested at all this stuck them as strange until now also i spoke with art melnick their cryptographer he expressed several concerns over the new clipper chip the obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto system is lost forever these keys can end up in the hands of any agency of the government the fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm is vulnerable over time to an attacker the classified algorithm may hide another backdoor but he feels that it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers or changing the keys themselves additionally he feels that the nsa has probably spent enough time and money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed engineered that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very difficult to do he feels that they have developed a suitable technique to protect the chip from this attack also he feels that the chip is hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip additonally i spoke with mr melnick about their algorithm he couldn t tell me much about their new agorithm because it hasn t been patented yet however he told me a little the algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been granted for it this is so the crypto community can see that it is secure the algorithm is called nea for new encryption algorithm the details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret until the patent was issued but i was told that it will incorporate the following it will have fast encryption of data exact specs not given but mr melnick stated much faster than what an rs can put out it is a symmetric cipher just like idea and des it will use bit data blocks for encryption like des and idea the key length was not given to me but mr melnick states that it is adujustable and is more than adequate for security the algorithm is written in c and assembler in software form and can be ported to many platforms unlike the the clipper chip which is hardware only and cannot be made into software this i consider a definite plus for the nea for widespread use the algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques such as rsa or diffie hellman this will also be supported in the hardware chip right now the projected cost of the nea chip will be about dollars for each clipper will run each chip that is if it is produced enough which probably won t happen they currently sell a program called c com that uses the algorithm and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted data into blocks this could prevent plaintext attacks if you know what the block header is this program operates at all supported rs speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm most importantly it does not have a backdoor right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out of business this is a very real possibility so they really need help in stopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard if you want to contact them they can be reached at secure communications technology georgia ave suite silver spring md i talked to mr bryen who represents the company he can answer any questions you have any factual errors occurring in this write up are my own and i apologize for them ahead of time psionic wam umd edu fight the wiretap chip ask me how c craig h rowland amiga pgp key available those who would give up liberty for by request security deserve neither a

revised technical summary of clipper chip here is a revised version of my summary which corrects some errors and provides some additional information and explanation the clipper chip a technical summary dorothy denning revised april introduction on april the president announced a new initiative that will bring together the federal government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement at the heart of the plan is a new tamper proof encryption chip called the clipper chip together with a split key approach to escrowing keys two escrow agencies are used and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key chip contents the clipper chip contains a classified single key bit block encryption algorithm called skipjack the algorithm uses bit keys compared with for the des and has rounds of scrambling compared with for the des it supports all des modes of operation the algorithm takes clock ticks and in electronic codebook ecb mode runs at mbits per second each chip includes the following components the skipjack encryption algorithm f an bit family key that is common to all chips n a bit serial number this length is subject to change u an bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip the chips are programmed by mykotronx inc which calls them the myk the silicon is supplied by vlsi technology inc they are implemented in micron technology and will initially sell for about each in quantities of or more the price should drop as the technology is shrunk to micron encrypting with the chip to see how the chip is used imagine that it is embedded in the at t telephone security device as it will be suppose i call someone and we both have such a device after pushing a button to start a secure conversation my security device will negotiate an bit session key k with the device at the other end this key negotiation takes place without the clipper chip in general any method of key exchange can be used such as the diffie hellman public key distribution method once the session key k is established the clipper chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream m digitized voice the telephone security device feeds k and m into the chip to produce two values e m k the encrypted message stream and e e k u n f a law enforcement field which are transmitted over the telephone line the law enforcement field thus contains the session key k encrypted under the unit key u concatenated with the serial number n all encrypted under the family key f the law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed the ciphertext e m k is decrypted by the receiver s device using the session key d e m k k m chip programming and escrow all clipper chips are programmed inside a scif secure compartmented information facility which is essentially a vault the scif contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips about chips are programmed during a single session the scif is located at mykotronx at the beginning of a session a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault agent enters a secret random bit value s into the laptop and agent enters a secret random bit value s these random values serve as seeds to generate unit keys for a sequence of serial numbers thus the unit keys are a function of secret random bits where each agent knows only to generate the unit key for a serial number n the bit value n is first padded with a fixed bit block to produce a bit block n s and s are then used as keys to triple encrypt n producing a bit block r r e d e n s s s similarly n is padded with two other bit blocks to produce n and n and two additional bit blocks r and r are computed r e d e n s s s r e d e n s s s r r and r are then concatenated together giving bits the first bits are assigned to u and the second bits to u the rest are discarded the unit key u is the xor of u and u u and u are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies as a sequence of values for u u and u are generated they are written onto three separate floppy disks the first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part u the second disk is similar but contains the u values the third disk contains the unit keys u agent takes the first disk and agent takes the second disk thus each agent walks away knowing an bit seed and the bit key parts however the agent does not know the other bits used to generate the keys or the other bit key parts the third disk is used to program the chips after the chips are programmed all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave the laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind the protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two the first two would provide the seeds s and s and the second two the escrow agents would take the disks back to the escrow agencies the escrow agencies have as yet to be determined but they will not be the nsa cia fbi or any other law enforcement agency one or both may be independent from the government law enforcement use when law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the clipper chip the law enforcement field is first decrypted with the family key f giving e k u n documentation certifying that a tap has been authorized for the party associated with serial number n is then sent e g via secure fax to each of the key escrow agents who return e g also via secure fax u and u u and u are xored together to produce the unit key u and e k u is decrypted to get the session key k finally the message stream is decrypted all this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder capstone the next generation a successor to the clipper chip called capstone by the government and myk by mykotronx has already been developed it will include the skipjack algorithm the digital signature standard dss the secure hash algorithm sha a method of key exchange a fast exponentiator and a randomizer a prototoype will be available for testing on april and the chips are expected to be ready for delivery in june or july acknowledgment and distribution notice this article is based on information

re estimating wiretap costs benefits in article apr kronos arc nasa gov hanson kronos arc nasa gov robin hanson writes a rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million dollars per year to u s law enforcement agencies in u s wiretaps led to arrests while total police expenditures of billion led to million arrests ref us statistical abstracts i m working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately but you seem to be assuming that all arrests are of equal value and that the use of wiretaps is spread uniformly among them given this comparatively tiny number of wiretaps and the associated difficulty and cost involved judges technicians etc i expect that law enforcement reserves the use of wiretaps for the most valuable cases since the value of an arrest can vary over an enormous range eg jaywalking mass murder i think your million estimate may be too low by a couple of orders of magnitude

re secret algorithm re clipper chip and crypto key escrow after reading the debate over the clipper i have a few things to add first most of the people i know who activly use encryption privately do not care about most of the issues that surround this debate and any questions about what is or is not ok to use in the us all they care about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not that after all is the bottom line second if i look at all the people i know who use any form of encryption at all and this group spans people from the morons who still insist that the des is a good and secure standard to people looking at trying to improve upon existing strategies i can not think of anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaves their methods open to abuse the clipper does this because people make mistakes by nature and the us government is made up of people who are just as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else third since most of the people i know are at least marginaly familiar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption stratigies i can t see how most of them are going to blindly trust that someone will not figure out a good way to compromise the clipper chip that despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it so i can not see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip fourth when it comes to criminal abuse sure there are many stupid people out there and yes some will be open to being caught via the built in back door of the clipper chip however anyone who is going to do any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is going to run into that problem pretty damned fast and i would assume start looking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption if nothing else were avalible none of this would be an issue however the truth is that most private encryption users that i ve ever run into simply do not give a damn about the legal status of rsa or pgp or anything else if it works they use it this is not going to change either i do not think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be slowed down by the advent of the clipper chip it is all to easy to convert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is if anything the clipper chip just adds another tool to the user the bottom line here is that people will use what works and unavoidibly i m sure most criminals would rather face an encryption related charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty charges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy the other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide useage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is out of the bag or if you have an interest in snooping pandora s box has been opened and this is not going to change i ve seen a blindness to this that i ve found utterly stunning and the clipper chip along with the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a larger degree sincerly tim scanlon tfs gravity gmu edu

will feds troll for mutilated law enforcement blocks from denning the skipjack encryption algorithm f an bit family key that is common to all chips n a bit serial number u an bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip e m k the encrypted message stream and e e k u n f a law enforcement block where the session key is k and is transmitted encrypted in the unit key u which along with the serial number n is encrypted in the family key f presumably the protocol can be recovered if by nothing else differential analysis postulate if you will a chip or logic sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel the function of this spoof chip is twofold transmit channel the spoof chip xors the bit encrypted serial number with a secondary keying variable this renders the serial number unrecoverable with just the family key receive channel the spoof chip xors the incoming encrypted serial number with a secondary keying variable assuming integrity of the law enforcement block is necessary for local operation checksums sequence control etc this has the net result of hiding the serial number it is probable theere is a known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing n bits as used in generating u u u correctness of the law enforcement block can be determined with only the family key f whereas no one has proposed federal agencies be denied f and because they could recover it themselves the correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bits of n in e n f the one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above but the mutilation could be detected a better approach would be to mutilate the entire law enforcement block if it were done with a group encryption scheme such as des or presumably skipjack the chances the law enforcement block can be recovered are lessened what do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the serial numbers decrypted in a target search when digital transmission becomes widely available would there be a requirement that clipper protocol transmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks one way to avoid notice would be to spoof protocol information of the block containing m as well as spoofing the law enforcement block the goal is to use a secure communications scheme without redress to detection or key k interception contained encrypted within the law enforcement block the data stream is returned to its original state for use by the clipper chip or system if required for proper operation it is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within the clipper chip yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for requiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting and decrypting e m k the spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols including on the resulting serial data stream existing clipper products could be subborned after all they are high security encryption systems right super encipherment encryption could allow the chip to be used without redress to detection of the use of the chip or disclosure of the serial number security must be adequate to deny the serial number which should not be recoverable by other means one can see the use of cut outs for procurring clipper phones or once the number of units is high enough stealing them it would be a mistake on the part of authority but nice from a point of privacy if the serial number n were not associated with a particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and distribution process hopefully the list of known missing or stolen clipper serial numbers n encrypted with f and the protocols are not sufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream this could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypted stream detection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned scheme if you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own and use them in a codebook sustitution with your own where they point to a valid law enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matching the remainder of the transmission you could simply out and out lie yet deliver to monitoring and or hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcement block these captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators such as in a manually keyed encryption system fending this off would require escalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission the m code stream might be independently attacked based on knowledge of clipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext this could be invalidated by changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper m stream and the actual transmitted stream under the control of a secure key generator synchronized between endpoints the useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited based on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission interception you would need a large number of them but hey there s supposed to be millions of these things right adding time stamps to the encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical who wants an encryption chip with a real time clock the entire idea of the law enforcement block can be invalidated

political point of attack clipper infrastructure my earlier argument that clipper will encourage state and local cops to commit criminal acts is largely moot now that we ve learned that the fbi will perform the actual tap it will encourage the fbi to commit even more criminal acts but that s not the point here but this gives another avenue of attack on the clipper proposal when the eff aclu cpsr foia requests are made they should ask for details on the bureaucratic and equipment infrastructure that is proposed or even already budgeted for the fbi to service tapping requests for now and the projected future from these figures estimate the number of clipper tap requests the fbi is expecting publish this figure compare it on a per capita basis with the amount of tapping now known or suspected also estimate how expensive it would be for the fbi to install more clipper tapping stations and how rapidly they could be built and installed ie get the plus or minus epsilon for the near future might be a mite disturbing for j q public to know these things and despite all the technical details btw thanks to those who ve been providing them we still don t know how the tapping requests will be transmitted and authenticated though it isn t too hard to guess a good scheme how the results will be securely transmitted fed ex the audio tapes how privacy will be re established when an investigation is complete dwight tuinstra best tuinstra sandman ece clarkson edu tolerable tuinstrd craft camp clarkson edu homo sapiens planetary cancer news at six

re clipper and ranting libertarians just a little nitpicking wasn t it the government that required a standard railway gauge didn t that improve things please don t misunderstand i m utter suspicious of this clipper chip why hold the design top secret was this a work around the law that says that any discoveries made by people working for the government is public domain e g nih class library etc des has its designs published all over the place and it is considered fairly strong although could be stronger ants
fear uncertainty doubt i suspect that the decisive element in the political battle will be the fud fear uncertainty doubt factor if the people who would be end users of the cripple chip hear of the whole debate only vaguely the government says it s solid other people in the field say it s swiss cheese the balance of doubt could shift against the feds any attempt to limit other forms of encryption could then be presented as the government covering its own butt by protecting its poor product from superior competition comments

public awareness wasre text of white house announcement and q as on clipper chip encryption in article rwing uucp pat rwing uucp pat myrto writes i think this is no accident it comes from the same philosophy that the government rules controls the people not the people controlling the government that the unconnected citizens are not sophisticated enough to know what is best for them so the government must tell the people what they need or do not need we know best and the idea that that a commoner can defend himself against government eavesdropping or unlawful attack is totally unacceptable to people with this outlook combine this all with pushing for national identity cards with smart chips to encode anything they please internal passport under the guise of streamlining the state people s health care system and with you can be certain more jewels yet to come and one sees an extremely ominous trend so what if will be ten years late it still is turning out to be an amazingly accurate prophecy unless a lot of people wake up and in a hurry one should always have every red warning light and bell and danger flag come up when the government seeks to set itself apart in regard to rights etc from the unconnected unprivileged citizen or should we now be saying subject instead why shouldn t the average person have a good secure system of data security not dependent on nebulous safeguards for maintaining that security why shouldn t the average person be able to defend himself from an agency gone rogue i am sure the feds could break into any data they really wanted to but it would take some work and using the same logic one should not be allowed to have a good safe unless a duplicate of the key s or combination are submitted for safekeeping by the government i don t really see a difference philosophically encrypted data sure won t evaporate not with such high tech tools as a tape recorder the average amerikan today seems to think that the government should be able to eavesdrop on everyone else opinion polls show that most people belive the bill of rights to grant too much freedom to people when it is not identified as such btw if anyone knows of a cite for that i d love to have it not only does this mean that these people are willing to give up everyone else s rights they don t even know what the bill of rights actually says how can we show the average person not the average usenet reader that people are actually entitiled to these rights so many people don t care if the government is taking more and more control of us all a little at a time if there was some sort of awareness of what the government is trying to do by a majority of the us population just think about what could be accomplished but there are so many that trust unthinkingly in whatever the media and government tell them
ideas on clipper i have an idea as to why the encryption algorithm needs to be keep secret and some things that i think it implies of course these could all be wrong from the clipper chip a technical summary dorothy denning revised april the clipper chip contains a classified single key bit block encryption algorithm called skipjack the algorithm uses bit keys compared with for the des and has rounds of scrambling compared with for the des it supports all des modes of operation the algorithm takes clock ticks and in electronic codebook ecb mode runs at mbits per second each chip includes the following components the skipjack encryption algorithm f an bit family key that is common to all chips n a bit serial number this length is subject to change u an bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip encrypting with the chip to see how the chip is used imagine that it is embedded in the at t telephone security device as it will be suppose i call someone and we both have such a device after pushing a button to start a secure conversation my security device will negotiate an bit session key k with the device at the other end this key negotiation takes place without the clipper chip in general any method of key exchange can be used such as the diffie hellman public key distribution method once the session key k is established the clipper chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream m digitized voice the telephone security device feeds k and m into the chip to produce two values e m k the encrypted message stream and e e k u n f a law enforcement field which are transmitted over the telephone line the law enforcement field thus contains the session key k encrypted under the unit key u concatenated with the serial number n all encrypted under the family key f the law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed suppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the n for my chip but did not know f then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine f from if law enforcement field e e k u n f not knowing n would might make this much harder now suppose that i know f either legitimately or not if i know k either because i am involved in the conversation or i know u for a party in the conversation i may now be able to determine u for the other party if i know f i can also defeat the law enforcement field since i could make my own with a different k then the one i am using knowing f also allows traffic analysis to be performed so i might not know what you are saying but i could know who you are saying it too now i admit that someone trying to compute u will not have lots of messages to work from but since we have no way of knowing that the key generation method does not deliberately generate weak keys or for that matter that the published method is in fact used perhaps the u s will be chosen from know weak keys for the system obviously the compromise of f would be a disaster both to law enforcement for whom this whole thing is designed and for the people who believe that it is giving them security f is but one number and i sure that alot of people more then know what it is and if some panel of experts is going to check it over for flaws then many more will know f forget grinding chips bribery and blackmail work just fine so am i wrong or are these problems jon

re organized lobbying for cryptography in article c uprt gmq dcs ed ac uk pdc dcs ed ac uk paul crowley writes perhaps these encryption only types would defend the digitized porn if it was posted encrypted these issues are not as seperable as you maintain in fact since effective encryption makes censorship impossible they are almost the same issue and they certainly fall into the brief of the eff it also falls within the purview of the aclu but that doesn t mean the aclu or the eff would be the most effective instrument to win the hearts and minds in favor of access to cryptography it s precisely slogans like cryptography makes censorship impossible which stand to torpedo any attempt to generate a broad consensus in favor of encryption it is not true and in the context of a public debate it would be a dangerous red herring advocates of strong crypto had better prepare themselves to answer such charges in pragmatic terms that laypeople and politicians can sympathize with the usual mumblings about constitutional amendments are not enough tal kubo math harvard edu

re would clipper make a good cover for other encryption method from brad optilink com brad yearwood assume in this case the usual canard adversary of narcotraficantes they probably have more cash than the kgb did and they re probably more generous at handing it out it will be easier than ever to find or cultivate walkers and pollards for the keys and it will be easy enough to find someone to reverse engineer the chip unless the tamper proofing is damned clever and effective if the administration really believes big time drug dealers are the threat personally i thought it was the cia and the air force that did all the real drug shipping then they ought to take this seriously unlike the kgb drug dealers can make a most convincing argument for cooperation help us and we ll be nice and give you some money don t help us and we ll start cutting off your favourite body parts after all it was probably an argument like that that persuaded jack ruby to shoot oswald in full view of the police life in jail probably seems much more preferable to most people than several weeks of something nasty followed by no life at all g

re is key escrow enough the points raised about checking what is actually in the chip as opposed to what is allegedly programmed therein raise yet another trust issue even if we assume that these trusted agents are really entering a wide range of s and s seeds rather than using the same one all the time to reduce the key search space to bits i assume they are not doing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry at carefully selected points to encode data they would presumably be punching numbers into a computer which for all they know could program the chips in a manner completely independent of the s and s values they are feeding into the system s and s are clearly the backdoor we should assume they are all compromised if they re not compromisable why the hell not use a hardware true random number source there isn t a random number source anywhere in this proposal the whole thing is deterministic from the day the serial number is stamped on the chip nope it can t be trusted this is all about two levels of access the possibly honest key escrow that police forces have to use and ostensibly the fbi and the back door that lets the nsa decode everything on the fly and maybe some back handers to the fbi when they want a warrantless tab in exchange for favours g
re do we need the clipper for cheap security there are chips which perform the voice compression expansion they can t be expensive because they exist in many phones connected to pbxs or on the pbx line cards as well as in a lot of equipment which compresses voice grade circuits to save the cost of long distance leased t s or satellite circuits i can t remember the generic term for these chips my impression is that this was a big deal years ago but circuits have gotten so cheap that it isn t done much now codecs they have to get about compression on bit samples to squeeze them down v bis i played around with the lossless shorten program last night but it only managed i ve got some specimen celp code but it s not obvious that it runs in real time i think it s just proof of concept code and i have some mucking about with file formats to do before i can put my own sample through it looks like the current option is to use a voice mail modem with built in dsp chip to do this in hardware that means two modems for a system putting the cost at upwards ouch maybe soon we ll be able to do it in software on high powered games consoles isn t the do an acorn risc machine inside that cpu runs like shit off a shovel and will be nicely mass market too g

re help with ultra long timing thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and i am looking at using a couple of the ideas i recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil spec version of exar s xr timer counter chip it is stable down to c and sucks very little power they show an application for a ultra long time delay up to several years depending on the rc time constant in this application they have two of them cascaded together the reset and trigger pins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is disabled in this configuration the output is high when the system is reset when triggered the output goes low and stays that way for a total of x the timing cycle of the first chip the total timing cycle of the two chips can be programmed from to x r x c to x r x c in steps by selecting any combination of the counter outputs to the timer output the beauty of it is the timebase chip would only have to have a uf timing cap and a k resistor for seconds per timing cycle so i can get a maximum of seconds between timing cycles x or about days of course that s much more than i need days but the counter allows for binary steps that can be selected for the output for the pellet puker after the first days and it trips it would reset its self for the next day timing cycle and so forth power is still a problem though a few ideas that you suggested was to bury the electronics in a hole dug in the snow as an insulator and put the pellet puker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to keep a charge on a lithium battery pack i like that idea this thing has to work for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are volts to spit the pellets out onto the snow anyway i ordered the xr s to see what i can do with them should be interesting as long as i m not the one that has to go digging up the pellets in the middle of antartica freezing my buns off thanks again everyone wes

re help with ultra long timing in article apr kuhub cc ukans edu wellison kuhub cc ukans edu writes i have a project that was drooped in my lap that is somewhat a pain to design what i am looking for is a stable ultra long solid state timer what they want to do is to place this thing on the antartic ice shelf and measure the amount of snow fall over a period of six weeks every two weeks they want to trip a selonoid to discharge different colored pellets by gas pressure out across the snow then by digging down into the snow the snow fall amount can be measured as they come to the different color pellets the problem is trying to build a timer that would stand the cold degrees and a power source that wouldn t drain i have looked at the xr timers and the standard ne dual timers but thier temp specs won t go that low also two weeks equates to seconds per firing which means one big timing cap i have found farad yes farad caps that have a working voltage of volts and are small in size but again the time of discharge at or lower degrees isn t linear i was thinking of using several timers chained together to fire the selonid at the end of the timing period but that blasted cold and the drain on a battery over six weeks is the pain one possibility would be to use solar panels but this is during the six month twilight anyone have any good ideas thanks in advance wes firstly i would never consider trying to make a one shot timer your f cap will have been designed as a ram battery substitute rather than for use in applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current their performance in some respects is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap the other point is that big electro s are usually rated with tolerances so calculating exactly what capacitance you have particularly when considering the cold you should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain that rolls over from zero to maximum count or vice versa once every seconds if you were to use something like a hz clock you would need a divider chain of to give an error of less than one percent in the firing times over the six week period of course you could trim the hz oscillator to give you exact time but the likelyhood of the oscillator remaining exactly constant at is low anyway i would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit caveat i m not experienced in low temperature electronics so i can t guarantee that this or any other approach is the best for inhospitable conditions johnh electronics department school of mpce macquarie university sydney australia email johnh mpce mq edu au ph fax

voltage multiplier problem hi i ve just built a valve preamp and use a diode capacitor voltage multiplier to step the vac supply voltage up to approx vdv as the load resistance increases the rc constant decreases and hence the output voltage drops i need as high an output voltage as possible about v the circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages ie diodes and capacitors each capacitor develops about v across them and i take the output from across seven capacitors v each capacitor is mfd at v if i increase each of the capacitors rating mfd that will increase the rc constant and hence alleviate some of the problem these capacitors are going to be a little expensive as i need of them so what would happen if i connected a mfd at v capacitor in parallel with the output and hence in parallel with the seven mfd capacitors will it as i assume increase the c in circuit and hence increase the rc time constant if it does and my output voltage becomes more stable by doing this then i will have killed two birds with one stone as i am experiencing some hz ripple and hence amp hum and this new capacitor will smooth this out and can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor choke to be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out the hz mains hum lowest resistance possible i ve not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is too much of a distraction i m at university and i ve got to get my dissertation finished in two weeks hence i m mailing not playing with my solderoing iron it ll be cheaper too in the long run especially if new large capacitors don t work as planned email please can t always read the net thanks in advance chris name mr chris smith twang on that ole guitar addrs scst uk ac liv csc uni liverpool university quest to build more and more hardware dgree computer science what ever the sun may be it is certainly not a ball of flaming gas d h lawrence all views expressed are my own and reflect that of private thought

re help with ultra long timing in article apr kuhub cc ukans edu wellison kuhub cc ukans e du writes i have a project that was drooped in my lap that is somewhat a pain to design what i am looking for is a stable ultra long solid state timer what they want to do is to place this thing on the antartic ice shelf and measure the amount of snow fall over a period of six weeks every two weeks they want to trip a selonoid to discharge different colored pellets by gas pressure out across the snow then by digging down into the snow the snow fall amount can be measured as they come to the different color pellets the problem is trying to build a timer that would stand the cold degrees and a power source that wouldn t drain i have looked at the xr timers and the standard ne dual timers but thier temp specs won t go that low also two weeks equates to seconds per firing which means one big timing cap i have found farad yes farad caps that have a working voltage of volts and are small in size but again the time of discharge at or lower degrees isn t linear i was thinking of using several timers chained together to fire the selonid at the end of the timing period but that blasted cold and the drain on a battery over six weeks is the pain one possibility would be to use solar panels but this is during the six month twilight anyone have any good ideas thanks in advance wes just a suggestion take a motorola mc b set it up to give you a pulse once every sec or ten secs with either a rc or xtal clock input then feed to a mc b as clock input and decode output for sec output might have to add a few and gates or decoder chips to get output and reset pulse back to the to restart cycle trigger a oneshot from the decoded riseing edge the one shot then goes to a mosfet to drive the mechanism to fire the pellet launcher these ckts require uamps of current between volts so a volt gel cell of a few amphours would last the six weeks then take the ckt board battery wrap in or of foam or build a box of out of the stuff with plywood or metal exterior build a small heater out of watt resistors in series to keep the battery and ckts warm nd thought use batteries one for heater one for timer and pellet trigger insolate insolate even though the chips state that the al rated devices are good to c the batteries have a considerable reduction in capacity oh make sure the area inside has minium air leakage hope this helps rw is this to long winded for the net be gentle

re dumb question function generator in article c j b murdoch acc virginia edu dgj y kelvin seas virginia edu david glen jacobowitz writes i have a new scope and i thought i d save a few bucks by buying one with a function generator built in hmm now where was that ad for the combination radio hand cranked generator flashlight siren i saw function generator has a mv offset and the amplitude s too high is there any way i could make myself a little box that could solve this little problem the box would tkae the function generator input lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some low unchanging number i would want to lower the voltage by a factor of one hundred or so i could just build a little buffer amp but i d like to have this box not be active sure you ve already got the right idea ignoring the ohm internal resistance of the generator for a second just run it into say a voltage divider made of ohms in series with ohms this new circuit is the thevenin equivalent of one that puts out of the original voltage and has an output impedence of negligibly less than ohms you may want to monkey with the values a little depending on whether you care more about the exact dividing ratio or the availability of parts hows that sound joel kolstad p s this is why those high voltage probes for multimeters can be accurate but still cheap they have something like megs in series with k which doesn t load the often high impedence source much as well as keeping the probably meg impedance multimeter happy

re uninterruptible power supply in article qk inn hp col col hp com cab col hp com chris best writes i m no expert at ups s but you said something that made it sound like you didn t realize something on a typical ups well on ours anyway there is no switchover from ac to dc all the protected equipment is always running from the batteries via an inverter with the usual condition of also having them on charge if the power fails big deal the computers never see it until the batteries start to droop but there s something like car sized batteries in that cabinet so it takes a while if you were gonna run the guts on straight dc instead of an inverter why not do it all the time then there d be no switchover to screw things up and no having to sense the failure fast just keep the dc on charge when the power is on and it ll be there in zero time when you need it actually it s a bit more complicated than that i sounds to me your ups takes in ac rectifies it to dc to charge the batteries and then takes the battery dc and chops it to ac again feeding your equipment this approach is the easiest and cleanest way to switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since as you mentioned nothing will know about what happened down the line another way to do the ups scheme is to use the mains until you lose power and then kick in the battery backup with it s inverter to replace the lost power the problem here is the switchover time and you ve got to resync the ac in no time flat unfortunately most everything is built around the assumption that ac is available so the ups guys have to provide and ac output to be usable ya sorta have to make it work with what there already similar story with our telephone system it was first invented back in the s we re still using the same damn system media as they did back then if i have a phone from back then i can assure you it ll work on today s phone system it costs too much to overhaul everyone to a new system so they make it work with what is out there

wiring where do i buy stuff subject introduction disclaimers although we ve done a fair bit of wiring we are not electricians and we cannot be responsible for what you do if you re at all uncertain about what is correct or safe don t do it contact someone qualified a licensed electrician or your local electrical inspector electricity is no joke mistakes can result in shocks fires or electrocution furthermore our discussion is based on the u s national electrical code nec and the canadian electrical code cec to the best of our abilities we have confirmed every detail with the electrical code but we don t quote sections simply to keep this thing readable if you think we re wrong we invite you to correct us but please quote references the nec and the cec do not in and of themselves have the force of law many municipalities adopt it en toto others however do not check your with your local building department and provincial hydro inspection offices in canada to find out what applies in your area also your local electrical utility may also have special requirements for electrical service installation bear in mind too that we say here applies primarily to ordinary single family residences multi family dwellings mobile homes commercial establishments etc are sometimes governed by different rules also note that contrary to popular belief in the u s and in some parts of canada canada is not a wholly owned subsidiary of the u s consequently the nec does not apply in canada lots of things are the same including voltages line frequencies and the laws of physics but there are a number of crucial differences in the regulations where we can we ve noted them flagging the relevant passages with nec or cec remember that the cec and nec are minimal standards it is often smart to go beyond their minimal requirements subject what is the nec where can i get a copy the nec is a model electrical code devised and published by the national fire protection association an insurance industry group it s revised every three years the version has been released you can buy a copy at a decent bookstore or by calling them directly at the code exists in several versions there s the full text which is fairly incomprehensible there s an abridged edition which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses and there s the nec handbook which contains the authorized commentary on the code as well as the full text that s the recommended version unfortunately there s no handbook for the abridged edition and the full handbook is expensive us plus shipping and handling subject what is the cec where can i get a copy the canadian standards association is an organization made up of various government agencies power utilities insurance companies electrical manufacturers and other organizations the csa publishes csa standard c which is updated every two or three years each province adopts with some amendments this standard and publishes a province specific code book since each province publishes its own slightly modified standard it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the csa standard itself in this faq cec really means the appropriate provincial standard in particular this faq is derived from the ontario hydro electrical safety code th edition which is in turn based on csa c th edition while differences exist between the provinces an attempt has been made to avoid specific to ontario detail the appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical inspection offices of your provincial power authority in ontario it s ontario hydro the ontario hydro book isn t overly fat it s about c and includes mailed updates i hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the equivalent nec publications don t bother asking in quebec diy wiring is banned throughout the province subject can i do my own wiring extra pointers in most places homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring in some they re not check with your local electrical inspector most places won t permit you to do wiring on other s homes for money without a license nor are you permitted to do wiring in commercial buildings multiple dwellings eg duplexes are usually considered semi commercial or commercial however many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi commercial wiring if you re supervised by a licensed electrician if you can find one willing to supervise if you do your own wiring an important point do it neat and well what you really want to aim for is a better job than an electrician will do after all it s your own home and it s you or your family that might get killed if you make a mistake an electrician has time pressures has the skills and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast safe job in this faq we ve consciously given a few recommendations that are in excess of code because we feel that it s reasonable and will impress the inspector the inspector will know that you re an amateur you have to earn his trust the best way of doing this is to spend your time doing as neat a job as possible don t cut corners exceed specifications otherwise the inspector may get extremely picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions don t try to hide anything from the inspector use the proper tools ie don t use a bread knife to strip wires or twist wires with your fingers the inspector won t like it and the results won t be that safe and it takes longer and you re more likely to stick a hunk of ga wire through your hand that way don t handle house wire when it s very cold eg below c or f thermoplastic house wire particularly older types become very brittle subject what do i need in the way of tools first there s the obvious a hammer a drill a few screwdrivers both straight and phillips head if you re lucky enough to live in canada or find a source of csa approved devices you need robertson square recess screwdrivers and instead of phillips for drilling a few holes a or spade bit and or electric drill will do if you re doing a lot or are working with elderly lumber we recommend a drill right angle drills are wonderful can be rented and or screw point auger drill bits these bits pull you through so they re much faster and less fatiguing even in year old hardwood timbers screw driver bits are useful for drills expecially if you install your electrical boxes using screws drywall screws work well for stripping wire use a real wire stripper not a knife or ordinary wire cutters don t buy the k mart combo stripper crimper and bottle opener types you should expect to pay to for a good plier type pair it will have sized stripping holes and won t nick or grab the wire it should be easy to strip wire with it one model has a small hole in the blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals there are fancier types autostrip cut but they generally aren t necessary and pros usually don t use them a pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends in constricted places don t use these for stripping wire you will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts you should have a pair of needle nose pliers for fiddling inside boxes and closing loops but it s better to form wire loops with a loop former hole on your wire stripper more accurate if you re using non metallic cable get a cable stripper for removing the sheath or do what some pros do they nick the end of the sheath grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a zipper and cut the sheath off you shouldn t try to strip the sheath with a knife point because it s too easy to slash the insulation on the conductors apparently stanley utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters hooked blades can be used to strip sheath but there is still the possibility that you ll gouge the conductors for any substantial amount of work with armored cable it s well worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter us hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire or the insulation three prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly wired outlets about multimeters tell you more but are a lot more expensive and probably not worth it for most people a simple voltage sensor which can detect potential through an insulated wire not supplying any devices is extremely helpful they cost about us at radio shack you should have a voltage detector to check that the wires are dead before doing work on them neon bulb version are cheap and work well if you get more serious a audible alarm type is good for tracing circuits without a helper though i ve been known to lock the drill on and hit breakers until the scream stops for running wires through existing walls you need fish tape often two tapes are needed though sometimes a bent hanger or a length of thin chain will suffice fish tapes can be rented electrical tape lots of it seriously a good and competent wiring job will need very little tape the tape is useful for wrapping dicy insulation in repair work another use is to wrap around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination screws i don t do this but drywall contractors prefer it to prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet that has no cover plate subject what is ul listing the ul stands for underwriters laboratory it used to be an insurance industry organization but now it is independent and non profit it tests electrical components and equipment for potential hazards when something is ul listed that means that the ul has tested the device and it meets their requirements for safety ie fire or shock hazard it doesn t necessarily mean that the device actually does what it s supposed to just that it probably won t kill you the ul does not have power of law in the u s you are permitted to buy and install non ul listed devices however insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to the failure of a non ul listed device furthermore in many situations the nec will require that a wiring component used for a specific purpose is ul listed for that purpose indirectly this means that certain parts of your wiring must be ul listed before an inspector will approve it and or occupancy permits issued subject what is csa approval every electrical device or component must be certified by the canadian standards association before it can be sold in canada implicit in this is that all wiring must be done with csa approved materials they perform testing similar to the ul a bit more stringent except that csa approval is required by law again like the ul if a fire was caused by non csa approved equipment your insurance company may not have to pay the claim in canada there is a branch organization of the ul called ulc ul of canada ulc does not have power of law and seems to be more a liason group between the csa and insurance companies subject are there any cheaper easier to read books on wiring usa the following three books were suggested by our readers residential wiring by jeff markell craftsman books carlsbad ca for isbn practical electrical wiring residential farm and industrial based on the national electrical code ansi nfpa herbert p richter and w creighton schwan mcgraw hill book co wiring simplified h p richter and w c schwan park publishing co try to make sure that the book is based on the latest nec revision which is currently canada p s knight authors and publishes a book called electrical code simplified there appears to be a version published specific to each province and is very tied into the appropriate provincial code it focuses on residential wiring and is indispensible for canadian diy ers it is better to get this book than the cec unless you do a lot of wiring or answer questions on the net it is updated each time the provincial codes are this book is available at all diy and hardware stores for less than c subject inspections how and what why should i get my wiring inspected most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and inspections of any wiring that is done amongst other more mundane bureaucratic reasons like insurance companies not liking to have to pay claims a permit and inspections provides some assurance that you your family your neighbors or subsequent owners of your home don t get killed or lose their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your home or order you to tear out any wiring done without a permit california for instance is particularly nasty about this if fire starts in your home and un inspected wiring is at fault insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage claims in general the process goes like this you apply to your local inspections office or building department for a permit you should have a sketch or detailed drawing of what you plan on doing this is a good time to ask questions on any things you re not sure of if you re doing major work they may impose special conditions on you require loading calculations and ask other questions at this point they will tell you which inspections you will need if you re installing a main panel you will need to have the panel and service connections inspected before your power utility will provide a connection this is sometimes done by the local power authority rather than the usual inspectors after installing the boxes and wiring but before the insulation walls go up you will need a rough in inspection after the walls are up and the wiring is complete you will need a final inspection subject my house doesn t meet some of these rules and regulations do i have to upgrade in general there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings though there are some exceptions ie smoke detectors in some cases however any new work must be done according to the latest electrical code also if you do major work you may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all of your system check with your local electrical inspector subject a word on voltages one thing where things might get a bit confusing is the different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of a circuit one person might talk about v another v or another v these are all in fact exactly the same thing in north america the utility companies are required to supply a split phase volt feed to your house this works out as two v legs additionally since there are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring it s not unreasonable to find v has dropped to v or v has dropped to v by the time the power reaches a wall outlet especially at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run for a number of reasons some historical some simple personal orneryness different people choose call them by slightly different numbers this faq has chosen to be consistent with calling them v and v except when actually saying what the measured voltage will be confusing a bit just ignore it one thing that might make this a little more understandable is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower ie v instead of v value what this implies is that the device is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that low v is not the same as v v is the voltage between phases of a phase y circuit that is v from neutral to any hot v is the voltage between phases of a phase y circuit that s v from hot to neutral in keeping with v versus v strangeness motors intended to run on v three phase are often labelled as v subject what does an electrical service look like there are logically four wires involved with supplying the main panel with power three of them will come from the utility pole and a fourth bare wire comes from elsewhere the bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded into the ground or to a wire buried in the foundation or sometimes to the water supply pipe has to be metal continuous to where the main water pipe entering the house watch out for galvanic action conductivity breaks often between copper and iron pipe this is the grounding conductor it is there to make sure that the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground this wire normally carries no current one of the other wires will be white or black with white or yellow stripes or sometimes simply black it is the neutral wire it is connected to the centre tap cec center tap in the nec of the distribution transformer supplying the power it is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place often inside the panel the neutral and ground should not be connected anywhere else otherwise weird and or dangerous things may happen furthermore there should only be one grounding system in a home some codes require more than one grounding electrode these will be connected together or connected to the neutral at a common point still one grounding system adding additional grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house wiring is unsafe and contrary to code if you add a subpanel the ground and neutral are usually brought as separate conductors from the main panel and are not connected together in the subpanel ie still only one neutral ground connection however in some situations certain categories of separate buildings you actually do have to provide a second grounding electrode consult your inspector the other two wires will usually be black and are the hot wires they are attached to the distribution transformer as well the two black wires are degrees out of phase with each other this means if you connect something to both hot wires the voltage will be volts if you connect something to the white and either of the two blacks you will get v some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them this is either because the neutral and ground are connected together at a different point eg the meter or pole and one wire is doing dual duty as both neutral and ground or in some rare occasions the service has only one hot wire v only service subject what is a circuit inside the panel connections are made to the incoming wires these connections are then used to supply power to selected portions of the home there are three different combinations one hot one neutral and ground v circuit two hots no neutral and ground v circuit two hots neutral and ground v circuit neutral and or two v circuits with a common neutral is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and lighting within your house is usually used for supplying power to major appliances such as stoves and dryers they often have need for both v and v or for bringing several circuits from the panel box to a distribution point is usually for special v motor circuits electric heaters or air conditioners note in the us the nec frequently permits a circuit similar to be used for stoves and dryers namely that there are two hot wires and a wire that does dual duty as neutral and ground and is connected to the frame as well as providing the neutral for v purposes three prong plugs instead of four only for stoves dryers connected to the main panel when connected to most sub panels prong plugs and receptacles are required in our not so humble opinion this is crazy but the nfpa claims that this practice was re evaluated for the nec and found to be safe check your local codes or inquire as to local practice there are restrictions on when this is permissible is usually wired with three conductor wire black for hot white for neutral and bare for grounding and have one hot wire coloured red the other black a bare wire for grounding and in a white wire for neutral you will sometimes see wired with just a black white and ground wire since the white is hot in this case both the nec and cec requires that the white wire be permanently marked at the ends to indicate that it is a live wire usually done with paint nail polish or sometimes electrical tape each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the panel through a circuit breaker or fuse there are in a few locales circuits that look like or except that they have two bare ground wires some places require this for hot tubs and the like one ground is frame ground the other attaches to the motor this may or may not be an alternative to gfci protection subject grounding versus grounded versus neutral according to the terminology in the cec and nec the grounding conductor is for the safety ground i e the green or bare wire the word neutral is reserved for the white when you have a circuit with more than one hot wire since the white wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the panel the proper term is grounded conductor however the potential confusion between grounded conductor and grounding conductor can lead to potentially lethal mistakes you should never use the bare wire as a grounded conductor or white wire as the grounding conductor even though they are connected together in the panel but not in subpanels subpanels are fed neutral and ground separately from the main panel usually in the trade and in common usage the word neutral is used for grounded conductor this faq uses neutral simply to avoid potential confusion we recommend that you use neutral too thus the white wire is always except in some light switch applications neutral not ground subject what does a fuse or breaker do what are the differences fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels for example if your toaster shorts out a fuse or breaker should trip protecting the wiring in the walls from melting as such fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the wiring ul or csa approval supposedly indicates that the equipment itself won t cause a fire fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt safely when the current exceeds the rated value thereby interrupting the power to the circuit fuses trip relatively fast which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have large startup current surges for motor circuits you can use a time delay fuse one brand is fusetron which will avoid tripping on momentary overloads a fusetron looks like a spring loaded fuse a fuse can only trip once then it must be replaced breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices they usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched into position against another contact when the current flow through the device exceeds the rated value a bimetallic strip heats up and bends by bending it trips the latch and the spring pulls the contacts apart circuit breakers behave similarly to fusetrons that is they tend to take longer to trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses with high overloads they trip quickly breakers can be reset a finite number of times each time they trip or are thrown when the circuit is in use some arcing takes place which damages the contacts thus breakers should not be used in place of switches unless they are specially listed for the purpose neither fuses nor breakers limit the current per se a dead short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time which can often cause severe damage subject breakers can t i use fuses statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher risk of causing a fire than breaker panels this is usually due to the fuse being loosely screwed in or the contacts corroding and heating up over time or the wrong size fuse being installed or the proverbial replace the fuse with a penny trick since breakers are more permanently installed and have better connection mechanisms the risk of fire is considerably less fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload when a fuse explodes the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting path result from complete meltdown of the electrical panel melted service wiring through fires in the electrical distribution transformer and having your house burn down breakers don t do this many jurisdictions particularly in canada no longer permit fuse panels in new installations the nec does permit new fuse panels in some rare circumstances requiring the special inserts to key the fuseholder to specific size fuses some devices notably certain large air conditioners require fuse protection in addition to the breaker at the panel the fuse is there to protect the motor windings from overload check the labeling on the unit this is usually only on large permanently installed motors the installation instructions will tell you if you need one subject what size wire should i use for a amp circuit use gauge wire for a amp circuit you can use gauge wire in most locales for a long run though you should use the next larger size wire to avoid voltage drops gauge is only slightly more expensive than gauge though it s stiffer and harder to work with here s a quick table for normal situations go up a size for more than foot runs when the cable is in conduit or ganged with other wires in a place where they can t dissipate heat easily gauge amps we don t list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent on the application and precise wire type subject where do these numbers come from there are two considerations voltage drop and heat buildup the smaller the wire is the higher the resistance is when the resistance is higher the wire heats up more and there is more voltage drop in the wiring the former is why you need higher temperature insulation and or bigger wires for use in conduit the latter is why you should use larger wire for long runs neither effect is very significant over very short distances there are some very specific exceptions where use of smaller wire is allowed the obvious one is the line cord on most lamps don t try this unless you re certain that your use fits one of those exceptions you can never go wrong by using larger wire subject what does mean this is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors in a cable the first number specifies the gauge the second the number of current carrying conductors in the wire but remember there s usually an extra ground wire means gauge two insulated current carrying wires plus bare ground wire usually has a black white and bare ground wire sometimes the white is red instead for v circuits without neutral in the latter case the sheath is usually red too wire usually has a black red white and bare ground wire usually carrying v with neutral subject what is a wirenut marrette marr connector how are they used a wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that s used to connect wires together marrette or marr connector are trade names you ll usually use a lot of them in diy wiring in essence you strip the end of the wires about an inch twist them together then twist the wirenut on though some wirenuts advertise that you don t need to twist the wire do it anyways it s more mechanically and electrically secure there are many different sizes of wire nut you should check that the wire nut you re using is the correct size for the quantity and sizes of wire you re connecting together don t just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or your fingers use a pair of blunt nose linesman pliers and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly sometimes it s a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it goes in the wirenut properly some people wrap the open end of the wirenut with electrical tape this is probably not a good idea the inspector may tear it off during an inspection it s usually done because a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut instead of taping it the connection should be redone subject what is a gfi gfci a gfci is a ground fault circuit interrupter it measures the current current flowing through the hot wire and the neutral wire if they differ by more than a few milliamps the presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other path this may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of an appliance or to the ground lead or through a person any of these situations is hazardous so the gfci trips breaking the circuit gfcis do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks if for example you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral leads of a circuit and no part of you was grounded a gfci wouldn t help all of the current that passed from the hot lead into you would return via the neutral lead keeping the gfci happy the two pairs of connections on a gfci outlet are not symmetric one is labeled load the other line the incoming power feed must be connected to the line side or the outlet will not be protected the load side can be used to protect all devices downstream from it thus a whole string of outlets can be covered by a single gfci outlet subject where should gfcis be used the nec mandates gfcis for v a or a single phase outlets in bathrooms kitchens within of the sink garages unfinished basements or crawl spaces outdoors near a pool or just about anywhere else where you re likely to encounter water or dampness there are exceptions for inaccessible outlets those dedicated to appliances occupying fixed space typically refrigerators and freezers and for sump pumps and laundry appliances the cec does not mandate as many gfcis in particular there is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets or most garage or basement outlets basement outlets must be protected if you have a dirt floor garage outlets if they re near the door to outside bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have gfcis even if you are not required to have gfci protection you may want to consider installing it anyway unless you need a gfci breaker see below the cost is low in the u s gfci outlets can cost as little as us costs are a bit higher in canada c evaluate your own risk factors does your finished basement ever get wet do you have small children do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools does water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage subject where shouldn t i use a gfci gfcis are generally not used on circuits that a don t pose a safety risk and b are used to power equipment that must run unattended for long periods of time refrigerators freezers and sump pumps are good examples the rationale is that gfcis are sometimes prone to nuisance trips some people claim that the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary current imbalance tripping the gfci note though that most gfci trips are real if you re getting a lot of trips for no apparent reason you d be well advised to check your wiring before deciding that the gfci is broken or useless subject what is the difference between a gfci outlet and a gfci breaker for most situations you can use either a gfci outlet as the first device on the circuit or you can install a breaker with a built in gfci the former is generally preferred since gfci breakers are quite expensive for example an ordinary ge breaker costs us the gfci model costs us there is one major exception if you need to protect a multi wire branch circuit two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire such as a canadian style kitchen circuit you ll need a multi pole gfci breaker unfortunately these are expensive the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars depending on what brand of panel box you have but if you must protect such a circuit say for a pool heater you have no choice one more caveat gfci outlets are bulky you may want to use an oversize box when installing them on second thought use large actually deep boxes everywhere you ll thank yourself for it incidentally if you re installing a gfci to ensure that one specific outlet is protected such as a bathroom you don t really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first outlet in the circuit you could simply find the first outlet in the bathroom and not gfci anything upstream of it but protecting the whole circuit is preferred when you install a gfci it s a good idea to use the little ground fault protected stickers that come with it and mark the outlets downstream of the gfci you can figure out which outlets are downstream simply by tripping the gfci with the test button and see which outlets are dead subject what s the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet then apart from their use in electronics which we won t comment on and for certain fluorescent lights they won t turn on without a good ground connection they re intended to guard against insulation failures within the device generally the case of the appliance is connected to the ground lead if there s an insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case the ground lead conducts the electricity away safely and possibly trips the circuit breaker in the process if the case is not grounded and such a short occurs the case is live and if you touch it while you re grounded you ll get zapped of course if the circuit is gfci protected it will be a very tiny zap which is why you can use gfcis to replace ungrounded outlets both nec and cec there are some appliances that should never be grounded in particular that applies to toasters and anything else with exposed conductors consider if you touch the heating electrode in a toaster and you re not grounded nothing will happen if you re slightly grounded you ll get a small shock the resistance will be too high but if the case were grounded and you were holding it you d be the perfect path to ground subject why is one prong wider than the other polarization nowadays many two prong devices have one prong wider than the other this is so that the device could rely not guaranteed on one specific wire being neutral and the other hot this is particularly advantageous in light fixtures where the the shell should neutral safety or other devices which want to have an approximate ground reference ie some radios most prong extension cords have wide prongs too this requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right way around you want the wide prong to be neutral and the narrow one hot most outlets have a darker metal for the hot screw and lighter coloured screw for the neutral if not you can usually figure out which is which by which prong the terminating screw connects to subject what kind of outlets do i need in a kitchen the nec requires at least two amp small appliance circuits for kitchens the cec requires split duplex receptacles outlets must be installed such that no point is more than nec mm cec from an outlet every counter wider than nec or mm cec must have at least one outlet the circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except in the kitchen pantry or dining room furthermore these circuits are in addition to any required for refrigerators stoves microwaves lighting etc non dedicated outlets within of a sink must be protected by a gfci nec only split duplex receptacles are fed with a v circuit the tab is broken on the hot side of the outlet and one hot goes to the upper outlet and the other hot goes to the lower outlet the neutral connects to both outlets through one screw when carrying through to another outlet the neutral must be pigtailed such that removing the outlet or having the neutral connection fall off doesn t cause the neutral to disconnect from downstream outlets subject where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms there must be at least one outlet in each bathroom adjacent to the sink in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in the light fixture all such outlets must be gfci protected subject what is romex nm nmd what is bx when should i use each romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire sometimes called non metallic sheath the formal name is nm this is suitable for use in dry protected areas ie inside stud walls on the sides of joists etc that are not subject to mechanical damage or excessive heat most newer homes are wired almost exclusively with nm wire there are several different categories of nm cable bx cable technically known as armored cable or ac has a flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is fairly resistant to damage teck cable is ac with an additional external thermoplastic sheath protection for cable in concealed locations where nm or ac cable is run through studs joists or similar wooden members the outer surface of the cable must be kept at least mm cec nec from the edges of the wooden members or the cable should be protected from mechanical injury this latter protection can take the form of metal plates such as spare outlet box ends or conduit note inspector permitted practise in canada suggests that armored cable or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection but this is technically illegal additional protection recommendations these are rules in the canadian codes they are reasonable answers to the vague references to exposed to mechanical damage in both the nec and cec nm cable should be protected against mechanical damage where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls in exposed locations under feet from the floor ie use ac instead flexible conduit wooden guards etc where cable is suspended as in connections to furnaces or water heaters the wire should be protected canadian practise is usually to install a junction or outlet box on the wall and use a short length of ac cable or nm cable in flexible conduit to jump to the appliance stapling nm to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used where nm cable is run in close proximity to heating ducts or pipe heat transfer should be minimized by means of a mm air space or suitable insulation material a wad of fiberglass nm cable shall be supported within mm of every box or fitting and at intervals of no more than m holes in joists or studs are considered supports some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to each box while fishing cable is technically in violation it is permitted where proper support is impractical conductor nm cable should never be stapled on edge knight also insists on only one cable per staple referring to the workmanship clause but this seems more honoured in the breach cable should never be buried in plaster cement or similar finish cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more than m whenever bx cable is terminated at a box with a clamp small plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through the insulation bx is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by solid wall coverings in places where damage is more likely like on the back wall of a garage you may be required to use conduit a ul or csa approved metal pipe you use various types of fittings to join the pipe or provide entrance exit for the wire service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit in damp places eg buried wiring to outdoor lighting you will need special wire eg cec nmw nec uf nmw looks like very heavy duty nmd you will usually need short lengths of conduit where the wire enters exits the ground see underground wiring section thermoplastic sheath wire such as nm nmw etc should not be exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that purpose many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through furnace ducts including cold air return plenums constructed by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces the reason for this is that if there s a fire the ducting will spread toxic gasses from burning insulation very rapidly through the building teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas canada appears to use similar wire designations to the us except that canadian wire designations usually include the temperature rating in celsius eg ac versus ac in the us nm b is degrees celcius note local codes vary this is one of the items that changes most often eg chicago codes require conduit everywhere there are very different requirements for mobile homes check your local codes especially if you re doing anything that s the slightest out of the ordinary wire selection table incomplete the real tables are enormous uncommon wire types or applications omitted condition type cec nec exposed concealed dry plastic nmd nm armor ac ac teck exposed concealed damp plastic nmd nmc armor acwu teck exposed concealed wet plastic nmwu armor acwu teck exposed to weather plastic nmwu tw etc armor teck direct earth burial plastic nmwu uf service entrance rwu twu armor ra teck acwu nmwu not for service entrance subject should i use plastic or metal boxes the nec permits use of plastic boxes with non metallic cable only the reasoning is simple with armored cable the box itself provides ground conductor continuity u s plastic boxes don t use metal cable clamps the cec is slightly different the cec never permits cable armor as a grounding conductor however you must still provide ground continuity for metallic sheath the cec also requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes the advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for non metallic sheathed cable you can avoid making one ground connection and they sometimes cost a little less on the other hand plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts for exposed or shop wiring metal boxes are probably better subject junction box positioning a junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together junction boxes must be located in such a way that they re accessible later ie not buried under plaster excessive use of junction boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation and inspectors may get nasty subject can i install a replacement light fixture in general one can replace fixtures freely subject to a few caveats first of course one should check the amperage rating of the circuit if your heart is set on installing half a dozen watt floodlights you may need to run a new wire back to the panel box but there are some more subtle constraints as well for example older house wiring doesn t have high temperature insulation the excess heat generated by a ceiling mounted lamp can and will cause the insulation to deteriorate and crack with obvious bad results some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high temperature wire only you may find in fact that your ceiling wiring already has this problem in which case replacing any devices is a real adventure other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some fluorescent fixtures and making sure that the ceiling box and its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy chandelier or ceiling fan you may need to install a new box specifically listed for this purpose a x across the ceiling joists makes a good support metal brackets are also available that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and mounted between the joists there are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as pot lamps or heat lamps when these are installed in insulated ceilings they can present a very substantial fire hazard the cec provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated ceilings provided that the fixture is boxed in a coffin usually x x made by making a pair of joists high and covering with plywood that doesn t have any insulation yes that s feet long nec rules are somewhat less stringent they require at least clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation the rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement which means that a cec style coffin might be worthwhile presumably that s up to the local inspector the cec doesn t actually mandate the coffin per se this seems to be an inspector requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can t get accidentally buried in insulation ie if you have insulation blown in later there are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation they are usually limited to watt bulbs and are unfortunately somewhat more expensive than the older types before you use them you should ensure that they have explicit ul or csa approval for such uses follow the installation instructions carefully the prescribed location for the sensor can vary there does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved for use in insulation the coffin appears the only legal approach subject what does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts this usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is loose depending on the load balance one hot wire may end up being more than v and the other less than v with respect to ground this is a very hazardous situation it can destroy your electronic equipment possibly start fires and in some situations electrocute you ie some us jurisdictions require the stove frame connected to neutral if this happens contact your electrical authority immediately and have them come and check out the problem note a brief second brightening is sometimes normal with lighting and motors on the same v with neutral circuit a loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness far longer than one second in case of doubt get help subject what is phase power should i use it can i get it in my house three phase power has three hot wires degrees out of phase with each other these are usually used for large motors because it is more efficient provides a bit more starting torque and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper you re most likely to encounter a phase circuit that shows volts between any hot and ground and volts between any two hots the latter shows the difference between a normal v v common neutral circuit which is volts between the two hots there are phase circuits with different voltages bringing in a phase feed to your house is usually ridiculously expensive or impossible if the equipment you want to run has a standard motor mount it is much cheaper to buy a new v or v motor for it in some cases it is possible to run phase equipment on ordinary power if you have a capacitor start unit or use a larger motor as a auto generator these are tricky but are a good solution if the motor is non standard size or too expensive or too big to replace the taunton press book the small shop has an article on how to do this if you must note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using such a converter the laws of thermodynamics guarantee that subject is it better to run motors at or theoretically it doesn t make any difference however there is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply wiring all things being equal a v motor will lose times less power in the house wiring than a v motor this also means that the startup surge loss will be less and the motor will get to speed quicker and in some circumstances the smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life this is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more than feet long subject what is this nonsense about hp on v a circuits it is a universal physical law that hp is equal to watts given heating loss power factor and other inefficiencies it is usually best to consider hp is going to need watts a v a circuit can only deliver watts to a motor so it cannot possibly be more than approximately hp given rational efficiency factors hp is more like it some equipment manufacturers sears in particular most router manufacturers in general advertise a hp rating that is far in excess of what is possible they are giving you a stall horsepower or similar that means the power is measured when the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load what they don t mention is that if you kept it in that condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker will trip otherwise the motor will melt it s drawing far more current than it can continuously when comparing motors compare the continuous horsepower this should be on the motor nameplate if you can t find that figure check the amperage rating which is always present subject how do i convert two prong receptacles to three prong older homes frequently have two prong receptacles instead of the more modern three these receptacles have no safety ground and the cabling usually has no ground wire neither the nec or cec permits installing new prong receptacles anymore there are several different approaches to solving this if the wiring is done through conduit or bx and the conduit is continuous back to the panel you can connect the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle box nec mainly cec frowns on this practise if there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby and it s continuous to the main house ground point you can run a conductor to it from the third prong run a ground conductor back to the main panel easiest install a gfci receptacle the ground lug should not be connected to anything but the gfci protection itself will serve instead the gfci will also protect downstream possibly also two prong outlets if you do this to protect downstream outlets the grounds must not be connected together since it wouldn t be connected to a real ground a wiring fault could energize the cases of prong devices connected to other outlets be sure though that there aren t indirect ground plug connections such as via the sheath on bx cable the cec permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three prong if you fill the u ground with a non conducting goop like caulking compound this is not permitted in the nec subject are you sure about gfcis and ungrounded outlets should the test button work we re sure about what the nec and cec say remember though that your local codes may vary as for the test button there s a resistor connecting the load side of the hot wire to the line side of the neutral wire when you press the test button current through this resistor shows up as an imbalance and trips the gfci this is a simple passive and reliable test and doesn t require a real ground to work if your gfci does not trip when you press the test button it is very probably defective or miswired again if the test button doesn t work something s broken and potentially dangerous the problem should be corrected immediately the instructions that come with some gfcis specify that the ground wire must be connected we do not know why they say this the causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet or with the formalities of ul or csa listing perhaps the device was never tested without the ground wire being connected on the other hand ul or csa approval should only have been granted if the device behaves properly in all listed applications including ungrounded outlet replacement one of us called leviton their gfcis are labeled for installation on grounded circuits only the technician was surprised to see that he agreed that the nec does not require it and promised to investigate subject how should i wire my shop as with any other kind of wiring you need enough power for all devices that will be on simultaneously the code specifies that you should stay under of the nominal capacity of the circuit for typical home shop use this means one circuit for the major power tools and possibly one for a dust collector or shop vac use at least gauge wire many power tools have big motors with a big start up surge if you can use amp breakers nec though cec requires standard a receptacles which means you d have to replug all your equipment lights should either be on a circuit of their own and not shared with circuits in the rest of the house or be on at least two separate circuits the idea is that you want to avoid a situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand rpm while you re groping in the dark for the off switch do install lots of outlets it s easier to install them in the beginning when you don t have to cut into an existing cable it s useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each point so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same time as the tool you really want but use metal boxes and plates and maybe even metal sheathed cable you may have objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit wrong note that some jurisdictions have a no horizontal wiring rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used for working what this means is that all wiring must be run along structural members ie stapled to studs other possible shop circuits include heater circuits v circuits for some large tools and air compressor circuits don t overload circuits and don t use extension cords if you can help it unless they re rated for high currents a coiled extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of the same gauge also the insulation won t withstand as much heat and heat dissipation is the critical issue if your shop is located at some remove from your main panel you should probably install a subpanel and derive your shop wiring from it if you have young children you may want to equip this panel with a cut off switch and possibly a lock if you want to install individual switches to safe particular circuits make sure you get ones rated high enough for example ordinary light switches are not safely able to handle the start up surge generated by a table saw buy horsepower rated switches instead finally note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished basements hence the nec requirements for gfcis apply and even if you know that you d never use one of your shop outlets to run a lawn mower the next owner of your house might have a different idea note fine woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop wiring april is one place to start subject underground wiring you will need to prepare a trench to specifications use special wire protect the wire with conduit or special plastic tubing and possibly lumber don t use creosoted lumber it rots thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion of lead the transition from in house to underground wire is generally via conduit all outdoor boxes must be specifically listed for the purpose and contain the appropriate gaskets fittings etc if the location of the box is subject to immersion in water a more serious style of water proof box is needed and of course don t forget the gfcis the required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction so we suggest you consult your inspector about your specific situation a hint buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says buried power line and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed subject aluminum wiring during the s aluminum instead of copper wiring became quite popular and was extensively used since that time aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations we recommend even if you re allowed to that do not use it for new wiring but don t panic if your house has aluminum wiring aluminum wiring when properly installed can be just as safe as copper aluminum wiring is however very unforgiving of improper installation we will cover a bit of the theory behind potential problems and what you can do to make your wiring safe the main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as cold creep when aluminum wiring warms up it expands when it cools down it contracts unlike copper when aluminum goes through a number of warm cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each time to make the problem worse aluminum oxidises or corrodes when in contact with certain types of metal so the resistance of the connection goes up which causes it to heat up and corrode oxidize still more eventually the wire may start getting very hot melt the insulation or fixture it s attached to and possibly even cause a fire since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move into a house built during the s we will cover basic points of safe aluminum wiring we suggest that if you re considering purchasing a home with aluminum wiring or have discovered it later that you hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring for the following things fixtures eg outlets and switches directly attached to aluminum wiring should be rated for it the device will be stamped with al cu or co alr the latter supersedes the former but both are safe these fixtures are somewhat more expensive than the ordinary ones wires should be properly connected at least way around the screw in a clockwise direction connections should be tight while repeated tightening of the screws can make the problem worse during the inspection it would pay off to snug up each connection note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the main service entrance cable it should be inspected push in terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire any connections using push in terminals should be redone with the proper screw connections immediately there should be no signs of overheating darkened connections melted insulation or baked fixtures any such damage should be repaired connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be handled specially current canadian codes require that the wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting aluminum to copper the nec requires that the wire be connected together using special crimp devices with an anti oxidant grease the tools and materials for the latter are quite expensive not practical to do it yourself unless you can rent the tool any non rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring by means of a short copper pigtail see above shows reasonable workmanship neat wiring properly stripped not nicked wire etc if when considering purchasing a home an inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two we believe that you can consider the wiring safe if there are signs of problems in many places we suggest you look elsewhere if the wrong receptacles are used you can replace them with the proper type or use pigtails having this professionally done can range from to per receptacle switch you can do this yourself too subject i m buying a house what should i do congratulations but it s generally a good idea to hire an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas not just for wiring but plumbing and structural as well if an inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor ones we believe that you can consider the wiring safe after any minor problems are fixed if there are signs of problems in many places we suggest you look elsewhere here s some hints on what to look for obvious non code wiring can include zip cord wiring either concealed or nailed to walls hot wiring on the identified neutral conductor without proper marking ungrounded grounding outlets except when downstream of a gfci splices hanging in mid air other than proper knob and tube switched neutrals unsecured romex swinging about like grapevines certain wiring practises that are actually to code or were at one time sometimes reveal diy wiring that may have hidden violations switches that seem to control nothing abandoned perhaps not properly terminated wiring a wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are separately controlled by other wall switches except when it s really convenient switches and outlets in bizarre locations great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or ceiling backwrapped grounding wires subject what is this weird stuff old style wiring in the years since edison invented electricity several different wiring styles have come and gone when you buy an older home you may encounter some of this stuff this section describes the old methods and some of their idiosyncrasies the oldest wiring system you re likely to encounter is called knob and tube k t it is made up of individual conductors with a cloth insulation the wires are run along side structural members eg joists or studs using ceramic stand offs knobs wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes connections were made by twisting the wire together soldering and wrapping with tape since the hot and neutral were run separately the wiring tends to be rather confusing a neutral often runs down the centre of each room with taps off to each fixture the hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next in some cases k t isn t colour coded so the neutral is often the same colour as the hot wires you ll see k t in homes built as late as the s comments on k t the people installing k t were pretty paranoid about electricity so the workmanship tends to be pretty good the wire insulation and insulators tend to stand up very well most k t i ve seen for example is in quite good condition no grounding grounding is usually difficult to install boxes are small receptacle replacement particularly with gfci can be difficult no bushing on boxes either so wiring changes need special attention to box entry sometimes the neutral isn t balanced very well between separately hot circuits so it is sometimes possible to overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on any circuit building code does not permit insulation in walls that contain k t connection to existing k t from new circuits can be tricky consult your inspector modern wiring practise requires considerably more outlets to be installed than k t systems did since k t tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn t necessary to replace it simply because it s k t what you should watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and be cautious about circuit loading in many cases it s perfectly reasonable to leave existing k t alone and add new fixtures on new circuits using modern techniques after k t they invented multi conductor cable the first type you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation it looks much like the romex cable of the last decade or two this stuff was used in the s and s again no grounding conductor it was installed much like modern wiring its major drawback is that this type of insulation embrittles we ve seen whole systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at a touch bx cable of the same vintage has similar problems this stuff is very fragile and becomes rather hazardous if the wires become bare this wiring should be left untouched as much as possible whenever an opportunity arises replace it a simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat shrink tubing after this wiring technique the more modern romex was invented it s almost a asphalt impregnated cloth often a bit sticky this stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn t present a hazard and is reasonably easy to work with it does not need to be replaced it should be considered as safe as the modern stuff thermoplastic insulation wire just don t abuse it too much subject where

grounding power wiring was re a question about vac outlet wiring there has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding practices here a few points need to be clarified the equipment grounding conductor green green with a yellow stripe bare or the metal sheath or pipe of some wiring methods is used as a safety ground to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects it should never except for a few exceptions to be discussed later carry the normal operating current of a connected load some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation orange outlets are often used for this with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box and in many cases back to the service anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the national electric code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems the code requires the insulated grounding conductors green wires to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box and if required back all the way to the service entrance where it is bonded to the service ground water pipe or rod many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either the grounded conductor of a circuit often called the neutral which is referred to in the code as the identified conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey this conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point generally at the service entrance panel this connection is through the main bonding jumper in many household service panels the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel the grounded conductor neutral is generally a current carrying conductor in the case of a volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device since the grounded conductor neutral is only connected to the grounding conductor bare or green at the service entrance if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load under normal operating conditions if you should incorrectly connect the grounded neutral conductor to the grounding conductor at the load some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end if the load equipment has a metal case which is connected to the grounding conductor through the u ground plug the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential the difference under normal non short circuit conditions may be only a few tenths of a volt but it could also be a volt or two this normally does not present a shock hazard however if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe a radiator a metal air conditioning duct or such part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path if the contact is not solid you will get a significant arc a low voltage but possibly moderate current arc under the wrong conditions this arcing could start a fire it is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current could also flow through a wire of inadequate size causing it to overheat with the incorrect non single point grounding of the neutral if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor which increases the possibility for shock or fire also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment often causing malfunction i have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment the neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling this is done primarily for lightning protection so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly the bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer some of it flows through the grounding electrode water pipe etc this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks and it may also cause measurable ac magnetic fields due to the large loop between the hot conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground there are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy don t flame me on this i m just telling you where the field comes from not it s health effect as far as i m concerned the jury is still out on this note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel not at any sub distribution panels this is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral the sheath can be used in this application only as the grounding conductor if the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground with the possible problems listed above the code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers as well as feeds from one building to another in the cases of the range and dryer the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions instead of a seperate wire every time the code is revised these exceptions come up for review these exceptions were in fact the first required safety grounds in the days before u ground outlets and such the appliance manufacturers don t want to have to redesign their ranges and driers and the contractors don t want to have to run four wire cable with four fairly heavy expensive wires in place of three wire to the appliances no question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove but the neutral current is low for most burner settings since most current is in the volt hots except at some low settings the wires are large gauge and there are few reported cases of injury or damage so far the exceptions have survived in the case of feeds between buildings it s primarily for lightning protection people doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn t a legal grounding conductor obviously the bare wire in romex with ground is anywhere there is a green wire installed such as in a portable cord that is a good grounding conductor the sheath of bx clamped in bx connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor in the us bx has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath you can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends you don t have to bond it to anything it does its job by touching every turn of the bx sheath conduit or emt thinwall tubing is generally a legal grounding conductor but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel particularly for larger pipes greenfield looks like big bx but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it is not a legal grounding conductor as it doesn t have the aluminum band to bond it and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance you have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield wiremold is also not a legal grounding conductor as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact and the feed to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box i have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were hot with volts why do i get a shock every time i touch my computer and the radiator here in the office because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box you must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring conduit bx etc where you can bond the wire to the box with a screw bnding clip or whatever on another issue while you should ground the green wire lug on gcfi outlets when ever there is a place to ground them it is legal in the nec to use them without a ground if no ground is available it is better to have the protection of the ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don t install it the interrupter doesn t depend on the ground to trip it is desirable to connect the ground if available because if the ground is connected the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in whereas without the ground it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path for those questioning the legal use of ungrounded gcfi s read in the nec d exception this is the code my code is in the city but i know the rule hasn t changed it might be

how starters work really in article aa insane apana org au peter m insane apana org au peter tryndoch writes so when you turn on the power this causes the bulb to work like a neon heating up and shorting out thus providing a loop to power the heaters in the main tube when the tube fires insufficient current runs through the starter to keep the heat up and the bi metalic strip straightens out o c imprecise this description ignores the role of the ballast misrepresents the heating effects in the starter the bimetalic strip cools down immediately after the contacts short circuit because the neon discharge stops and much less heat is generated from the i r loss in the metal as compared to the neon discharge the starter contacts open before the tube fires actually the tube fires as a result of the back emf generated in the ballast because of this immediate opening of the starter s contacts a capacitor is connected in parallel with the contacts to prevent excessive arcing during the firing the neon reionizes but does not draw sufficient current to prevent firing of the tube itself mustafa kocaturk mustafa seas smu edu ee dept room a caruth bldg home office smu box dallas tx

re what do nuclear site s cooling towers do nagle netcom com john nagle writes great explaination however you left off one detail why do you always see them at nuclear plants but not always at fossil fuel plants at nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle whereas fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot water as i recall the water isn t as hot thermodynamically in many fossil fuel plants and of course there is less danger of radioactive contamination actually the reasons you don t see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are fossil units multiple units per plant are generally smaller than nuclear plants mwe seemed to be a very popular size when many fossil plants were built the average nuclear plant is mwe many fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were adopted why those old dirt burners can t harm anything let em go powered draft cooling towers low enough to the ground to be generally not visible from off site are quite popular with fossil plants fossil plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears actually fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual boiling water reactor nuclear plants there s a gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses vintage steam technology so it s more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system as cold as possible hence big cooling towers oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers but they usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water not most of the way down to ambient some plants do cool the condensers with water rather than air as one canadian official asked about thermal pollution de icing a river said up here we view heat as a resource actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants of similar size the issues are the same regardless of where the heat comes from condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine the condenser pressure is normally water s vapor pressure at the condensing temperature it is desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity causes erosion of the condenser tubes the coldest and thus lowest pressure condensing environment is always the best a related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell where the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes since the condenser is at a very low pressure the only force driving the condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity if the condensate is too hot or the gravity head is too low the condensate will reflash into steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate this is a particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all costs the hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps how much lower they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in the hotwell typically hotwell temperatures run between and degrees depending on the temperature of the river water this term is used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water is pumped when the river water temperature is high in the summer operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order to provide more gravity head there is a tradeoff involved since higher hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the condenser area at least in the east and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the air the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge water from the cooling towers the temperature of the discharge water from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and humidity it is very rare in the east to hear of actual river water temperatures exceeding degrees a vast difference from the typical days degrees humidity we see routinely in the east it is not unusual particularly where the econazis have been successful in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant for the plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive pressure everybody runs closed cycle boilers the water used is purified of solids which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when the water boils purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than cooling it so the boiler water is recycled true actually secondary plant the part that makes electricity and feeds feedwater to the boiler water chemistry has been the bastard stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves the plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood the costs of impure water by impure i mean water with a few dozen extra micromho of conductivity and or a few ppm of dissolved oxygen secondary water is now typically the most pure one will find outside the laboratory john john de armond wd oqc

re what is zero db in article apr bnr ca moffatt bnr ca john thomson writes joseph chiu josephc cco caltech edu wrote and the measure of current amp is actually named after both the amp company and the amphenol company both companies revolutionized electronics by simulatenously realizing that the performance of connectors and sockets were affected by the amount of current running through the wires sorry the unit for current is the ampere which is the name of a french man named ampere who studied electrical current the term amp is just an abbreviation of it the company amp came after the ampere unit was already in use the ohmite company was the first to characterize resistances by numbers thus our use of the ohms i don t know about this one but it doesn t sound right are you two joking is the entire internet flaming you two ahh now i remember that ohmite company was the first introducing the pink colored resistor only for electronics working females manuel arrevola velasco true e mail manolo taf fundesco es dod
re adcom cheap products aaron lung alung megatest com wrote i was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far east or where ever but if you look in the amp and see what components they use and how it was designed you can easily see why the amplifiers sound so brilliant good point also i wouldn t be surprised that the components they use off shore are of inferior quality as long as it was properly designed and robust premium components are used it shouldn t matter where it is assembled definately i agree wholeheartedly if they can build the amp where the labour is not so expensive they can afford to put decent components in and go to more effort to improve the design of the amplifier as adcom has done i cannot see why people say the amplifier won t last not with those quality components inside sure the amp runs very fairly hot but that s how you get an amp to sound incredibly good an amp that runs hot has no bearing on how it s gonna sound the amp you have probably is running class a the whole day actually i d be wary of excessively hot amps cauz even though the components inside may be rated to run that way excessive heat will dramatically shorten the life of any electronic component regardless of quality in fact an amp that does run hot to the touch is because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs hmmmmm sure i didn t mean to imply that because of the heat generated the amp sounds good my adcom gfp ii runs fairly warm not hot to the touch but enough to satisfy me that the amp is running nicely i don t like it when an amp runs dead cold it makes one think that the amp is doing nothing the heatsinks that adcom uses in their amps are certainly far for skimpy they re massive things with heating vents both below and above more than enough to carry away excessive heat my opinions once again alan webber webb itu sun ac za webb itu sun ac za the path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high the ravens all are watching from a vantage point near by apprehension creeping like a choo train up your spine will the tightrope reach the end will the final couplet rhyme

how does differential mode gps work i understand that the new gps boxes now have an option known as differential ready apparently land based beacons tranmit gps correction information to your gps receiver with differential option installed how does this system work what frequency is used for the land based beacons thanks in advance charlie thompson here s a rough sketch of how the system works a reference station with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the incoming gps signals these errors are due to several factors including atmospheric distortion sa selective availability time dithering etc the reference unit contains complex computational equipment to back out the errors in its position since it knows where it is already it then transmits these corrections on a broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local receivers if the receivers are nearby km and are using the same satellites as the reference unit the errors should be very similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit thus the receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference unit the us coast guard is currently as far as i know installing a series of coastline transmitters for differential gps these stations will use existing radio towers i believe the frequency is to be approximately khz there are many other private corporations offering dgps signals on different frequencies for example pinpoint offers correction signals and receiver units using an fm broadcast system which has stations all across the us the correction codes are usually transmitted using the rtcm format advertised accuracies espouse to meter errors john p baker my opinions are my own i don t know johns hopkins university anyone else who wants them anyway applied physics laboratory laurel md bakerjp aplcomm jhuapl edu

re radar detector detectors it is illegal to use anything you eavedropped on for a business or for an illegal use jurisdictions that ban radar detectors or police monitors are essentially making the claim that there is no other reason for a radar detector or police radio monitor the results of fighting these claims in courts have been mixed the federal courts are not anxious to intervene and state courts have sometimes held that the feds have exclusive jurisdiction and sometimes they have not a lot of state courts do not have enough imagination to see any use for a radar detector besides avoiding law enforcement action for speeding when you buy a radar detector amongst the guarrantees instructions explanations and other detritus is an invitation to join an association dedicated to preserving your right to use a radar detector i promise i am not making this up i do not think radar detector manufacturers would be making any headway at all in courtrooms if police departments enforced speed laws with a strict eye to public safety and a blind eye to the fund raiser aspect of tickets mike coyne

need help with video detection circuit i am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video vs a blank screen by monitoring the r g and b outputs of a graphics card it should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at mhz which would mean detecting a ns pulse it should also be able to tell the difference between a blank screen about mv and a dim screen say around mv oh yes it also needs to be cheap my first circuit was a dismal failure i used compariators each compariator had the input going to one of the guns the input went to a reference created by a voltage divider a potentiometer the first problem was that the compariator was way too slow i needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the compariators so i could have a whole screen full of text but my circuit would not detect it the second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen in fact the difference between completely black and completely white is only mv i am wondering if i am going to have to amplify the video signals to make this work there are faster compariators but they are expensive and require split supplies i would need to replace my quad compariator with three compariators and create a whole new power supply circuit at this point i think what i need is some sort of transistor circuit transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick unfortunately i am way out of my league when it comes to designing transistor circuits so i am appealing to the net for help any ideas tips circuits pointers references etc would be greatly appreciated oh yes i only sample the output of this thing every second or so so i don t need a fast response time at all however i haven t found a way to take advantage of that fact thanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give of course you will have my undying gratitude steve verity steve verity maxed on midi verity jack sns com

re building a uv flashlight in article c r lz n panix com jhawk panix com john hawkinson writes one other thing a friend of mine mentioned something about near uv light being cheaper to get at than actual uv light does anyone know what he was referring to i don t want to get into a semantic argument but contrary to some other postings near uv light is actual uv light the near means that it is close to the visible spectrum i e of relatively long wavelength not that it is nearly uv i m sure you can figure out now just what far uv is regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of uv in the near end of the spectrum such that a filter can be used to remove the visible light and thus create a weak uv source stronger sources are going to require gas probably mercury vapor discharge tubes such as fluorescent tubes with uv phosphor be careful though strong uv sources can cause physiological damage especially to the eyes the shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous it wouldn t project a beam like a flashlight but replacing the tubes in a portable fluorescent lantern with uv tubes would be a relatively cheap way to create a portable source it would be bright enough to be useful but not dangerously so ed hall edhall rand org

re minimal boolean circuit in article apr ringer cs utsa edu djimenez ringer cs utsa edu daniel jimenez writes suppose we have a boolean function which is a minimal sum of products derived from a k map or something like this f a b c d bc d acd abc ab c the books on logic design i have consulted all seem to imply that this is where the analysis ends but by factoring out the a term in the function we can get fewer gates f a b c d bc d a cd bc b c which yields gates yes but the minimization of gates is important in part because of timing considerations a ttl gate has the basic structure of and or invert and an inversion of a sum of a product is just exactly one gate delay the reason to find a minimal sum of products is that this matches a hardware optimization a positive or gate such as the gate solution uses has two gate delays and there s another gate delay in the second term so that the second solution while simpler in logic symbols can be expected to be something less than optimal in the real world ecl is similar to ttl in that it can support an or and gate with the minimum delay unlike ttl you get both true and inverse outputs for free when using ecl pals are basically large programmable and or invert gates with your choice of internal connections between the various sections and perhaps some latches so a minimum sum of products also is a way to shoehorn a logic design into a few pals it s not comparably easy to design with a minimization of logic gates but some software packages claim to allow you to do so and will take just about any mess of gates as a nodelist with xxx series logic ics and produce a description of a logic cell array to do the same job xilinx s xact software does this by treating each logic block as a macro and expanding it all out then simplifying john whitmore

food dehydrators does anybody out there have one of those food dehydrators i ve been seeing all over late night tv recently i was wondering if they use forced air hea or both if there s heat involved anybody know what temperature they run at my wife would like one and i m not inclined to pay for a box a fan and a heater seems to me you should be able to throw a dehydrator together for just a few bucks heck the technology is only what years old you can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book the hungry hiker s guide to good food by gretchen mchugh the heat source is a watt light bulb basically it s a vertical wooden box with ventilation holes in the top and bottom lots of them you want the air to flow the light bulb goes in the bottom and wire cake racks are spaced every starting about above the bulb or at a slightly higher cost in electricity you can do what i do use your oven note i do this in an electric oven some gas ovens may not have a low enough setting put food to be dried on cookie tins or racks in the oven set oven to degrees the lowest setting on my oven if yours goes down to that s probably even better stick a wooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close the door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch this allows for airflow leave the stuff in the oven for to hours check it often since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator if you are using cookie sheets instead of racks turn the stuff over halfway through if you want more info e mail me since this isn t really the right sub for this stuff gerald belton ozonehole com slmr i still miss my boss but my aim is improving the ozone hole bbs a private bulletin board service full service nodes usrobotics k bps gigs files skydive new orleans rime network mail hub usenet newsgroups please route all questions or inquiries to postmaster ozonehole com

mc sbi mixer mjm hi i was wondering if anyone would be able to help me on twwo related mjm subjects i am currently learning about am fm receivers and recieving mjm circuits i understand a lot of things but a few things i am confused mjm abuot the first is the mixer to mix the rf and local oscillator mjm frequencies to make the if does anyone have any cicruit diagrams as mjm simple as possible for this kind of mixer i have come across a mjm mc sbl mixer chip but i have not been able to find it in any catalogs mjm active etc mjm along the same note are there any simple fm receiver circuits anyone mjm may have stashed away somewhere and they couold let me see mjm p s any really good books on am fm theory along with detailed mjm electrical diagrams would help a lot mjm i have seen a lot of theory books with no circuits and a lot of mjm circuit books with no theory but one without the other does not help digi key has the ne chip which has a local oscillator and mixer on one chip for a great combination of theory with actual circuits the best reference for non engineers is probably the radio amateur s handbook from the arrl most library s have it in the reference section slmr if ignorance is bliss why aren t there more happy folk the ozone hole bbs a private bulletin board service full service nodes usrobotics k bps gigs files skydive new orleans rime network mail hub usenet newsgroups please route all questions or inquiries to postmaster ozonehole com

re los angeles freeway traffic reports i live in the san francisco bay area and word has it that something similar is on its way here since we apparently don t have the sensor base you folks have they re installing cameras at strategic points along the freeways initial tests are going to be in the santa clara area i m told with the video being piped into a command center they re building somewhere in the east bay i m not sure if frame grabbers or cheap labor will be used to interpret the data but large multi colored status displays will show the various routes using different colors to represent the various average speeds for each stretch of highway an announcer will sit in front of the status wall and will relay continuous verbal traffic status to those who want to receive it they re apparently also looking into licensing a low am frequency to be dedicated to providing continuous audio from this system in the mean time they ll set up large incandescent display boards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data on traffic conditions up ahead my understanding is that the system is subsidized as a pilot program and information from it will be available free of charge perhaps the la system is similarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate read cheap we also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the sap audio channel of television channels and these are verbal reports qualified with a identification tone to tell in vehicle receivers like the auto talk that the information coming next is applicable to a given area in la they re probably using some other tv channels but the concept is the same try setting your stereo tv or vcr to receive the sap audio channel and go station jumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information i believe this program is also subsidized making the in vehicle receivers cheap to purchase and without having to incur monthly fees to use it since the makers of these in vehicle receivers don t have to pay for the broadcast this may not be completely true they likely have no investment in keeping the system up and running when the cal trans stuff hits the airwaves you may have a nifty little tv audio receiver in your car nothing more when this happens perhaps a word to the wise i think we d all be interested in a summary post if you get more info on how the la system is networked and paid for cheers alan acooney netcom com

voltage regulation and current limiting one not so quick question to throw out there for you guys for our class project we need to design and build a power supply to the following specs voltatge adjustable from v current limited at a voltage must stay within of designated value for i from a ac ripple less than mv rms of course we can t just use an adjustable voltage current limiting regulator chip our problem is with the current limiting i e we ve found stuff to do the rest of the parts of the circuit what the supply must do if presented with a load which would draw more than a given the supply voltage is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal one amp thus if we were to short the thing with the ammeter we should read one amp if we measure the current through a ohm resistor at v we should read one amp and the output voltage by necessity must be v the only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output power transistor and therefore reduce the output so does anybody have any ideas we could work from thanks in advance andy collins kc yey acollins uclink berkeley edu ps if anybody wants to flame this as a stupid project i agree fully but i still have to do it its graded
re membrane keypad with custom legend try the folks at dimolex corp la crescenta ca their number is they make membrane keypads that are very flat in layouts from to keys they have standard models tactile models with stainless domes under each key to make a click you can feel as well as backlit models some of them can even be cut with scissors to form a funky shape other than a rectangle many of the models are available in a kit which includes a bezel colored and plain key covers and rub on lettering to make your own layout one piece prices aren t cheap though as they want for one four position pad kit and for a position kit i have no affiliation with dimolex or any company connected with them i have purchased a couple of keypads from them and am pleased with what i got cheers alan acooney netcom com
re building a uv flashlight in article c r lz n panix com jhawk panix com john hawkinson writes my main question is the bulb where can i get uv bulbs do they need a lot of power etc etc i ve seen them in surplus stores all they are are fluorescent bulbs without the phosphor and a uv transparent bulb special glass i ve also seen incandescent versions that you screw into an ordinary vac socket probably not what you want i m not too concerned with whether it s long wave or short wave but hey if anyone has a cheap source of bulbs i ll take both one other thing a friend of mine mentioned something about near uv light being cheaper to get at than actual uv light does anyone know what he was referring to as far as i know near uv as opposed to far uv is longwave uv near the visible spectrum longwave uv is safer as far as accidental i hope exposure to the eyes as far as fluorescent minerals go the reason a friend has a uv lamp some only respond to only one of short or long uv hope this helps dave thanks much john hawkinson jhawk panix com who i am david malecki who you think i am dramalecki electrical watstar uwaterloo ca
re decoupling caps onboard i ve used on chip capacitors to reduce ground bounce noise on a small systolic array chip that had pf loads on the clock lines design was in micron n well cmos using the mosis scalable design rules here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors they don t help much with simultaneous output switching there is still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the load capacitor on both the signal line and the ground return so you still get ground and power line bounce they do help a lot with on chip loads as i had with the high load on the clock lines the transients you are trying to suppress are really high frequency so forget about large areas of poly thin oxide diff capacitors since the rc time constant is too large what i did is to make a metal metal poly diff sandwich but put a lot of holes in the poly layer allowing frequent diff metal contacts i forget exactly how wide the poly lines were if i were doing this design again i d probably omit the diff altogether and use a solid poly sheet instead using just m m and poly and substrate but that has such a high resistance it can be ignored at these speeds you are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings especially for output signalling than spending chip area on capacitors i had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for a mosis tiny chip and the next size up was twice as big as i needed kevin karplus kevin karplus karplus ce ucsc edu due to budgetary constraints the light at the end of the tunnel is being turned off
