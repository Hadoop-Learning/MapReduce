in case a deal is a lemon hi to all since all of you could also be a seller as well as a buyer i d like to bring this issue for discussion what would be the best solution in case a deal became a lemon as i understand most people selling things over the net do not grant a warranty i am in such a situation that the seller did not state whether a warranty would be granted or not and the item i received is out of order the seller insisted that it was in good condition when he sent it and so would just return half ofthe amount that i paid if i send the item back to him and after he is sured it is bad is this reasonable basically i would like to believe the seller tells the truth also i am positively to say that i ve not done anything wrong which might cause the failure of the thing my assumption here is everyone is honest so rule out the possibility that either one of the two parties or both are liars i would like to hear your opinion either in here or directly respond to my e mail address i know there is such a risk that you could lose money but how can we make it enjoyable to most people and not wasting the bandwidth chein

re car stereo stolen i had the front panel of my car stereo stolen this weekend i need to buy the front panel of a sony xr u car stereo if by any chance anyone has had the body of a sony xr u stolen and has an otherwise useless front panel i would love to buy it from you if you know anyone who had a removeable front panel car stereo stolen from them could you please forward this message to them thanks kris i was my understanding that the purpose of those removeable front panels were to make the radio useless and thus discourage theft that is if the cover were removed by the owner and taken along whenever the car was left if those covers were sold for anything remarkably less than the radio originally costs or even sold at all then the above discouragement wouldn t be so great i personally would be unhappy if i bought a radio like that thinking that removing the cover greatly depreciated the radio s value and the covers were sold by the company or other legitimate source cheaply if you cut here you d ruin your monitor kenneth d ray expert someone who knows more and more crc ocis about less and less and finally rice university knows everything about nothing

re printing jack previdi p psilink com writes in reply to dorothy heydt reminding us that advertising is not done on internet as a matter of fact d j it does make a difference almost a half million new users joined the internet last year many of them are commercial businesses the ban on commercial use of internet is no more jack there is a difference between using the network for commercial purposes and advertising in newsgroups business communication is okay advertising to hundreds of thousands of users around the planet who have no desire to receive advertising is not okay those of us who pay for internet access are constrained only by our innate good taste and no have no administrator to guide us i suspect that a site which generated a large volume of material not in anybody s good taste would find itself getting a lot of attention it didn t want you may belong to the public library but that doesn t mean you can deface the books disorder the stacks or disturb the other patrons you re constrained by the same rules that the rest of the users many academic and military who get irritable about a network for which they pay with tax and grant money carrying private business advertising follow there are secret masters here just like everywhere else they re not as obvious as the ones on prodigy but they re here no doubt at some point the internet like everything else will become grotty enough to carry advertising at that time i hope it is confined to its own newsgroups and not on discussion groups like misc writing elizabeth willey

re is itproper net etiquette to advertise a company s junk mail list in article apr leland stanford edu thomper leland stanford edu dale buford thompson writes my company maintains a mailing list which is regularly rented for oh no someone is provided useful information and mentioned that they made money in the field don t they know that usenet is reserved for uninformed speculation by people trying to sell their personal stuff from houses to dead pcs at a huge markup trying to unload stuff they bought from their company at just under retail and other non commercial activities a ms windows utility product in the range and is available through direct media in ct at per name please let your direct mail marketing rep know about this thanks it is my impression that net etiquette does not allow companies to use the net to directly advertise their products the net is not supposed to be a dumping ground for free ads but reserving it for tripe doesn t seem to be a significant improvement in addition to improper etiquette this product is a mailing list used for generating junk mail so either they target it well enough to pay for it in other words they manage to send it to people who want the stuff in which case it is junk only for the rest and the transaction costs are borne appropriately in this case or they go bankrupt seems fair to me am i correct in assuming this is improper and if so what can be done to penalize such an improper use you could hold your breath you could kill offending messages as they come onto your machine and refuse to send them any further but not until you turn blue andy

re question suggestion for everyone please read if both paries do this then the transaction will obviously be cod this allows both parties to exercise the amount of trust they see fit cod is fine until the buyer opens the box to find they paid for a brick or if it the seller allows for a personal check to be used on a cod it s fine till a stop payment is made there are few methods to protect both buyer and seller in any sort of transaction even with merchants and customers there are problems stolen credit cards chargebacks no return policies and getting the wrong item etc about the only protection available to to do business with someone you trust someone who has been around for a while jeff jeff freeman go porch toll free front porch computers voice rt box fax chatsworth ga compuserve id internet jfreeman frontporch win net

re expen ive motorola handheld radio for peanuts agent x writes i can no longer use anything japanese kenwood yeasu icom alinco its all junk well i m not sure i d go quite that far but i agree that motorola gear is of better quality the question is how much that quality is worth to a ham in amateur service not commercial service this radio can hear a repeater thats miles away without an antenna ok great but how often does that come up how good is good enough and how much is someone willing to pay for it a good ham quality ht is maybe while a commercial quality one is maybe is the increased reliability and performance worth times the price in amateur service only the individual involved can answer that question and each ham has to decide for him herself if motorola quality is worth times the price to you then more power to ya but i m amazed that folks make that choice for me given that i ve got to spend i l pick the yaesu ht and a nice new hf rig every time over a motorola ht alone no matter how good it is to me ham quality gear is good enough to each his own mike n pdy these are my opinions only

re saturn s pricing policy in article c vir l r shuksan ds boeing com fredd shuksan fred dickey writes carolinafan uiuc cka uxa cso uiuc edu wrote i have been active in defending saturn lately on the net and would like to state my full opinion on the subject rather than just reply to others points the biggest problem some people seem to be having is that saturn dealers make k on a car i think most will agree with me that the car is comparably priced with its competitors that is they aren t overpriced compared to most cars in their class i don t understand the point of arguing over whether the dealer makes the k or not i have never understood what the big deal over dealer profits is either the only thing that i can figure out is that people believe that if they minimize the dealer profit they will minimize their total out of pocket expenses for the car while this may be true in some cases i do not believe that it is generally true i bought a saturn sl in january of at that time based on studying car prices i decided that there was no comparable car that was priced as cheaply as the saturn sure maybe i could have talked the price for some other car to the saturn price but my out of pocket expenses wouldn t have been any different what s important to me is how much money i have left after i buy the car reducing dealer profit is not the same thing as saving money show me how reducing dealer profit saves me money and i ll believe that it s important my experience has been that reducing dealer profit does not necessarily save me money fred say you bought your saturn at k with a dealer profit of k if the dealer profit is then you would only be paying k for the same car so isn t that saving money moreover if saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by then their cars will be even better deals say if the price of a saturn was already below market average for the class of cars then after they reduce the dealer profit it would be below market average it will attract even more people to buy saturns because it would save them money force the competitors to lower their prices to survive now not only will saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit even the buyers for other cars will pay less isn t that saving money doug

svx oil change my friend brought a subaru svx recently i had drove it for couples times and i think its a great car esp on snow however when she took it to a local subaru dealer for a oil change the bill came out to be about dollars the dealer told us it is because to change the oil filter on a svx it is necessary to disassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour at first we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in toronto but found out the they are charging roughly the same price so is there any svx owner out there that has the same problem and if the oil change story is true then the engineer of subaru looks pretty stubid to me by the way the car looks great swd wan

re braindead drivers who don t look ahead i agree that if traffic is all blocked up and you want to pass you might not feel like moving over for someone behind you because you don t want to give them that one car length when they should just wait like you are but if you re one of those people that just sit s behind the person and doesn t flash them with the high beams or pull left and flash them or ride their bumper or otherwise tell them that you do in fact want to go by and you re not just drafting them then get the hell out of the way of someone who will i especially hate it when you flash someone at the back of a line and they don t pass it on and there s also the issue of some cars being more intimidating to get people out of the way than others for instance gts look pretty mean in a rearview mirror at night with the foglights on there have been plenty of times when i ve broken up a pack that a second in line hyundai has been behind for miles you just need to know how to get their attention i d like to see you use this method on a couple of semi drivers if they see you they usually acknowledge by sticking their hand out the window with their middle finger extended because it is also obvious to them that there is no clear lane ahead h h m
my day in court results a while back i asked for help in defending a traffic ticket i received in short the ticket was for not stopping at a stop sign given the conditions i could not stop in time and decided instead of sliding right through the intersection i would complete my right turn and avoid a possible accident a police cruiser happened to be approaching the intersection from my left and gave me the ticket the officer said the only reason that you even slowed down in the first place was that you saw me approaching otherwise you would have bombed right through i would like to thank all those who responded favorably to my request for help to all of those who told me to bite the bullet and pay the fine phghghghgh the judge sided with me and decided that in this case not stopping was the safest thing to do and found me not guilty the officer s statement and my account of the conditions at the time very slippery backed by newpaper weather conditions were the factors what made the judge decide on his verdict moral if you have never been to court before and you think you have a case go for it it is a very interesting process and it is there for your benefit exercise your rights trev name trevor paquette landmark ita fahrvergnuegen email tpaquette ita lgc com calgary alberta canada visitor from cyberspace g renegade of virtual reality include disclaimer h o o

re electronic odometers was used bmw question i consulted with someone working on an electronic odometer the design was to use a microprocessor based system to write a somewhat ofuscated pattern into an eeprom the idea was to make the circuit difficult to program arbitrary values into the eeprom the secondary purpose acutally the primary purpose from the standpoint of practicality was to distributed the writes so as to avoid exceeing the maximum number of writes fof the eeprom being used the microprocessor also ignored pulses coming from the hall effect at a rate any higher than mph so as to make spoofing the reading by bench pulsing at least somewhat undesirable this was for an automobile that was not expected to ever exceed mph in operation the case of course might not be the same for your rx the ecm modules of some cars do indeed store info about conditions under which cars have been operated since steering angle and velocity data etc is available it would not be difficult to collect all sorts of interesting demographic information about the drivers use of the car i am not aware of any manufacturer currently trying to enforce warranty restrictions based on reading out use data from the ecm while it could be a potential invasion of your privacy for manufacturers to have access to data about your driving style it could also provide valuable information from actual field use conditions to help engineer more appropriate cars i personally wouldn t mind the dealer collecting my driving demographics as long as it is done in an anonymous fashion bill mayhew neoucom computer services department rootstown oh usa phone wtm uhura neoucom edu n wed

after market cruise controls specific questions howdy i m a little new to this newsgroup but i would like to tap some of the knowledge and expertise available here the subject after market cruise controls the background i recently broke my ankle in a road bicycling accident places five screws yuk in two weeks i will be returning to texas my home from my school byu in provo utah as you can imagine trying to drive nearly miles with a broken right ankle isn t just the epitome of a good time my car does not have a cruise control so i would have to do all the pedalling ha ha with my messed up ankle my question what is the general opinion of after market cruise control units i realize that a cheap cc cruise control from say pep boys isn t going to be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit if there is such a thing and i uderstand that i probably can t expect much in the way of accuracy looks and that sort of thing but anything s gotta be better than trying to drive with a hosed ankle i have a jeep cherokee speed standard l engine with kettering sp ignition y know distributor cap rotor that set up not electronic maybe you could ve guessed it being an but i m just trying to give information as completly as i can i found a cc unit for bucks it seems to use the vehicles vacuum system instead of an electric servor motor is this good or bad if i did buy this cc which vacuum hose should i tap it has two speed sensors one magnetic and one that gets a signal from the negative side of the distributor kinda like a tach pick up or so i understand i can use either one which is best the manual says i read it in the store today that the magnetic axle set up is more accurate but harder to install is there really a big difference it has a sensor for the brake pedal just like other ccs but does not have a sensor for the clutch pedal so if i wasn t paying real close attention i might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up which would wind the engine up kinda high until i got my wits about me and turned the thing off i m pretty coordinated so this doesn t bother me if it were for my girlfriends car then it would bother me but i m ok with it the installation also calls for an attachment to a steady on brake signal and a switched on brake signal i think i can get a switched brake signal from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse am i right but i m not sure where to get the steady on brake signal or for that matter what exactly it is any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get it i think i can figure the other things out like how to hook up the negative side tach type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit and the ground and all that miscellaneous business but i need a little help with is it worth the money and safety risk if any for such a device is there any particularly good after market cc are professionally installed ccs signifacantly better and worth the cabbage if the unit i saw sorry no manufacturer or model number just that it is at pep boy and its is sufficient for my simple needs how do i get the thing installed properly specifically the questions above my father and i built a veep volkswagen powered jeep cj a when i was in high school so i consider myself fairly good with tools electronics and cars so the installation doesn t scare me i just want to be certain that i get the thing installed correctly as my cherokee is just a wee bit more complicated than my veep i appreciate your time in reading my post and i would appreciate any expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject if you would like to share some of your wisdom please email as i don t get over this group very often but i check my mail all the time again thanks for any help anyone may have mike wieda mikew canc byu edu

rec autos welcome to to the new reader archive name rec autos part most recent changes march addition of alt autos karting rpw welcome to rec autos this article is sent out automatically each month and contains a general description of the purpose of each of the automotive newsgroups and some suggested guidelines for discussions the keywords monthly posting will always appear to make killing this article easy for users of newsreaders with kill facilities this article is posted to all autos groups but followups are directed only to rec autos if you don t understand what this means ask your system administrator for help or at least for copies of the newuser documentation failing that please subscribe to the newsgroup news announce newusers and read the documentation provided there introduction to the rec autos newsgroup hierarchy rec autos tech is intended for technical discussions of automobiles their design construction diagnosis and service other discussions are largely inappropriate especially for sale ads rec autos sport is intended for discussion of legal organized competition involving automobiles technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply to competition vehicles discussion from either of two viewpoints spectator and participant is encouraged arguments about sports cars are largely inappropriate as are most other discussions for sale ads are inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and or equipment discussions of illegal events are marginal one should probably avoid advocating breaking the law remember the fbi reads usenet rec autos driving is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles also if you must discuss vs or radar detectors or insert your pet driving peeve boneheads do it here rec autos vw is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership of automobiles manufactured by volkswagen this includes vws audis seats etc it was created on the grounds that the info vw mailing list was very successful it should not be presumed from the existence of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many different marques groups specific to individual marques should only be created on demonstration of sufficient interest via some avenue such as a mailing list rec audio car is not properly part of the rec autos hierarchy it is however the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment and so is mentioned here rec autos antique is intended for the discussion of older cars usually more than years old although this is not a hard and fast rule alt hotrod is not part of the hierarchy but also of potential interest to the rec autos reader it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing list and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing performance vehicles alt autos rod n custom also not part of the official hierarchy devoted to that peculiar american hobby of customizing older cars alt autos karting for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby karting rec autos is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics crossposting crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on the newsgroups line in the article header such articles will appear in all of the newsgroups listed crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on usenet you should only post to a group because you feel an article is appropriate you should never crosspost just to reach a particular audience this distinction is subtle but important radar detector articles for example are more or less appropriate in rec autos they are almost never appropriate in sci electronics or rec ham radio and the fact that you might want to reach the audience in sci electronics or rec ham radio is not adequate justification for posting to either group crossposting between any or all of the rec autos groups is usually inappropriate if you find yourself doing so consider whether or not it is truly advisable before sending your article consider setting followup to to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost crossposting between rec autos and misc consumers is chancy at best in particular flame wars over the speed limit in the us and or the use of radar detectors should never be crossposted between any of these groups most readers of sci electronics and rec radio couldn t care less about the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in rec autos it is an excellent idea to check the newsgroups and followup to lines of articles before posting a followup in particular be wary of posting to misc test rec arts startrek or talk bizarre or any combination of these three the life you save may be your own distribution there is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to partially control where the article goes it is called the distribution field it may be very useful for many reasons it should also serve as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system the distribution of rec autos is fairly extensive as of this writing the automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of europe australia new zealand and some locations in japan with this in mind i offer the following hints about use of the distribution field in your article headers and on article content please take care not to send for sale ads about clapped out ford mavericks in new jersey to france or california i doubt that anyone in either place will care except for my girlfriend who for some strange reason likes mavericks but only door mavericks at that when posting technical questions please include the market for which your car was manufactured for example there are a number of differences between a european market ford escort and a us market escort likewise all cc and early cc alfa romeos reached the us with spica fuel injection european market cars usually got carbs often webers these differences can be important to your readers make your situation clear failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant spread of misinformation be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting in the us we get a mix of metric and english system values whereas europe is almost entirely on the metric system a future edition of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly used abbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec autos reaches this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it use the distribution field to limit where your article goes when possible within north america the values na north america can canada and usa may be used in addition the two letter state abbreviations of the us are supported in some cases e g if i wanted to send an article only to new york and new jersey i could put ny nj in a distribution field note that multiple comma separated values are legal these distribution fields vary widely however so you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely to be supported in your area the dangers of overgeneralization to amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars tires etc what is true for a buick with a cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a honda with a cc engine headlight laws in sweden are decidedly different from those in idaho the need for adequate specification when you ask a question please give a reasonable amount of information e g if you have a question about your honda please specify year model engine size etc otherwise most answers to your question may be quite useless concerning lemons at one time or another every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or two even honda admits to this please don t waste everyone s time by announcing to the world that your brand x automobile is terrible so all brand x automobiles are terrible so no one should ever buy a car from the brand x company such articles are worse than useless because they cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful information concerning flames as much as we might wish it a flame free newsgroup is something that most likely will never occur here are some guidelines for flames and how to deal with them a list of flame prone topics follows in the next section of this posting if you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory don t imagine for a minute that including the words no flames will work it won t and you ll get exactly what you deserve if you re going to flame you re more likely to get away with it if you can cite a fact or maybe a well known reference no one is likely to believe bald unsupported assertions be careful about who you choose to insult consider not insulting anyone asking the question it is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like please send email i don t read this group it is a much better idea to end the question with please send email if there is sufficient interest i ll summarize the results in a later posting i may miss posted responses to this request answering the question if someone wants to hop up their yugo don t tell them to

rec autos frequently asked consumer automotive questions archive name rec autos part this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions the other article contains questions more geared to the automotive enthusiast and so is not crossposted to misc consumers rpw changes as of april revised brake fluid section as non silicone dot fluids are now apparently available rpw commonly asked automotive questions tire questions q what do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean a typically you will see something like hr the is the overall width of the tire in millimeters the tread is usually narrower the is the aspect ratio it indicates the height of the sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width our example tire has a sidewall height of mm the is the wheel diameter in inches there are also some special tires called trx tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations like which is in millimeters the r means radial and the h is a speed rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire when properly inflated and carrying an appropriate load may safely operate common speed ratings are s mph t mph h mph and v up to mph recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed rating to a different part of the designation you may therefore find designations like r h the indicates the per tire load associated with the speed rating exceeding this load in continuous operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice what follows is a table showing a number of load indices and corresponding maximum per tire loads load index max load kg note that the usual mass vs weight confusion occurs in this table in some cases the letters p or lt may be found in front of a tire size the lt designation indicates light truck and the p designation indicates passenger car if no letter is given then the application of the tire is passenger car usage as far as i know these letters only appear in the us market the lt designation is prinicipally of interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles for the owner of a passenger vehicle there is no meaningful difference between a tire with a p designation and one with no designation at all if the aspect ratio is omitted it is probably but may be tires with an ms mud snow designation may have their speed rating reduced by km h about mph there is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature traction and treadwear temperature and traction are graded a b and c with a the best and c the worst treadwear is a numeric rating these values are of limited value as they are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires q my car has tires with a funny size designation hr can i put normal tires on the car a your tires are called trx tires they were devised by michelin because of a somewhat different bead design they are incompatible with normal tires michelin used a different diameter wheel for them so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel and so that more conventional tires could not be mounted on trx type wheels you will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your car it is barely possible to fit normal tires on trx wheels and horribly dangerous to do so the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner or possibly blow out at high speed trx type tires are becoming hard to find in addition to michelin avon makes suitable tires goodyear has apparently discontinued their line of trx tires q can i rotate radials from side to side or rotate them only on one side of my car a car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject many say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a car is now ok this group includes michelin and goodyear others for example pirelli and nokia will void warranties if such swapping is done the best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before rotating your tires and stick to the manufacturer s recommendations q how many snow tires should i buy and if i buy which end of the car should i put them on a in short and both ends to explain many drivers in areas that don t get excessive snow or who don t drive agressively or at all in snow conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels but there are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice with a rear wheel drive car you can choose between being able to start the car going a function of the rear axle or stopping and turning the car a function of the front axle in a front wheel drive car you start stop and turn with the front end the primary risk of putting the snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes while going downhill you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards radar detectors and speed limits q why aren t there any comments on radar detectors and speed limits in this q a posting a because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between misc consumers and rec autos always start long tedious and pointless flame wars if you want to talk about either of these topics please subscribe to rec autos or alt flame and keep it there safety equipment q do airbags really work a preliminary statistics suggest the following airbags work much better than no belts good point belts alone work much better than airbags alone and airbags point belts work slightly better than point belts alone the con to airbags is that some designs tend to burn the driver s hands when venting the byproducts of the explosion that occurs inside the bag and that some designs but not all may knock the driver s hands from the wheel making retention of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult brake questions q do i always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned midas always wants to do this a no there are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing rotors some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors more often than is strictly necessary if the rotors are not warped warped and only lightly grooved then there is no need to replace or to turn them note also that some rotors the rotors on many hondas are a good example are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical to turn them they must be replaced when they become too thin warped or badly grooved q they tell me i should downshift when braking to slow my car down is this really a good idea a it used to be a very good idea back in the days of mediocre fade prone drum brakes in modern disc brake equipped cars use of downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary except in cases of long steep downhill runs otherwise modern disc brakes are more than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances and they are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings on the other hand many standard driver s license tests in the usa still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking i suggest that before taking a us driver s test you either learn to do this smoothly which takes some time and practice or borrow a car with an automatic to take the test q how often should i replace my brake fluid a probably more often than you do traditional brake fluids tend to absorb water this water can corrode internal parts of the brake system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid dot type are older fluids dot and dot are newer specifications the principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points the dry boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid but the wet boiling point is important in older brake fluid dot fluids have the lowest wet and dry boiling point requirements dot fluids have better boiling point requirements and dot fluids have the best boiling point requirements but dot fluids are not clearly superior see the next q a for more details while the requirements imply that dot fluids are better than dot fluids there may be specific cases where a dot fluid is preferable but these are mostly competition applications otherwise dot type fluids offer much improved brake pedal feel replacement once a year is recommended for dot fluids although agressive drivers may profit by changing out fluid more frequently or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid out of the brake calipers fairly regularly q what about dot brake fluids a this breaks down in to two parts the dot specification looks excellent for performance but the first dot fluids were silicone based silicone fluids are a tricky proposition unlike dot and dot fluids they do not absorb water at all while this may sound like a feature the problem is that any water present pools up in such systems interfering with braking performance and corroding any metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring the water will tend to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers where most of the corrosion occurs because of this phenomenon it is essential when converting to silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly beforehand some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the brake system when converting to silicone fluids two other issues that come up with silicone fluids they are difficult to pour cleanly that is without air bubbles which interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel and while they generally have much higher boiling points than dot fluids they do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable in effect from boiling dot fluids silicone fluids may make sense in some street car applications but they are certainly not recommended for high performance driving applications and the economics are questionable for street use i have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the dot standard that do not contain silicones these fluids appear to be reasonably compatible with the older dot and dot fluids but i have little information at this time q abs is available on some of the cars i m looking at but it costs more is it worth it a this does not have a cut and dried answer therefore this answer will be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons the short answer is that abs costs more both initially and to maintain will generally work better for the average driver that is to say a driver who does not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques and may require the unlearning of some obsolete braking techniques like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case now for the long answer abs works by monitering the wheels of the car looking for signs of locked brakes it may or may not be able be able to distinguish between the different wheels there are several systems on the market it cannot detect impending lockup which is what you would really want in an ideal world but only the existence of lockup the sensors used vary some of the less well designed sensors are sensitive to tire size and to brake pad material and may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original equipment or oe equivalent components when the sensors detect lockup the abs system responds by unlocking the brakes either individually or all at once depending on the system if the driver keeps their foot firmly planted the abs will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states if a sensor existed that could detect impending lockup then we could sit right at that point which is where maximum braking effect is achieved this pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal as the system cycles the percentage of the time that the brakes are truly engaged is called the duty cycle typically in an abs system this is about on dry pavement a trained driver can beat this duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking on wet pavement braking is so chancy that abs will outperform threshold braking nearly every time unfortunately on mud and on snow often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes locked only audi of the manufacturers producing abs equipped cars has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the abs system for this eventuality a particularly important feature of abs is that it preserves steering control this is the case simply because if you are braking near the limit and turn the wheel the abs will release the brakes if it sees steering triggered lockup and back off on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied braking distances will lengthen accordingly an important caution abs cannot exceed the maximum theoretical braking force in any given situation if you start sliding on glare ice don t expect an abs system to help you out very much the coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an abs system in your car as far as maintenence goes in addition to the potential restrictions i ve listed above you have to worry about the following parts costs are much higher the oe master cylinder for my obscure european sedan lists for but the oe master cylinder for the abs equipped version of the same car lists for over most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of dot silicone brake fluids in abs equipped vehicles because of the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system components regular i suggest annual replacement of brake fluid becomes very important q what about this threshold braking business a normally i d not put this in the consumers q a but recent publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers in abs equipped chevy caprices suggests that this section is needed here rpw threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high performance drivers if made a habit it replaces the stab the pedal and lock em up panic habit entirely and is much to be prefered basically the premise is that tires generate maximum braking force when they have just started to slide but just before the wheels lock up entirely drivers who threshold brake learn to feel what this threshold feels like and learn to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake pedal in many cars you can feel that you are near the threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it in any case if you can t hear the tires whine just a bit you re not very near the threshold in a car with abs often there is a twinge in the pedal just before the system starts cycling if the driver backs off on the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt then they are very close to the threshold and they ll probably achieve better stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the abs take over recently there has been a rash of publicity over a number of accidents and one death involving police cars equipped with abs systems the police departments in question quickly blamed the new abs systems but according to autoweek magazine it now seems clear that the problem was a lack of training none of the involved officers had any recent performance driving training there is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing brake pedal by pump braking an old and discredited technique of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal the goal being to try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system if you think about it for a minute you ll realize that pump braking must cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least so if you cut the duty cycle of an abs system by that much you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective and useful technique regardless of whether your car has abs if you do fear a failed hydraulic system then one or two stabs at the pedal will be sufficient gas questions q does high octane gasoline help a maybe maybe not some cars have knock sensors and can adjust the engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used on most cars however you should use the cheapest gas that makes your car run well check your owner s manual for details on what your car needs q my car was made for leaded gasoline will unleaded gas hurt it a it is possible that unleaded gas may slightly increase valve wear although the amoco oil company argues otherwise the actual increase in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable however as modern leaded gasolines actually contain very little lead you should however check your owner s manual many cars from the early s do not actually require leaded gasoline q do fuel treatments help what kind should i use a some do and some don t during the winter it is a good idea to use dry gas however some may be harmful to fuel injection systems never use an additive containing methanol sometimes called methyl alcohol such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection manufacturer s opinions vary on additives containing ethanol sometimes called ethyl alcohol if your car has fuel injection check the owner s manual on your car before using these most manufacturers consider ethanol acceptable in gasoline additives with isopropyl alcohol isopropanol and petroleum distillates are fine in fuel injected cars an occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with fuel injectors although many premium gasolines contain detergents that do the same job some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain ethanol or methanol always check the ingredients before putting anything in your gas tank there are a small number of particularly good additives these are noticeably more expensive that the run of the mill ones but work much much better among these are chevron techron redline sl wurth lubrimoly ventil sauber and bg k a bottle of one of these once every six months is highly recommended q what about detergent gasolines a the quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat bmw has instituted a testing program and gasoline brands which pass this test may advertise that fact stickers indicating passage of the test are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations if such gasolines are used then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional beforewarned that while use of bmw approved gasolines will keep a clean engine clean they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits lubrication questions q what do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean a there are several different items encoded there is a two letter code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer uses in the oil this looks like se sf cd or such the s codes are for gasoline engine applications the c codes are for diesel engine applications the second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels of protection are developed thus sf is considered better than se se is considered better than sd and so forth the more noticeable designation is the oil weight this is either a single number e g weight or a pair of numbers separated by the letter w e g w the latter type is much more commonly used these days and are the only type that most automobile manufacturers specify in operators manuals the first number in the designation w is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold the w stands for winter the second number is the viscosity of the oil when hot there is a trick here the oil doesn t actually get thicker turn from weight to weight as it gets hotter what is actually happening is that when the oil is cold it has the viscosity of a cold weight oil as it gets hotter it doesn t get thin as fast as a w oil would by the time it is up to temperature it has the viscosity of a hot weight oil note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities not all w oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold and not all weight oils have the same viscosity when hot note also that the novel behaviour of multi grade oils is caused by additives and it has been reported that with the sole exception of castrol gtx w oils do not retain their multi grade characteristics well over time w w and w oils work very well though q are quick lube places any good a some do adequate work but there are quite a few incompetent ones out there let the buyer beware watch them while they work make sure that they don t overtorque the oil drain plug and keep your hand on your wallet at all times q are oil additives like slick or tufoil any good a slick and tufoil are ptfe based additives many of these have come onto the market recently they are different from the moly based additives that have been around since the early s ptfe is the chemical name for teflon tm a trademark owned by dupont in general auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products most usenet responses to questions on these additives are favorable slight increase of mpg after application smoother revving but long term results whether ptfe additives are effective after k miles are debatable some manufacturers such as saab claim that either the product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage some bmw owners have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of slick to their cars this writer has been cautioned by a slick dealer that slick should not be used in japanese motors as it may clog the oil return passages in the engine otherwise there are no known reports of damage caused by ptfe additives on the other hand there are satified slick customers in the world q do synthetic oils really work a yes but more specifically most auto manufactuers accept synthetics but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by oil manufacturers auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your car even if you decide to try the longer intervals at least change the oil filter at regular intervals as synthetics get just as dirty as conventional oils synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter entirely amsoil redline and agip are very highly regarded and very effective mobil synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews however q manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals how often should i change my oil a it depends on how you drive if your car always or nearly always gets warmed up and you don t drive it very hard and keep the revs down the manufacturer s recommendation is probably fine if however you drive it hard drive it at high revs or alternatively if you only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn t get up to temperature then you may wish to change oil much more often perhaps at mile intervals given that most manufacturers are now specifying mile intervals if you don t drive your car much at all say miles a year then you probably want to change oil every six months anyway if you are storing a car during the winter then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out of storage misc questions q my car has a timing belt i hear that bad things happen when they break what s the story a it depends on the internal design of the motor early ford escorts for example will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks but the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt some honda motors will not be damaged but others will be if no replacement interval is specified for your car then change the belt at least every miles some cars may require more frequent replacement ask your dealer or independent mechanic also ask if there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time for example the same ford escorts that suffer valve damage also have a timing belt driven water pump which has been known to seize destroying the timing belt and which then causes major valve damage as a side effect replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water pump can be a costly mistake q why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it self destructs when the timing belt breaks a for performance reasons compromising piston design so that the valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression ratio of the engine be reduced significantly this is why you are more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance oriented vehicles q what causes unintended acceleration a the final report of the national highway transportation and safety administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the same time be consistent with the physical evidence the nhtsa report goes on to conclude that pedal misapplication by the vehicle operator is probably the cause richard welty welty cabot balltown cma com nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of a race car about either its pitch or roll axis carroll

militech i saw an interesting product in ny auto show and would like to hear your comments militech tm is yet another oil additive but the demonstration of this product really impressive if it didn t cheat the setup of the demo is fairly simple a cone shaped rotor is half submerged in a small oil sink filled with motor oil the rotor is powered by an electronic motor a metal pad is pressed against the rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction the torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench before militech was added the rotor was stopped with about lb ft of torque you pick the brand of oil no difference once militech was added to the oil the rotor could not be stopped even with lb ft of torque here is the good part even after the salesman emptied the oil sink you still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained on it they say you need only add oz per quart of oil every k miles a oz bottle is i still have my doubts if this product is really so great why it was so little known the salesman said it is widely used in military i didn t believe it the demo was so impressive that i bought a bottle against my common sense has anyone heard of or actually used this product is it real if you are going to the auto show please visit this stand on the second floor see if can find out if the demo is a hoax or not jason chen

rec autos frequently asked questions archive name rec autos part this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions the other article contains questions of general consumer interest and is broken out to facilitate crossposting to misc consumers rpw last change february ct now permits radar detector usage new tire traction q a rpw commonly asked questions radar questions q where are radar detectors illegal a in the us currently virgina and the district of columbia prohibit all usage of radar detectors new york prohibits their use in large trucks in canada they are illegal in manitoba ontario quebec newfoundland and pei prince edward island they are apparently are illegal through most if not all of europe legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other jurisdictions chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal q where are radar detector detectors used do they really work a usage is spreading rapidly initially they were used only in canada but now they are appearing in new york and virginia it is unsafe to assume that they are not in use in connecticut and d c they work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently available super het radar detectors some brands of detector radiate more strongly than others and are thus more likely to be spotted new radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected by the current generation of detector detectors note that a detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned on q what is vascar is it some kind of radar a vascar is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time speed distance computer it depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target vehicle passes landmarks no radar signals are emitted by a vascar system q what is ka band radar where is it used should a radar detector be able to handle it a ka band has recently been made available by the fcc for use in the us in so called photo radar installations in these installations a low powered beam is aimed across the road at a degree angle to the direction of traffic and a picture is taken of vehicles which the radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle because of the low power and the degree angle many people believe that a radar detector cannot give reasonable warning of a ka band radar unit although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such capability anyway the number of locales where photo radar is in use is limited and some question the legality of such units best advice learn what photo radar units look like and keep track of where they are used or else don t speed q do radar jammers work are they legal a quick answer no and not in the usa detailed answer cheap radar jammers do not work well at all jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the military jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the federal communications commission of the usa driving technique and vehicle dynamics questions q what are understeer and oversteer a understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a car while cornering near the limit limit of adhesion that is most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to be descriptive of the situations they encounter simply put they tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner steer less or understeer or it wants to turn more in a corner oversteer understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that untrained drivers inadvertantly traveling too fast won t get into trouble understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle in a corner oversteer is designed into some more performance oriented cars it may be induced by lifting on the throttle trailing throttle oversteer or tto in extreme cases lifting on the throttle may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or spinning some technical details in a corner at speed the tires on the car will develop what are called slip angles the slip angle is the angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to travel in understeer the front wheels have a greater slip angle than the rear wheels in oversteer the rear wheels have a greater slip angle than the front wheels q what is a rev matched downshift a when downshifting the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear than it was in the higher gear however during a downshift normally you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle so the revs drop rather than increase in rev matched downshift you blip the throttle before re engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to the new speed this results in a much smoother and faster downshift q what does heel and toe mean a heel and toe is a technique used to do a rev matched downshift while braking this is normally challenging because you need the right foot for both the brake and throttle it is called heel and toe because you use one end of the foot on the brake and the other on the throttle to match revs for the downshift in many modern cars this is a misnomer often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side on the throttle note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch and just use the left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle accomplishing the same thing q what is double clutch downshifting a while your right foot is doing the above your left foot can do one of three things nothing declutch once or declutch twice the reason for declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the transmission to the speed of the engine this is usually coupled with rev matching so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch engaged the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission speed up the procedure is as follows declutch move gearshift lever to neutral engage clutch match revs declutch move gearshift lever to next lower gear engage clutch this sounds like a lot of work but with practice it becomes natural the problem that double clutching solves is normally the function of the synchronizers within the gearbox in transmissions without synchros or with very worn synchros double clutching makes it much easier to shift basically if you double clutch well you are not using the synchros at all this is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good condition q what do the numbers for acceleration from mile skidpad and slalom times in the auto magazines really mean may they be compared a in short not as much as the magazines want you to believe and almost never in more detail the acceleration numbers mph and mile times in the us may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the same source testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine that comparing a road track number to a car driver number is quite pointless keep in mind too that the same variation applies from driver to driver on the street the driver is a major often the major part of the equation skidpads vary and even if they didn t skidpad figures are really only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires they change radically when tire compounds change do not make any assumptions about the comparative handling of say two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers this is not to suggest that skidpads are without value however skidpads are an excellent educational tool at driving schools they are simply of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires slalom times are slightly more useful they test some small parts of the automobile s transient response however they are also heavily influenced by the stock rubber on the car and they do not test many corners of the car s envelope they do not tell you all you need to know before making a buying decision for example they don t tell you what the rear end of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off camber when a car has an adjustable suspension these tests are usually done in the sport setting which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving the list of caveats could go on for page after page q my buddy claims that wide tires don t make any difference according to his freshman physics textbook and that you can t ever accelerate or corner at more than g does he know what he s talking about a in short he hasn t got a clue in more detail the equations for friction used in freshman physics textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth dry and non deformable none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating temperature pavement is never smooth it is always irregular to a greater or lesser extent tires which are not really dry and solid as rubber is a substance which in its natural form is liquid and which has only been coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic deform to match the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over in a tire at operating temperature grip is actually generated by shear stresses inside the deformed rubber and not by anything even remotely resembling friction in the freshman physics sense of the term the colder a tire is relative to its operating temperature the closer its behaviour will be to the traditional concept of friction if much hotter than the its proper operating temperature the more likely the possibility of some part of the tire actually reverting to liquid which is mostly like to happen deep in the tread causing characteristic blisters and chunking this latter though is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal street driving so unless you re a competition driver or do a lot of high speed track driving don t worry about it because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all thus dragsters accelerate at more than g and race cars corner and brake at more than g because simple friction does not apply it is actually possible for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of grip an actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques such as finite element analysis due to the complexity of the mechanism misc questions q what does name or acronym stand for a here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked about be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names as misinformation abounds on the net in

re manual shift bigots in article c o nh su news cso uiuc edu mchaffee dcl nxt michael t chaffee writes w r t performance converter lockup is purely irrelevant the lockup only occurs at light throttle settings and serves only to improve mpg mind you a converter clutch does a lovely job of improving mpg but the additional mechanical advantage of the converter gives you more acceleration vs locked converter clutch than its inherent losses take away the transmission in my car contradicts both your assertions i get much stronger acceleration if i let the convertor lockup which i can induce by briefly lifting off then quickly but not too quickly to trigger a kickdown applying throttle above rpms the convertor will never unlock it would kickdown first who says there s no skill involved in driving an automatic i think of it as the throttle and shifter combined into a single pedal with my car i can pretty much influence its shifting patterns with my right foot while having both hands to steer eliot

record clean state illinois cost mos i turn in may and the insurance goes down to mos also i m single and that incurs a higher rate with my company i ve got a couple other friends w awds and they pay

three moving violations in the last months one for going in a one for failure to clear an intersection i still say the damn light was yellow and one for going in a which didn t go on my record my rates from state farm with a passive restraint deduction on liability deductible comprehensive and deductible collision are roughly year i was paying just over year for a escort lx james james p

thunder t bird sc it s a hell of a thing killing a man you take away all he has and all he s ever gonna have will munny unforgiven i am beyond the under age group but i have an experience a few years ago that might be interesting to you i owned a toyota celica gt i decided to buy myself a gift a more exotic car front runners included the toyota supra turbo and the porsche model years i narrowed it down to those two i liked the simplicity and handling and snob appeal too of driving a porsche the supra turbo was less money and had more features and performance almost a personal luxury car it had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the i was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the but i decided to stop by my insurance agent s office on the way i asked about what would happen to my rate with either car if you buy the supra your rate classification will be the same as the celica the celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars with a slight increase because the car will be years newer our lower risk division will continue to handle your account if you buy the porsche we ll have to change you to the standard higher rate company and your rate will double and if you go with a it s another story again we ll cover the rest of this year but cancel you after that but the supra is much faster than the and the is actually faster than the standard that doens t make sense that s what the book says we don t insure corvettes either for some reason the underwriters consider supras and their drivers as very traditional and conservative i eventually went with the supra for a number of reasons the porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested but a tough high pressure guy in the back room at equal monthly payments it would have taken a year longer to pay for the porsche plus its higher insurance i concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft everyone s entitled to my opinion goldberg oasys dt navy mil imagination is more important than knowledge albert einstein i live in idaho when i was many years ago years i bought a trans am new insurance was about year when i turned it immediately dropped to year i had not had any accidents before or after this was strictly an age change that same rate stayed pretty much the same until i sold the car years ago my f pickup is about year less the real amazing thing is that when i woke up at age i felt so much more responsible than i was before wes for your information california male single under no moving violation alfa

moved to the absolute best it would go down to about if i moved to the worst it would be also one accident and a couple of tickets would probably add another rv i have a mitsubishi eclipse turbo awd am years old and have no tickets that went on my record i live in illinois just outside of chicago and pay a year with full coverage at state farm i did get a small discount because of my alarm system

total k property with deductible glass and towing state farm unless you are under or have been driving for less than years i think you are being seriously ripped off i don t have one of the performance cars you listed but if your record is clean then you should not be paying over k did you try calling all the insurance dealers you could find although rates are supposed to be standardized i ve found that most places i initially call give me some ridiculously high quote and finaly i hit one that is much lower also i have changed insurance companies when the rate went up at renewal no

re improvements in automatic transmissions an excellent automatic can be found in the subaru legacy it switches to sport mode when the electronics figure it not when the driver sets the switch which is the proper way to do it imo so what does sport mode entail several things revving to red line or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy delayed upshifts i e if you lift off briefly it will remain in the low gear this is handy if you are charging through corners and would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there s another curve approaching part throttle downshifts based on the speed at which the pedal is depressed rather than the position of the pedal modern electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about to turn red my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough also i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage than a dumb driver with a stick all else being equal remember that the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation how many times have you ridden with an inattentive driver cruising on the highway at in th gear of a speed how many of people who drive manuals really know what the best gear to use is for every conceivable situation i m sure there will be some who know but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with all possible scenario ratio combinations stored in rom is likely to do better i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout high gear low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear high revs and small throttle opening the explanation is quite simple if one sits down to think about it but not that obvious at first sight eliot

re rfi art of clutchless shifting jong halcyon com barking weasel writes schludermann sscvx ssc gov writes my technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift lever if for some reason i miss the shift window i lightly press the accelerator try agian i ve found that clutchless shifting is eaiser quicker at high rpms i also skip gears some times using sounds about right i usually slip it out during throttle down and then blip the throttle and wait until it feels like things are right usually about a second and then slip it into gear so how did you guys learn this is it something you were born with or did you make horrible grinding noises the first few times how many times i would think you d have to have a certain amount of feel for it to begin with some people would never get it and others like me would never have the guts to try it unless maybe you were planning to buy a new transmission anyway btw i ve heard that quite a few truckers and race car drivers shift this way zaphod madnix uucp ron bean uwvax astroatc nicmad madnix zaphod

re too fast jimf centerline com jim frost writes there are a few things to keep in mind about europe since you brought it up my autobahn knowledge is admittedly second hand but i believe the following to be true my knowledge about driving in the u s is also second hand but i think i can correct your statements about our autobahn drivers are much better disciplined in europe than they are here oh yeah that would be paradise in fact you can forget it from all i ve heard from my u s relatives drivers esp here in germany are much more agg ressive but not disciplined one of my relatives a l a resident hired a car at the nuernberg airport and went about miles to our home he said then that he grew about year older during this ride and swore he d never drive a car in germany again this was in and he kept his promise the situation now is even worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic what you mean by better disciplined should perhaps be considered cautious due to fear when driving around here you always have to take into consideration that the majority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you they expect that nobody fails or sleeps many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can go of course only where that is allowed you might think dream on so any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health and if you re ex posed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver you learn to handle it or you lose that s the way i and most people i know experience our traffic situation whether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you i think we handle a very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest compared to the volume and decreasing rates of lethal accidents otoh more and more people esp women dislike driving because they feel overtaxed and threatened and each accident is one accident too much the roads comprising the autobahn are much better designed than they are here and usually include animal fences this makes them far more predictable than most us highways better designed and maintained may be but animal fences are very rare auto bahnen and many other streets have guard rails i hope that s the right word a plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights it s about feet high those guard rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road smaller animals can crawl under the plank bigger ones can easily jump over it the point is that esp larger animals are very rare in germany they tend also to be very timid accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger not all of europe is the autobahn most places in europe have speed limits that aren t out of line with what we used to have in the us if my friends weren t lying to me they re typically not much higher than km h you re right there are speed linits even on the major part of the autobahn but the attitude towards driving see above seems to be very similar to that in germany i ve been in france switzerland italy austria spain belgium the netherlands besides that you really can t rely on the residents abiding the local speed limits i ve got quite a lot of practise k miles and i m used to travel at mph fyi with a car even smaller than a rabbit but i consider driving on the highways round paris or milano really a thrill i strongly suspect you won t find a lot of rabbit owners doing mph nearly km h on the autobahn but i could be wrong sorry but you ll find quite a lot rabbit class car or even smaller mine is a peugeot owners going that fast small cars with much hp are very hip over here and most people buying such cars aren t afraid to let them run some people have no respect for their own lives i disagree the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant formula cars weigh less than kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at mph or higher otoh when crashing against a solid object at mph it makes no difference whether you sit in a porsche a mercedes a tank or on a bicycle your re dead bye stefan stefan dalibor dalibor immd uni erlangen de and now for the next case in kangaroo court i accuse you of being the reincarnation of adolf hitler i don t think that mere denials will be sufficient you will have to submit to examinations by a parapsychologist that i personally select perry metzger pmetzger shearson com in article in news admin policy

re ford probe opinions centered around the gt in article apr sco com nathanp sco com nathan writes jeremy g mereness zonker cmu edu says can anyone offer any opinions of the ford probe ala how they do in the long run repair records reliability mileage etc i am fixing to buy a car in the next few months aiming toward something a little bigger than a typical small car and with a little more power i am considering the mx probe accord corolla and the sx i bought a probe gt with the pep a last july now at miles after debating over the sentra se r nx mx mr stealth prelude and celica the car design is different than earlier years so it s too early to see its reliability so far for what it s worth my comments my dislikes shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal some other owners on the ford probe world std com mailing list have commented about this problem but i haven t seen it happen on my month old probe gt i think this may be something that ford has corrected since the initial batch of cars also someone said that ford has issued a service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem so you may be able to get your dealer to fix it headlights have stuck up a few times weather air conditioning broke miles pressure cycling switch condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn t drain completely haven t seen any of these problems nor have i seen these mentioned on the mailing list so these might just be having bad luck with these crammed engine little hope for do it yourselfers typical definitely parts somewhat more expensive than normal ford parts underside plastic doesn t like sharp driveways and speedbumps typical assembly gripes tape on radiator screw fell out of dash seat seams not stitched properly hopefully just a fluke no problems like these either i haven t been able to find any obvious places where they screwed up ford only gives key with the car c mon ford spend an extra few pennies hmmm i got two keys with my car something tells me you got stiffed by your dealer on this actually if you count the credit card key that came in the owner s binder i got keys but since the credit card key doesn t have any teeth cut in it yet i guess i won t count it rear hatch has no padding on corners when up i m waiting for the day when i bash my head on the corner horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference the latter is probably because of the air bag it s pretty much takes up all the space where you d expect to find the horn speaking of the horn i was surprised to find that the probe comes with one of those nice merican sounding horns instead of the japanese sounding kind the previous probes had japanese horns tires fling dirt mud onto side of car yeah not very badly but enough to be annoying sometimes my likes engine design valves sounds smoothness power mileage torque definitely handling very good for fwd understeer only at limits transmission the speed is a must usable instrumentation lovely readable analog everywhere very little torque steer at full power much better than the sho i drive stability at mph high gearing though low cowl good visibility in front heated outside mirrors nice in fog never tested in freezing weather abs air bag see above rear seats fold down i have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important no shake rattle noises when going over bumps potholes still tires vr goodyear eagles left hoping for k i agree strongly with all of the above especially about the engine the interior is very very nice too very pleasing to the eye and ergonomically sound i drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads and most noticable thing is that the probe s suspension doesn t like potholes when you test drive one find a potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable yes this car s stiff suspension isn t for everyone i personally like it but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car i d strongly suggest looking into the mx if you have passengers by all means bring them along too they ll find that they have no room in the back and you ll find that the car rides differently if that s better is up to you the problem with the back seat is that there s no leg room plenty of head room though shorter people fit back there without any complaints so long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to give them a place to put their feet also there s a lot of glass around you which i wasn t expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer my back seat passengers now very few complain about the lack of ventilation you may want to consider that when combined with the heat the power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car i really enjoy the moonroof by the way but then i ve always been a sucker for open air driving no leakage problems or anything like that yet i ve heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine i haven t heard about this one i know that some of the very early probes and maybe had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers which ford will replace at no charge but i haven t heard about anything like this concerning the probes i haven t had any real trouble with this car outside of a cv joint boot that was leaking but the dealer took care of that promptly and even gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that i was without my car i was quite happy with the way they handled especially considering that i was expecting the worst from them from what i ve heard it sounds like ford mazda had some qc problems with the probe and probably mx when they first went into production but i think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point that s almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this though hope this helps chuck chuck kesler internet chuck eos ncsu edu unix systems programmer us mail box ncsu campus engineering

re ford probe opinions centered around the gt jeremy g mereness zonker cmu edu says can anyone offer any opinions of the ford probe ala how they do in the long run repair records reliability mileage etc i am fixing to buy a car in the next few months aiming toward something a little bigger than a typical small car and with a little more power i am considering the mx probe accord corolla and the sx the probe is the youngest of the bunch thus my interest in opinions but every magazine and ratings book places it as an excellent value btw the sx is rear wheel drive and is due for a re design for thanks in advance while i don t read normally read this group i was looking for valentine radar information sigh maybe in the faq and came across your posting i bought a probe gt with the pep a last july now at miles after debating over the sentra se r nx mx mr stealth prelude and celica check this month s consumer reports for previous probe records my criteria a fun car with abs airbag over hp and less than k i thought about a turbo but checking with insurance people ruled that out the tri star cars eclipse talon etc were out since they don t have an air bag ditto for the mustang also no abs the se r nx m fell into the pocket rocket category a good used car buy the mx was almost there but rolled more than i liked i didn t like the prelude dash instrumentation at all too weird for me the mr has a much smaller non passenger space than i needed so out that went the celica was ok but underpowered when loaded with options and somewhat overpriced too in non turbo form i never considered the sx since it didn t have an airbag i did look at it for its rwd virtues but that s it the corolla never entered my mind i should have looked at the mitsubishi vr dodge stealth more since my list was exhausted i bought the probe the car design is different than earlier years so it s too early to see its reliability so far for what it s worth my comments my dislikes shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal headlights have stuck up a few times weather air conditioning broke miles pressure cycling switch condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn t drain completely crammed engine little hope for do it yourselfers typical parts somewhat more expensive than normal ford parts underside plastic doesn t like sharp driveways and speedbumps typical assembly gripes tape on radiator screw fell out of dash seat seams not stitched properly hopefully just a fluke ford only gives key with the car c mon ford spend an extra few pennies rear hatch has no padding on corners when up i m waiting for the day when i bash my head on the corner horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference tires fling dirt mud onto side of car my likes engine design valves sounds smoothness power mileage torque definitely handling very good for fwd understeer only at limits transmission the speed is a must usable instrumentation lovely readable analog everywhere very little torque steer at full power much better than the sho i drive stability at mph high gearing though low cowl good visibility in front heated outside mirrors nice in fog never tested in freezing weather abs air bag see above rear seats fold down i have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important no shake rattle noises when going over bumps potholes still tires vr goodyear eagles left hoping for k as you can see i m primarily interested in the engine while it doesn t have the uummmph of a big liter car or the turbo rush the big selling point for me was the all aluminum value liter engine the overall car is a good buy for the money that market segment hasn t changed much since july prelude vtec honda del sol i drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads and most noticable thing is that the probe s suspension doesn t like potholes when you test drive one find a potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable if you have passengers by all means bring them along too they ll find that they have no room in the back and you ll find that the car rides differently if that s better is up to you also there s a lot of glass around you which i wasn t expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer my back seat passengers now very few complain about the lack of ventilation you may want to consider that when combined with the heat i ve heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine leather and the keyless entry system weren t available when i got the car so i can t comment on them i got the car before it was officially announced i prefer cloth to leather anyway i wouldn t want this car in the snow the suspension is too rough for the inevitable surprise potholes tires aren t meant for snow and the seats assume that you re not wearing lots of thick clothing rain is much better water generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed the windshield wiper controls are easy and understandable and i barely hydroplaned once with the eagles and i was really trying there is also a definite lack of cup holder small storage places the gt has map holders below the speakers in the door but they re rigid plastic that could fit two cassettes or cd s max the center console storage bin arm rest has cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth pouch but that s it no change holders quite a let down from the sho and the probe is definitely not a people mover car or an econo box car lastly don t store wet car covers in

re eagle talon tsi lemon in rec autos jay lorenzana u uicvm uic edu wrote dear netters i am looking to buy a used eagle talon or tsi awd i would be concerned about how the car was driven and how well it was maintained i own a turbocharged one and i would never buy a turbocharged vehicle unless i knew the owner and his her driving maintenance habits question is that the tsi awd was mentioned in the april consumer reports to a car to avoid i have been wondering about that myself the awd models and the s were identical except for the abs option in particular the manual transmission yes some owners had problems with the transaxles using synthetic lubricants in the transaxles solved the problem in most cases the problem was not unique to the awds however it was common to all models the galant vr and gsx had the same transaxle but i didn t see those listed in cr electrical system i don t know of any major complaints in this area except that the battery that was installed at the factory had a low current rating and brakes were below par in both models the first fwd models those built before may were recalled for brake upgrades some fwd and awd owners had problems with warped rotors those of us who insist on using manual torque wrenches every time the lug nuts are tightened have never had a problem a friend of mine ownes a tsi awd and he has had brake jobs pads i can refer you to someone who has gone through a set of pads in one day it all depends on how you drive it seems that most owners have been getting between k on a set of pads one stuck valve first time i hear about a problem with the valve train on these cars other than timing belt failures and some clutch transmission problem something about sticking grinding into second gear this doesn t seem too bad if one beats on his car if your friend beats on the car then his unit is not a representative sample of the car s reliability my suggestion is instead of listening to the useless consumer reports talk to several owners the mailing list may be the best way to reach a few of them i am willing to suffer reliability for speed and looks seems you have to pay big buck if you want all three anyway can anyone please let me know how you like your talon and any problems you may have had and if the repairs are worth it if humor impaired skip to theend no matter how much you pay you won t get all three examples nsx reliability and looks ferrari reliability h h h h h h yeah right speed and looks theend the opinions stated above are not necessarily my employer s roberto l landrau kc yp landrau mitre org rll linus mitre org the mitre corporation bedford ma rll linus uucp
is car saftey important i was recently thumbing through the lemon aid new car guide what i found was a car would be given a recommended under the picture while a few sentences later noting how a driver and passenger were virtually guaranteed to be killed in a front end collision the most highly recommended small car the civic has the worst crash rating of all of the small cars listed there were many such cases of great vehicles where you wouldn t survive an accident is it only me or is safety not one of the most important factors when buying a car
re renting from alamo in article apr ericsson se etxmst sta ericsson se writes hello netters i m visiting the us i m from sweden in august i will probably rent a chevy beretta from alamo i ve been quoted for a week for additional days this would include free driving distance but not local taxes baltimore they also told me all insurance thats necessary is included but i doubt that cause a friend rented a car last year and it turned out he needed a lot more insurance than what s included in the base price but on the other hand he didn t rent it from alamo does anyone have some info on this is a rip off no that sounds pretty reasonable for that car and that city probability that i ll be needing more insurance unless you have an accident you won t need more if you plan on paying for the car with a credit card check and see if your card automatically covers rental cars also your own auto insurance may cover rental cars also most rental companies here offer extra insurance when you rent and require you to initial in several spots if you don t want it the credit cards and personal auto insurance provide the same sort of coverage that the rental agency is trying to sell i have never rented from alamo so i don t know if they follow this same practice is the beretta a good rental car yes it is a compact door probably a bit dull performance and acceleration wise but very adequate it will have an automatic transmission am fm stereo air conditioning and possibly power windows and door locks joe joseph staudt telxon corp joes telxon com p o box usenet is like tetris for people who still akron oh remember how to read x j heller
re manual shift bigots in a previous article eric youngblood says in article apr engr washington edu eliot stalfos engr washington edu eliot writes race car stuff deleted back to the f stuff for a second note that the auto tranny in f still shifts at the driver s command not some preselected schedule the driver still controls the shifting not the transmission now there is no dispute that in production cars automatics are inherently more lossy than manuals that is in theory my point all along is that whatever mechanical advantages a manual has over an automatic can very easily be lost by a driver who isn t skillful or one thing that gives an automatic an advantage at launch is the fact that it has a torque converter vs a clutch i know this sounds strange but a torque converter multiplies the engine output when launching it functions as a sort of limited continuously variable transmission typically you get a torque multiplication of to times depending on the stall speed i have yet to see a torque multiplier installed on a production automobile such systems do exist but none are presently installed in production autos that i am aware of these are commonly called viscous drive cvts or fluidic amplifiers contrasted to a clutch which merely slips when feathered result is no tq mult what the convertor does allow is for the engine to be closer to its torque peak during the launch before a clutched car can fully engage it s driveline chevy proved it many years ago with the camaro ets and terminal mile times were close enough tpo be identical for speed and auto cars note that this is also the major reason that an auto car can get away with fewer gears than a manual the slip in the convertor makes up for the fewer ratios and before everyone starts yelling about the proposed sspeed autos soon to be out note that some manufacturers are using speed manulas now once past lauch however the converter begins coupling and the tq multiplication effect is reduced but by then you should be on the cam correct al bowers dod alfa ducati hobie kottke blad iaido nasa well goodness sakes don t you know that girls can t play guitar mary chapin carpenter

bbb autoline arbitration my bbb autoline arbitration experience is over the outcome was decidedly mixed i won the battle but lost the war the arbitrator found that the car was defective but decided to offer a repurchase well below market value at the time of the hearing average retail on my truck in the nada book was but the decision was for i wrote a letter to the council of better business bureaus pointing out the fact that if you have an automobile that does not depreciate rapidly the manufacturer has no incentive to deal with you there is no way that the manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded a repurchase the attitude of chevrolet s representative at the hearing tends to support this point of view he was totally unprepared and did not seem to take the proceeding very seriously i decided to take the repurchase even though i am getting totally screwed on the price i will not have to deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon myself and i have no case for a civil suit based on the idaho lemon law i am planning to send a letter to my elected representatives telling them how utterly ridiculous the idaho lemon law is the law allows for a use deduction equal to the irs mileage allowance as if chevrolet were buying my gas and paying for my insurance summary of the case in may i bought a new ton hd chevrolet pickup between may and december this vehicle required repair after repair systems that required attention included the transmission heater fan paint suspension and motor the main problem was the five speed manual transmission they could not install a non defective transmission in at least four attempts so in summary it is possible to get a repurchase but you are going to get screwed on the price unless you paid too much in the first place or if your car happens to be a model that depreciates rapidly jackw hpdmd boi hp com

re manual shift bigots in article c liw cax news rich bnr ca peon w o email eric youngblood writes in article qn lo c s vela acs oakland edu mje pookie pass wayne edu michael j edelman writes the big disadvantage of automatics is the hp they consume that never gets to the wheels in this respect they are at a disadvantage to a manual only when the torque converter is not locked up there are autos out there with converter lock up in nd rd and th gears dont forget that now that new speed manual trannys are available the drive train is more optimally geared to get the most out of the engine rare so are speed autos but very real bottom line is both manuals and automatics have vastly improved i think that automatics have advanced far more than manuals especially in shift intelligence i say that a smart automatic is better than the majority of drivers in terms of being in the right gear at the right time which to me is more important than torque converter losses i prefer the stick for fun and the auto for traffic who says you can t have your cake and eat it too a well designed shifter will easily facilitate manual clutchless shifts i am referring to the much copied mercedes jagged gate the only department where you lose out is in the number of ratios available and of course the converter losses if ayrton senna can drive a racecar with fully automatic transmission it can t be half bad eliot

for k as an ex fleet mgr of cars they were amoung the most trouble free of all models i bought one for my wife nnnnnnnng thank you for playing i cannot agree with this i believed this and to put it nicely it was a piece of junk i loved this car i babied it i pampered it and after years it just couldn t stay together i would say that not everyone will have the problems that i had but know this it s not just the car it is the ability to get the car fixed which will not happen at any chrysler dodge take your pick dealer i don t care if there are going to reform their dealers service with the intro of the lh cars i will believe it when i see it case and point the local dodge dealer you drive up just looking you don t even get out of your door when about yes salesman all eye you like their next meal and literally pounce on you and try to get you to make a deal on everything your eye wanders towards service is about times worse than that i had an alignment problem but they tried to tell me that the k frame was bent and about dollars of work parts to fix it let me tell you the problems i had and i took care of this car i put alot of miles on it in the first couple years but took it to every checkup it needed and many that shouldn t have been dodge shadow es these were replaced within the years that i owned the car engine alternators rear suspension torsion bar water pumps thermostats hall effect sensor main computer batteries these were rebuilt repaired radiator automatic transmission power steering those are just the things i can remember off the top of my head for about a year before i sold the car i said to myself it s a good car i just can t find anybody competent enough the fix it in the end before i traded it in for a saturn the power steering started acting up again i just stopped putting money into it i must have put at least worth of repairs over it s lifetime i am sorry but lee iacocca can bite me bullshit whoever backs em best is just afraid the stupid things are going to fall apart and no one will buy them without assurance why the hell do you think that lh has been nicknamed last hope you can do better and i know people will disagree with me here but japanese like honda or toyota or the only american car company that i feel is a quality product saturn i will not touch another chrysler product again no way i don t care how good the lh cars look good and i will admit they look promising but not with the support that you get gm isn t much better thank god they don t control saturn like they do their divisions or it would be just another marketing ploy don t get me wrong i will be watching my car which i do like like a hawk for the next years i am much more hesitant to say it or any car is really good until it has proved itself to me but since someone else pointed out c d as a source i will note because i used to read these magazines that car and driver has never had a good thing to say about most chrysler products shadow for one always were they moaning about the reguritated k car and engine whereas motor trend always thought they were great cars no car magazine is really objective and although there are alot of people who don t like consumers reports i will use them to reinforce my argument i already know about the big stink with the saturn crash tests time will tell how good a car they are the shadow sundance rate much worse than average in fact none of the chrysler s rate a better than average i think the best one is just average excluding the diamond star mitsubishi stuff and the lh s you can find bad stuff about the shadow try as i might when i researched the saturn i could not find anything bad about it there is a great deal of information about this company just because it is a new american company and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community for good reason much more than the introduction of any new model lines of any established company i read an article which had a sub column an i think this imprinted on me more than anything else some big wig in toyota said and i quote we are watching them very closely come on everybody grow up the foreign cars especially the japanese have been kicking our butts for good reason the american car companies could not make a good product or support the customer the way they want these days to set in their ways which is one of the reasons saturn was created they are still struggling because they haven t learned yet they have the ability the workers are not inferior the technology is not out of date but their attitude is and they are just finding this out it s called competition gentleman women if you don t satisfy the demand of the consumer well your out asbestos suit on gaia
buick heater controls i have a buick skylark with k on it i bought it in california and if it ll let me i d like to keep it for another year the only problem is these indiana winters my heater controls don t work the car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents right now it is stuck in the vent mode it will blow warm air but i can t switch the air flow to either the floor i can live without this or the defrost i can t live without this i probably could just jam the air deflector to the defrost position but this blows a lot of air in my face and is well kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse i have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and i think the problem or part of it is with the two diaphragms which control up down and outside inside air flow the diaphragm which controls outside vent in side no vent air is cracked most of the way around and the other one is probably damaged too considering the advanced age of the car two questions is there anything i should be aware of about this other than the fact that i should move from indiana in the event that replacement diaphragms aren t available is there a way to fix this thanks for any advice info selah dan lovall physics purdue edu

re plymouth sundance dodge shadow experiences in article bd bdc news service uci edu raman translab its uci edu balaji v ramanathan writes the part about spending on repairs reminds me of an article i read in a magazine comparing the year ownership costs of a toyota camry and a ford taurus or something like that the result which they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at the end of the period that was their argument to prove that you don t go wrong buying the ford taurus over the camry now if i remember correctly the camry costs about or so more in initial costs essentially it means that you spend about extra on repairs on the taurus that is ridiculous every time your car needs repairs it is extra hassles loss of time and a dozen other things i would much rather spend more in initial costs than spend more in repair costs did you account for depreciation i seriously doubt that a taurus would rack up an extra in repair costs over years teddy

faq what is the dod this is a periodic posting intended to answer the frequently asked question what is the dod it is posted the first of each month with an expiration time of over a month thus unless your site s news software is ill mannered this posting should always be available this witdodfaq is crossposted to all four rec motorcycles groups in an attempt to catch most new users and followups are directed to rec motorcycles last changed feb to add a message from the kotl and a bit of halon version this collection was originally assembled by lissa shoun from the original postings with lissa

get a dod number if the most frequently asked question in rec motorcycles is what is the dod then the second most frequently asked question must be how do i get a dod number that is as simple as asking the keeper of the list kotl accept no substitue keepers for a number if you re feeling creative and your favorite number hasn t been taken already you can make a request subject to kotl approval warning non numeric non base number requests are likely to earn a flame from the kotl not that you won t get it but you will pay for it oh and just one little tiny suggestion ask the kotl in e mail you ll just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole net and you ll look like a clueless newbie too by now you re probably asking so who s the kotl already well as john sloan notes below that s about the only real secret left around here but a few un subtle hints can be divulged first it is not myself nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting maybe though john was the original kotl second in keeping with the true spirit of unix the kotl s first name is only two letters long and can be spelled entirely with hexadecimal characters the kotl shares his name with a line oriented text utility third he has occasionally been seen posting messages bestowing new dod numbers mostly to boneheads with weenie mailers fourth there is reason to suspect the kotl of being a dead head newsflash a message from the kotl once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically groveled to the kotl please keep in mind that the kotl does indeed work for a living and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting something done your request may languish in mailer queue for gasp days perhaps even horrors a week or two during such times of economic activity on the part of the kotl s employers sending yet another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue it just makes it longer verification of this phenominon is left as an excersize for the reader if you suspect mailer problems at least annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request was submitted lest you be assigned multiple numbers what you think the kotl memorizes the list one more thing the kotl says that its telepathic powers aren t what they used to be so provide some information for the list will ya the typical dod list entry contains number name state country e mail address for example ed green ca ed green east sun com ps while john mentions below that net access and a bike are the only requirements for dod membership that s not strictly true these days as there are a number of denizens who lack one or both blaine dances with bikers gardner blgardne javelin sim es com denizens of doom by bruce tanner dod road rider august reprinted with bruce s permission there is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal things that a bunch of bikers do they discuss motorcycles and motorcycling beverages cleaning fluids baklavah balaclava caltrops helmets anti fog shields spine protectors aerodynamics three angle valve seats bird hits deer whistles good restaurants racing philosophy traffic laws tickets corrosion control personalities puns double entendres culture absence of culture first rides and friendship they argue with each other and plan rides together the difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that although they get together just about everyday most have never seen each other face to face the members of this group live all over the known world and communicate with each other electronically via computer the computers range from laptops to multi million dollar computer centers the people range from college and university students to high tech industry professionals to public access electronic bulletin board users currently rec motorcycles pronounced wreck dot motorcycles it s the file name for the group s primary on line meeting place carries about articles per month it is read by an estimated people most of the frequent posters belong to a motorcycle club the denizens of doom usually referred to as the dod the dod started when motorcyclist john r nickerson wrote a couple of parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes fellow computer enthusiast bruce robinson posted these articles under the pen name denizen of doom a while later chuck rogers signed off as dod nr keeper of the flame bruce was then designated dod nr retroactively and of course nickerson the originator of the parodies was given dod nr the idea of a motorcycle club with no organization no meetings and no rules appealed to many so john sloan dod nr became keeper of the list issuing dod numbers to anyone who wanted one to date there have been almost memberships issued to people all over the united states and canada as well as australia new zealand the united kingdom france germany norway and finland keeper of the list sloan eventually designed a club patch the initial run of patches sold out immediately the profits from this went to the american motorcycle heritage foundation another amhf fund raiser selling denizens of doom pins to members was started by arnie skurow a few months later again the project was successful and the profits were donated to the foundation so far the denizens have contributed over to the ama museum a plaque in the name of the denizens of doom now hangs in the motorcycle heritage museum as often as possible the dod ers crawl out from behind their crts and go riding together it turns out that the two largest concentrations of dod ers are centered near denver boulder colorado and in california s silicon valley consequently two major events are the annual assault on rollins pass in colorado and the northern versus southern california joust the ride and feed is a bike trip over rollins pass followed by a big barbecue dinner the concept for the joust is to have riders from northern california ride south riders from southern california to ride north meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle an additional plan for is to hold an official denizens of doom homecoming in conjunction with the ama heritage homecoming in columbus ohio in july though it s a safe bet the the denizens of doom and their collective communications hub rec motorcycles will not replace the more traditional motorcycle organizations for those who prowl the electronic pathways in search of two wheeled camaraderie it s a great way for kindred spirits to get together long may they flame live to flame flame to live centerbar this official motto of the denizens of doom refers to the ease with which you can gratuitously insult someone electronically when you would not do anything like that face to face these insults are known as flames issuing them is called flaming flames often start when a member disagrees with something another member has posted over the network a typical sophisticated intelligent form of calm reasoned rebuttal would be something like what an incredibly stupid statement you spandex clad poseur this will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense of the original poster describing just what they think of you your riding ability and your cat the denizens of doom the saga unfolds by john sloan dod periodically the question what is dod is raised this is one of those questions in the same class as why is the sky blue if there is a god why is there so much suffering in the world and why do women inevitably tell you that you re such a nice guy just before they dump you the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism tradition and philosophy questions that have inspired research and discussion by philosophers in locker rooms motorcycle service bays and in the halls of academe for generations a long long time ago in computer time where anything over a few minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem on a computer far far away on the net topologically speaking two machines in the same room in atlanta might route mail to one another via a system in chicago a chap who wished to remain anonymous but who was eventually assigned the dod membership wrote a satire of the various personalities and flame wars of rec motorcycles and signed it the denizen of doom not wishing to identify himself he asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time become dod to post it for him dod not really giving a whit about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking individual did so flaming and other amusements followed he who would become the holder of dod membership thought this was the funniest thing he d seen in a while being the sort that is pretty easily amused so he claimed membership in the denizens of doom motorcycle club and started signing his postings with his membership number perhaps readers of rec motorcycles were struck with the vision of a motorcycle club with no dues no rules no restrictions as to brand or make or model or national origin of motorcycle a club organized electronically it may well be that readers were yearning to become a part of something that would provide them with a greater identity a gestalt personality something in which the whole was greater than the sum of its parts it could also be that we re all computer nerds who wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors who just happen to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight ratios social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open minded enough to accept us as members in a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy the denizens of doom motorcycle club was born a club in which the majority of members have never met one another face to face and perhaps like it that way yet feel that they know one another pretty well or well enough given some of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup a club organized and run in the loosest sense of the word by volunteers through the network via electronic news and mail with a membership mailing list often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the same region a motto a logo a series of photo albums circulating around the country organized by dod club patches organized by and even an mtv style music video produced by and distributed on vhs by where will it end who knows will the dod start sanctioning races placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on board engine management computers will the dod organize poker runs where each participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards will the dod have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal room and at least a sized unix system only time will tell the dod has no dues no rules and no requirements other than net access and a love for motorcycles to become a member one need only ask although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few really good club secrets new members will receive via email a membership number and the latest copy of the membership list which includes name state and email address the denizens of doom motorcycle club will live forever or at least until next year

who had watched the movie top gun a few times too many rose to the occasion and replied that s classified we could tell you but then we d have to kill you and the rest is history a variation on the

debasers of daughters dickweeds of denver driveway of death debauchers of donuts dumpers of dirtbikes note that this is not a comprehensive list as variations appear to be limited only by the contents of one s imagination or dictionary file the rec moto photo archive first a bit of history this all started with ilana stern and chuck rogers organizing a rec motorcycles photo album many copies were made and several sets were sent on tours around the world only to vanish in unknown locations then bruce tanner decided that it would be appropriate for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album bruce has not only provided the disk space and ftp e mail access but he has taken the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive not only can you see what all these folks look like you can also gawk at their motorcycles a few non photo files are available from the server too they include the dod membership list the dod yellow pages the general rec motorcycles faq and this faq posting here are a couple of excerpts from from messages bruce posted about how to use the archive via ftp cerritos edu via e mail the address is server cerritos edu the commands are given in the body of the message the current commands are dir and send given one per line the arguments to the commands are vms style file specifications for rec moto photo the file spec is dod file for example you can send dir dod send dod bruce tanner gif send dod dodframe ps and you ll get back mail messages a directory listing uuencoded parts of bruce tanner gif and the dodframe ps file in ascii oh wildcards are allowed but a maximum of mail messages rounded up to the next whole file are send a send dod gif would send files of k each not a good idea bruce tanner x tanner cerritos edu cerritos college norwalk ca cerritos tanner a couple of comments bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this so why not drop him a note if you find the rec moto photo archive useful second since bruce has provided the server as a favor it would be kind of you to access it after normal working hours california time patches what patches you may have heard mention of various dod trinkets such as patches pins and your reaction was probably i want or that s sick or perhaps that s sick i want well there s some good news and some bad news the good news is that there s been an amazing variety of dod labeled widgets created the bad news is that there isn t anywhere you can buy any of them this isn t because of any exclusivity attempt but simply because there is no dod store that keeps a stock all of the creations have been done by individual denizens out of their own pockets the typical procedure is someone says i m thinking of having a dod frammitz made they ll cost xx xx with xx xx going to the ama museum anyone want one then orders are taken and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the pre paid orders is produced and quickly consumed so if you want a dod doodad act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one or produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling after all this is anarchy in action here s a possibly incomplete list of known dod merchandise and perpetrators patches dod pins dod stickers dod motorcycle license plate frames dod t shirts dod polo shirts dod zippo lighters dod ltf ftl belt buckles dod and patches dod a second batch was done and rapidly consumed by popular demand all profits have been donated to the american motorcyclist association motorcycle heritage museum as of june over dollars has been contributed to

re its still cold but one thing is certain though its still too cold after about minutes i had to stop and hold my muffler for a while be very careful about this if youre really cold the muffler will feel fine till you leave all the charred skin on it when you peel your hands off i speak from experience you can also do all kindsa americanism of the day damage to your circulation warming hands up on something too hot by far the best fastest and safest way to do it is to shove the hands up the opposit sleeves and stand there like a ming emporer for a while five minutes should do it
re its still cold but first ride of the season one thing is certain though its still too cold after about minutes i had to stop and hold my muffler for a while when i got home after a few hours i kept all my gear on for about a half hour in the house f humidity no wind protection and mph do not mix well hell this is warm i retired my fleece from under the aerostich last month when the temperature got aboce try living a couple of years on the dole so you cant afford any heating you put the gear on in october abd you take it off again in may getting out on the bike seems like a luxury in comparison cos oyur usuallu going somewhere warm its all relative happy cold riding who are you trying to kid its the pain that makes it all worthwhile
re freezing and riding every spec of alertness to keep from getting squished otherwise it s not only dangerous it s unpleasant the same goes for cold and fatigue as i once took a half hour nap at a gas station to insure that i would make it yeah hypothermia is much more detrimemtal to your judgement and reactions than people realise i wish i had the patience to stop when i should one day i ll pay for it if you begin to shiver stop and warm up thoroughly if you leave it till the shivering stops this doesnt mean you re ok again it means you re a danger to yourself and everyone else on the road your brain and body are working about as fast as a tree grows you will not realise this yourself till you hit something the next stage is passing out this usually means falling off

riding jacket recommendations my old jacket is about to bite the dust so i m in the market for a new riding jacket i m looking for recommendations for a suitable replacement i would like to buy a full aerostich suit but i can t afford for it right now i m considering two basic options buy the aerostich jacket only dunno how much it costs due to recent price increases but i d imagine over that may be pushing my limit advantages include the fact that i can later add the pants and that it nearly eliminates the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit buy some kind of leather jacket i like a few of the new hein gericke firstgear line however they may be a bit pricey unless i can work some sort of deal advantages of leather are potentially slightly better protection enhanced pose value we all know how important that is possibly cheaper than upper aerostich requirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other layers mainly a sizing thing if leather i d prefer a zip out lining it must have some body armor similar to aerostich elbows shoulders forearms possibly back kidney protection etc a reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice ventilation would be a plus however it must be wearable in cold weather below freezing with layers or perhaps electrics please fire away with suggestions comments etc steve steve andersen dod andersen me udel edu andersen zr ccm udel edu ducati i e yamaha srx life is simply a consequence of the complexities of carbon chemistry

crappy honda cx hi i just have a small question about my bike being a fairly experienced bmw and mz mechanic i just don t know what to think about my honda she was using too much oil for the last km on my trip to daytona bike week this spring and all of a sudden she trailed smoke like hell and was running only on one cylinder i towed the bike home and took it apart but everything looks in perfect working order no cracks in the heads or pistons the cylinder walls look very clean and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable all still within factory specs the only thing i could find however was a slightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder the one with the problem but it is still way below the wear limit given in the clymer manual for this bike any syggestions what else could cause my problem do i have to hone the cylinder walls make them a little rougher in a criss cross pattern in order to get better breaking in of my new rings won t that increase the wear of my pistons please send comments to sruhl mechanical watstar uwaterloo ca thanks in advance stef stefan ruhl german exchange student don t poke into my privacy

thanks for the speeding ticket advice i d like to thank everyone who took the time to respond to my post about fighting my ticket many of you wrote to say that you have successfully fought and won your case in court others lost due to the cop outright lying to the judge about the circumstances surrounding your ticket while one fellow lost because the judge just didn t appear to be in the mood for such foolishness several of you suggested that i obtain a book called fight your ticket the general theme from those who said go for it was to be prepared i should do as much research as possible go back and review the scene transcribe what happened to tape or paper use any witnesses that may have been around have a list of questions to ask the cop and or the judge and to be positive and assertive i am innocent until proven guilty gulp a few people suggested trying to get my court date changed as this might trip up the arresting officer he may not show up if the date is on his day off or if he feels knows that he doesn t have a chance to win against you one individual stated that an officer could be an expert witness and if he says i was speeding then by damn i was speeding another says that i must have been paced or clocked with a radar gun lots of good suggestions and ideas from you all i ll let you know what happens after the big day peter d nesbitt air traffic controller pnesbitt mcimail com oakland bay tracon

airhorns on an fj review for those of you who are thinking about fiamms you might also want to think about airhorns i just installed a set of bosch air horns ordered from dennis kirk pg of the latest catalog on my fj they are rated at db at meters i installed them using gage wire from the battery to the relay to the compressor to ground my stock horn connectors fit the relay pins just fine i soldered the connections to the relay and compressor and used a crimp type battery connector and an inline amp fuse connector from napa i installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube frame used to support the front fairing you have to remove the front fairing to do this but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two vertical supports just in front of the fuses depending how tight your fairing follows the frame you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing the compressor is about in diameter and about long the relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame it is small so there should be plenty of good places for it i found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to mount the horns fit inside the front fairing frame and stick out on either side just in front of the air scoops but behind the turn signals the back of the horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame there is just enough room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance and there are nice cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into the short horn is even with the fairing and the long one sticks out about an inch or so but it is really not that noticable unless you look closely they end up pointing down slightly and maybe degrees from straight ahead perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you if you have any other questions about the mounting email and i can try to explain better if your bike is not red then you may want to paint them first how do they work you ask they are very very very loud they sound more like a european sports car than a truck but a vast improvement over stock i have used them at least daily since installing them and the amp fuse has not blown yet although the duration of the horn blasts have been short i ve repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them even though they know that i have the horns they still jump they are perfect for keeping the pedestrians on the sidewalk the bottom line is they work are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to those stupid lane changing cages as well as take a few years off their lives and are relatively easy to install on the fj ymmv tjk fj with get out of my way horns that looks like a suit you d fight a fire in comment about the aerostich

dogs i m a biker and a dog lover first and foremost i want to mention some common sense if it s a choice between injuring killing a dog or getting yourself injured killed there is only one rational decision only the most insane animal rights kook would put the dog first second it s useful to learn how to read a dog s body language how you react to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it s a game and that you re playing with him is completely different from how you react to a dog which has hostile intent third it s useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog dogs are social beasts and recognize a domination submission hierarchy to a dog there are two types of fellow creatures that which he dominates and that which dominate him you need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the latter class you are god you are easily angered and your anger is terrible but god is also amused by one who properly submits to his dominance and may even on rare occasions dispense a kind word a kind word or even oh joy oh rapture unforeseen a dog bisquit now how does that all relate to biking well first it s a good idea to assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it s a game and not out of overt hostility the msf suggestion is a very good one when you see the dog coming slow down so he determines a particular place of interception just before you and he reach that spot punch the throttle so that when he reaches it you re already long gone dogs take a few seconds to react to new input and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a motorcycle is capable of with a hostile dog or one which you repeatedly encounter stronger measures may be necessary this is the face off first and there is very important make sure you never face off a dog on his territory face him off on the road not on his driveway if necessary have a large stick rolled up newspaper etc something the beast will understand is something that will hurt him stand your ground then slowly advance your mental attitude is that you are very angry and are going to dispense terrible punishment the larger the dog the greater your anger dogs will pick up anger just as they can pick up fear and since you and he are not on his home territory it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he is on your territory and that you are prepared to fight to the death most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory where there is at least a home advantage they ll also observe that you are satisfied by that retreat gesture of submission and thus they have escaped punishment the interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great deal to them the more effective you are at communicating body language the less you actually have to do after years with my pound beast i ve learned a few tricks i think

re countersteering faq please post in article mjs zen sys uea ac uk mjs sys uea ac uk mike sixsmith writes formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you re going to be able to ride a bike properly and safely but by including countersteering theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily right at the time when there are far more important matters for them to learn and that was my original point mike while i agree with you on that formal training is essential for safe riding i disagree strongly with your original point the point of formal training must be to prepare riders for the road preparedness is in my opinion to know as much as possible so to exclude some aspects of riding a bike in a course is wrong imho now to countersteering in particular countersteering is something that must be trained a common reaction among new bikers or bicycle riders in an emergency situation is to steer the motorcycle like a bicycle as we know this makes the motorcycle go in the direction opposite to what was intended needless to say this is dangerous i have a specific example a rider in a left turn the rider thinks he she is to close to the right shoulder of the road and tries to steer the motorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right handle the motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road a worse scenario the same rider same turn in the middle of the turn the rider sees a truck coming towards him her the panicking rider tries to steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it the main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency situations and what to do if in one thus the knowledge and training of countersteering is imho a must in any riding course staal idt unit no

re countersteering faq please post in article apr cs cornell edu karr cs cornell edu david karr writes in article mjs zen sys uea ac uk mjs sys uea ac uk mike sixsmith writes no no no no all i am saying is that you don t even need to tell people the technique of countersteering cos they will do it intuitively the first time they try to go round a corner some will and others will steer with their tuchuses i don t know how much the teaching of countersteering in the beginner course really helps the tuchus steerers i was one i guess that i always steered a bicycle that way and i only got the hang of countersteering in normal riding after the course i could do the countersteering swerves in the course no problem but i only started using it in my normal riding when i decided that my turning at speed off ramps and the like was a lot more difficult that it should have been i knew how it works although that s currently up for debate definitely knew that it works as i could do it in swerves but only figured it out later in my normal riding just a data point i think that it s not a bad idea to bring the idea up but it s best to let everyone tuchus steer for the first lesson or two so they can learn to shift gears before they have to worry about proper handlebar technique countersteering in fact my experienced rider course instructors claimed that they could get on behind a new rider and make the bike turn to whichever side they wanted just by shifting their weight around even when the operator was trying to turn in the opposite direction i admit i ve never actually seen this i have in our beginner course we had passenger training sometime during the lesson the instructor would hop on the back of the bike and the student would take him for a ride if the student did not give the instructor the you are a sack of potatoes passenger speech the instructor would steer the bike and make a general nuisance of himself it was amusing to watch i m just happy that it didn t happen to me i ve bike like jody levine dod kv got a you can if you pf jody p levine hydro on ca ride it toronto ontario canada

spagthorpe viking ds from viking iastate edu dan sorenson ds ryan cousineau compdyn questor org ryan cousineau writes ds riding up the hill leading to my ds house i encountered a liver and white springer spaniel no relation to ds the springer softail or the springer spagthorpe a close relation to ds the spagthorpe viking ds i must have missed the article on the spagthorpe viking was ds that the one with the little illuminated dragon s head on the front ds fender a style later copied by indian and the round side covers no not at all the viking was a trick little unit made way back when forties fifties when spag was trying to make a go of it in racing the first iteration the springer was a boxer twin very similar to max friz s famous design but with an overhead point cam see below for more on the valvetrain the problem was that the thing had no ground clearance whatsoever the solution was to curve the cylinder bores so that the ground clearance was substantially increased springer motor front viking motor front this is roughly the idea except that the bores were gradually curved around a radius as the pistons were loath to make a sharp angled turn in the middle of their stroke the engine also had curved connecting rods to accomodate the stroke the engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary and still unique overhead cam system through the use of clever valve timing and and extrordinarily trick valve linkage only a single cam lobe was required to drive both overhead valves just as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation which used a pressurized stream of oil to power the waterwheel which kept the lobe spinning over one side effect that required some rather brutal engineering fixes was that until the engine s oil pressure came up to normal the engine s valve timing would be more or less random resulting in some impressive start up valve damage the solution was a little hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the beast remarkably similar to the system used in new porsches to pressurize the oil system before the car is started the cage however uses an electric oil pump wimps despite this fix the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively firing its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily lose a bit of oil pressure in a corner the solution was to run even higher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly this was feasible because it was a racing engine with just a single overhead lobe and no pushrod shaft chain towers because of the hydraulic system the head of the engine came to an almost perfect point lobe xx complex linkage not shown due to valvestems complexity piston note that the tip was not truly vertical it was at about a degree angle to the ground and this drawing doesn t show the curvature because there was none in the head itself the bore curve would start about where the cylinder bore disappears in this diagram the effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently pundits of the day even said sensuously curved cylinders was much like a pair of finned viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank thus the name the vik was a moderately successful racer lightning fast when it worked but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary technology eventually it was dumped when spag finally realized that racing was not where the spagthorpe name would be made the machines were raced for another year or two by privateers and their fate approximately six vikings were made plus one or possibly two springers confusing the issue is one old spag staffer who swears up and down that this machine was tooled for production and that as many as twenty or thirty machines may have come off the line however no modern record of a production viking has survived and most motorcycle historians discount this story ryan cousinetc yamaha vision xz black pig of inverness live to ride kotrb ajs c s king rat to work to dod i d be a squid if i could afford the bike flame to ryan cousineau compdyn questor org vancouver bc canada live slmr a if you aren t sliding you aren t riding computer dynamics bbs hst v vancouver bc canada easy access low rates friendly sysop

st ride sixteen days i had put off test driving the honda st finally the th was a saturday without much rain in fact it cleared up became warm and sunny and the wind died about three weeks ago i took a long cool ride on the hawk down to cycles for a test ride they had sold and delivered the demo st about fifteen hours before i arrived and the demo vfr was bike locked in the showroom surrounded by other bikes and not likely to move soon today was different there were even more bikes used dirt bikes used street bikes cars and a big tent full of outlandishly fat touring bikes with trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot some sort of fat bike convention shelly and dave were running one msf course each at the same time one in the classroom and one on the back lot plus there was the usuall free cookout food that cycles gives away every weekend in the summer hmmm it seemed like a big moto party after about ten minutes of looking for rob c cheif of sales slime and another minutes reading and signing a long disclosure libility pray to god form i helped jt push the st out into the mess in the parking lot we went over the the controls i put the tank bag from the hawk into the right saddlebag and my wife put everything else into the left saddlebag thats nice having helped push the st out to the lot i thought it best to have jt move it to the edge of the road away from the bikes and people he rode it like a bicycle it cant be that heavy i thought well i was wrong as i sat on the st both feet down all i could think was big then i put one foot up heavy came to mind very quickly with cindy on the back was she on the back hard to tell with seat three times as large as a hawk seat the bike seemed nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road by rpm in second gear all the weight seemed to dissappear even on bike with miles on the odometer slippery new tires and pads that did not yet bite the disks things seems smooth and sure cycles is on a section of that few folks ever ride about miles north of the computer concentration about five miles north of where i splits away is a lighly travelled two lane limited access highway it goes through heavily forested sections of hamilton manchester by the sea and newbury on its way to gloucester on its way there it meets a road that winds from the sea about miles inland to andover on its way it goes through many thoroughly new england spots perfect if slow sport touring sections cindy has no difficulty with speed rd gear th gear purring along in top gear this thing has less low rpm grunt that my hawk lane changes were a new experience a big heft is required to move this thing responds well though no wallowing or complaint behind the fairing it was fairly quiet but the helmet buffeting was non trivial top gear car passing at mph was nearly effortless smooth smooth smooth not sure what the v sound reminds me of but it is pleasant if only the bars were not transmitting an endless buzz the jump on to caused me to be less than impressed with the brakes its a down hill reversing camber twice reversing radius decreasing radius turn a real squeeze is needed on the front binder the section of we were on was tight but too urban the st works ok in this section but it shows its weight we went by the clam shack oft featured in spencer for hire a place where you could really find spencer his house was about miles down after putting through traffic for a while we turned and went back to about half way through the onramp i yanked cindy s wrist our singal for hold on tight head check left time to find redline second gear gives a good shove third too fourth sees dod speed with a short shift into top on the way to we saw no cops and very light traffic did not cross into dod zone because the bike was too new well now it had miles on it so it was ok tried some high effort lane changes some wide sweeping turns time to wick it up i went until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat and stayed there when i was comfortable with the wind and the steering i looked down to find an indicated mph not bad for up touring beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit at the get off in a mile sign i rolled off the throttle and coasted i wanted to re adjust to the coming slowness it was a good idea there were several manhole sized patches of sand on the exit ramp back to the slow and heavy behavior cycles is about a mile from i could see even more cars stacked up outside right when i got off i managed to thread the st through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad out front heavy it took way too much effort for cindy and i to put the thing on the center stand i am sure that if i used the side stand the st would have been on its side within a minute my demo opinion heavy

re changing sprocket ratios honda cb in article c k bm btb ms uky edu cbrooks ms uky edu clayton brooks writes do any honda gurus know if i can replace the the front sprocket on my honda cb k with a slightly larger one i see this as being preferable to reducing the size of the rear one that s a twin cam right there s a steel guard right next to the sprocket to keep a broken chain from punching a hole in the engine cases and it s needed there s probably not enough room to fit a bigger sprocket i d be inclined to take two teeth off the rear for a ratio change rather than adding one to the front for about if you raise the overall gear ratio too much you ll impair the bike s rideability because the gears will be far enough apart that there will be only one gear that provides adequate response at any given speed honda s don t have the widest of power bands chuck karish karish mindcraft com x karish pangea stanford edu

re how to act in front of traffic jerks in article nielsmm nanna imv aau dk nielsmm imv aau dk niels mikkel michelsen writes the other day it was raining cats and dogs therefor i was going only to the speed limit on nothing more on my bike this guy in his bmw was driving meters behind me for meters and at the next red light i calmly put the bike on its leg walked back to this car he rolled down the window and i told him he was a total idiot and the reason why did i do the right thing well i used to get mad and either try to communicate my anger to jerks or to uhm educate them in how to improve their manners in traffic now i just try to get them off my tail in heavy traffic i slow down a bit mostly so i have more buffer zone in front to balance the minimal buffer behind but i also often find that the jerk behind will notice traffic moving faster in other lanes switch into one of them and pass me which is fine because then i can keep a better eye on the jerk from behind while looking ahead rather than from in front while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirrors in traffic so heavy that there is no way for the jerk to pass i might pull over as if to look for a street number or name still ignoring the jerk just to get the jerk off my tail if this all sounds well wimpy or un denizenly or pessimistic or perhaps for any psych types passive aggressive consider that i prefer to get my adrenaline jollies from riding rather than from yelling at jerks a ride can improve my whole day while yelling at a jerk is likely for me to ruin my ride or my day with my own anger in the worst case yelling at the jerk could ruin my life since even a tiny jerk in a cage behind me is better armed with the cage than i am on a bike on the other hand you might try subtly arranging to be the last vehicle to legally cross one or more intersections leaving the jerk waiting for cross traffic and thus off your tail or crossing illegally hopefully in front of the waiting police like almost everything here your choices and mileage will vary denis mckeon galway chtm eece unm edu

boom dog attack my previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or something i ve weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method slow down to screw up dog s triangulation of target then take off and laugh at the dog now far behind you this time it didn t work because i didn t have time riding up the hill leading to my house i encountered a liver and white springer spaniel no relation to the springer softail or the springer spagthorpe a close relation to the spagthorpe viking actually the dog encountered me with intent to harm but i digress i was riding near the unpainted centerline of the roughly foot wide road doing between forty and sixty clicks mph for the velocity impaired the dog shot at me from behind bushes on the left side of the road at an impossibly high speed i later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch about thirty feet away heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road i saw the dog and before you could say sipde he was on me boom i took the dog in the left leg and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike and cracking one panel i think i saw the dog spin around when i looked back but my memory of this moment is hazy i next turned around and picked the most likely looking house the apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt cut mouth and hoped i was not hurt either i could feel the pain in my shin and expected a cool purple welt to form soon sadly it has not so i m left with a tender shin and no cool battle scars interestingly the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off course the not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some gut reaction to the sudden impact delayed pain may have helped me here as i didn t feel a sudden sharp pain that i can remember what worries me about the accident is this i don t think i could have prevented it except by traveling much slower than i was this is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area but i was riding around the speed limit i worry about what would have happened if it had been a car instead of a dog but i console myself with the thought that it would take a truly insane bdi cager to whip out of a blind driveway at mph for that matter how many driveways are long enough for a car to hit mph by the end i eagerly await comment ryan cousinetc yamaha vision xz black pig of inverness live to ride kotrb ajs c s king rat to work to dod i d be a squid if i could afford the bike flame to ryan cousineau compdyn questor org vancouver bc canada live slmr a he s hurt dammit jim i m a doctor oh right computer dynamics bbs hst v vancouver bc canada easy access low rates friendly sysop

guzzi t tires plus fairing question i have a question about tires for my guzzi it is a t the tires that were on it when i just bought it are old and cracked i do not have an owners manual for it yet but the tires listed in the haynes manual are front h rear h and pressures recommended are front and rear oddly the pressure for the same tire on the t is listed at psi instead anyone know the reason as i know though the pressure i should run at is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires i purchase the real question i have is this the old tires that are on the bike are for the front a metzler touring special h and for the rear an avon roadrunner h h as marked on each tire both are larger than that listed in the haynes manual what does the owners manual recommend and was it common to go up one size for this bike also this will be my first motorcycle with innertubes any comments on the various manufacturers inner tube qualities the above sizes are inches except for the additional mark on the current rear tire what is the best metric match the local bmw dealer thought h on the front and h on the back he also happens to be very good at getting close to matching mail order prices i am thinking of going with a metzler me laser possibly comp k on the front and me on the back both in mbs variety if possible the longer lasting belting system i already use the me on both the vision and fj for the front and like it and i thought that with the shaft drive behavior and torque from the guzzi that the me might give more predictable back end control and sliding behavior than a me might as well as giving much better tire milage life any comments a friend told me he thought that my bike had boranni rims which are very good but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls i do not wish to mount the tires myself this first time so aside from warning the shop to be careful any other comments i should make i havn t looked at the rim to check out the make yet if it is marked he just told me late yesterday and i havn t had a chance to check the rim type on another note i will remove the ugly but in good shape anyone want it vetter fairing and i will run without a windscreen for a while but eventually i would like a simple rounded cafe style quarter fairing for it it could be fork handlebar mounted any suggestions is there such a thing as a frame mounted quarter fairing of the cafe style for this bike how about lower bars clip ons for it i would like to restore the bike into a good condition runner with a few modern updates but while not being historically exactly accurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe style yes i know to be picky that period really predates this bike it is just that this bike has such potential for that look edward walsh hewlett packard company edw boi hp com disk memory division ms p o box boise idaho fj xz rj vision guzzi t dod edward walsh hewlett packard company edw boi hp com disk memory division ms p o box boise idaho fj xz rj vision guzzi t dod

re eck vs rickey was re rickey s whining again in article blue cis pitt edu genetic pitt edu david m tate writes i ve read all of the followups to this but i thought i d go back to the original article to make specific comments about the method jao megatest com john oswalt said he has obtained the play by play records in computer readable form for every major league baseball game for the past several years he devised an algorithm which i call sum over situations and wrote a computer program to calculate every major league players contribution using it it works like this look at every situation in every game in a baseball season a situation is determined by inning score where the baserunners are and how many outs there are for each situation count how many times the team eventually won the game that the situation occured in and divide by the number of times the situation came up to come up with a value for that situation this was first done by george lindsey in the late s early s and reported in article an investigation of strategies in baseball author george r lindsey journal operations research issue volume july august pp later pete palmer did the same thing using simulated seasons to generate a larger set of data to avoid the kind of small sample anomalies that other people have worried about he reported this in the hidden game of baseball with john thorn gary skoog modified the method a bit and did some work on what he called a value added measure based on these situational values his were based directly on marginal runs though not on win probabilities these results as applied to the season were reported in one of the bill james baseball abstract books help me out here somebody for example a situation might be inning score runner on second and no outs there were regular season major league games last year with the rockies and marlins there will be more this year say this situation came up in of those and the team ahead won of them then the value of this situation is description of method look at change in win probability based on the at bat plus any baserunning and credit debit the player by that amount each time he gets a plate appearance now for each player sum up all his at bat and base running values for the season to obtain an overall value for that player obviously the sum of all players values for each game and for the season as a whole will be that s only because you always credit x to the batter and x to the pitcher there s no validation involved ok there s a very big problem here that nobody has yet commented on you re adding probabilities and probabilities don t add runs you can add the total team runs breaks down into how many runs joe contributed plus how many runs fred contributed etc but probabilities don t work that way if bob increases his team s chance of winning by in each of pas that does not mean that bob increased his team s chance of winning by in fact it doesn t mean anything because the units are screwy i agree and disagree john is saying that the batters efforts will result in more wins then losses while you are probably correct that does not mean more wins then losses it means something i would rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by in each of pas then i would a player who increased my chances of winning by in each of pas thus there appears to me to be an obvious positive association between john s statistic and winning games thus before you disregard this stat it appears to me that further study must go into what sort of relationship there is consider an example bob hits a out solo hr in the bottom of the first about on your scale he does the same thing again in the fourth with the score tied for another and again in the seventh with the score tied for another and finally in the ninth to win the game by a score of for a value of bob hit solo hr in plate appearances and was credited by your method with but what does that mean was bob responsible for the win certainly not the defense is always responsible if you include pitching in that and bob wasn t pitching in fact bob was only of the offense which is a lot but not even close to furthermore what about the other team runs say they all came on solo hr by fred then fred was hitting hr to tie up the game which are just as valuable as hr to take the lead see lindsey and fred will himself have accrued a good rating or so so fred and bob combined have amassed of a win in one game there s clearly a problem here the only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly how many wins the team has first we are using averages over many seasons and applying them to one game second remember some players performance take away from the chance of you winning that is a player who gets an out gets a negative probability in most cases thus i m not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers for a team who won that they will add up to in that game sometimes they will add up to more then one sometime less than one also the pitchers bad performances giving up runs may have given them a large negative percentage for that game also any batter that pulled an night would give large negatives greg thinking about the right things but his intuition is off the mark closers are enormously important the total number of runs value is outweighed by when they come or are prevented from comming the doubling which greg allows is not enough in another article i proposed a test of this we can predict a team s won lost record quite accurately by looking at how many runs total they score and allow without regard to when those runs score in the game if late runs are really more important than early runs then looking only at late runs should lead to a better predictor right no but really only because you have a smaller sample size i would think however that the number of runs you score in the first inning would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score in the last inning and realize something else a closer usually comes in in a close situation not a blow out it is hard to argue that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance to those given up in the first inning look a closer giving up runs often means a team will lose many games on the other hand a starter who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win the offence has many more outs to do something about but i am not saying all late inning situations are equally important either if i am down runs in the ninth it really does not matter how many runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth here s another thought experiment apply this method to basketball what you find is that points scored in the first half of the game have almost exactly no value because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play furthermore the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with no time on the clock gets a for the game while the star forward who scored points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets a zero does this make sense no but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would be before the possesion in which the free throws were made look if you are down point with seconds left there is a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the ball and do not forget that somebody elses missed shots turnovers fouls bad defense etc caused a negative chance that the team would win from reading all of the discussion on this statistic i feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda at first look this statistic valadates clutchness but it really does not cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance goes down i ve never seen convincing proof that this really happens so if you assume there is no clutchness then that means that except for a lot of noice this statistic has a positive association to player performance there is a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness certainly we could find out what the average value of a home run is for example we may find for instance that a home run increases your chance of winning by on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by i bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses how do we evaluate relief pitchers say john and sam have the exact same pitching statistics runs earned runs k s bb s etc both had exceptional numbers john however only pitched in closer situations while sam was a mop up man who was more valuble to their team probably john who was the better pitcher they were probably about the same brian smith

atas n l games standings of all philadelphia at chicago teams tied for st after sunday dick redding battled chet brewer in the first game of a dramatic four game series one friday one saturday and a good old sunday doubleheader what could be better declared ernie banks perhaps the fact that the cubs are challenging it s pitching it s always been pitching that we ve lacked announced ryne sandberg if we can get by brewer then beat carlton alexander or bunning preferrably of the last three we ll know we might be able to win lord i hope we pull it off the phils scored once in the top of the first richie ashburn singled pete rose followed with a hit sending ashburn around second kiki cuyler cut the ball off in left center and threw a bullet in to ernie banks who threw to ron santo to get ashburn at third rose went to second on the play christobel torrienti lifted a long fly to center moving pete rose to third schmidt was walked the cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them both torrienti and schmidt will likely draw walks this year chuck klein is starting to hit very well and he lashed a double into a gap in right center cool papa bell s speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent schmidt from scoring nellie fox was walked and bob boone grounded out to second ending the threat teams are starting to realize that you don t have to pitch to schmidt or torrienti and that is lowering their run total it puts a lot of pressure on klein and dick allen who platoons with chuck klein and occasionally spells rose at first and it s a credit to the phillies that they ve been able to sustain their pace the picthers have slumped at times so came the analysis from frank chance the cubs got that run back when bell bunted for a hit thomas grounder moved him to second and after sandberg made out billy williams singled home a run in the sixth ron santo launched a two run homer to make it dick redding got in trouble in the eighth as schmidt singled and klein singled him to third ed reulbach entered to face fox but dick allen popped out of the dugout to hit allen doubled to right but luckily for the cubs williams had moved to left and andre dawson had been inserted for defense he fired a bullet to home plate to keep klein at third lance parrish hitting for boone was walked and bruce sutter entered larry bowa grounded into a double play but ed delahanty walked as a pinch hitter desiring a strikeout since ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick trillo pinch running at third chance brought in lee smith who induced a pop up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder ending the inning the cubs took the win moving a game behind the phillies steve carlton was called upon to battle finger brown saturday to get another righthander in the lineup ron santo moved to first and bill madlock played third unfortunately brown allowed six doubles and the cub bullpen was worn down even more as the cubs tried to maintain a lead against lefty madlock batting sixth had knocked two doubles of his own driving home four runs gabby hartnett hit two home runs and cuyler added another and the score was cubs after six innings the phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth as the cubs grabbed more runs to ice an triumph sunday s twin bill saw cool papa bell gather seven straight hits at one point including a rare outside the park home run in the second game off robin roberts grover alexander of the phils took the first contest but the cubs captured the second one with waddell gaining the win bruce sutter tossed two innings for the save though he allowed one run in the eighth the cardinals stood half a game behind these co leaders and would conclude their series with the expos on monday montreal at st louis august way tie for st dennis martinez is on a roll and he continued it versus john tudor friday the expos have a wide variety of hitters and while they aren t among the all time greats they are getting the job done after winning their first first two games they suddenly found themselves only games out of first in this wacky season martinez triumphed on friday and williams outdueled dizzy dean saturday however the cardinals refused to give up winning on sunday the cards captured monday s game too as steve carlton outdueled steve rogers we re really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed remarked lou brock i don t see why we can t win this division the phillies and cubs may have some reasons for them two thirds of the way through the season there is a way tie for first new york at pittsburgh august straight wins for bucs now back but in th when your team is in a slump like we are the worst thing is to play in a pitcher s park like this spoke gil hodges before the series keith hernandez added that their defense takes away quite a few runs per year and it must be giving them an extra wins the pirates have made only errors all season ahead of the second place dodgers error totals tend to be around for the best defensive all time teams rube foster defeated sid fernandez friday and candelaria outshone seaver saturday in a game featuring some outstanding defense when nolan ryan and two relivers hit the mets in another win sunday the pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the mark they had been unable to several times in the past month bert blyleven met dwight gooden in the afternoon game both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs a solo shot by rusty staub of the mets and a two run blast by ralph kiner for the pirates the mets darryl strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off jesse orosco working his second inning after mookie wilson pinch ran for gary carter at second with one out and a runner on first lee mazilli was sent in to pinch hit the pirates countered with kent tekulve placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting barry bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter tekulve induced a groundout forcing strawberry at second he slid hard into honus wagner preventing the pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon tekulve allowed a hit but clemente threw mazilli out at third from near the right field line ending the inning tug mcgraw relieved randy myers who entered to pitch the eighth and got one out before bonds launched a rocket to deep center running through the stop sign at third to score an inside the park homer to win the pirates had scored an improbable straight wins and had moved to within games of first place with seven weeks to go san francisco at boswaukta august another sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule as the giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldn t tire in fact reported manager john mcgraw once this rough part of the schedule is over maybe as early as this coming week we may shift to a man rotation again for a little while juan marichal continued his hot pitching friday beating lew burdette and the braves willie mays had all four r b i s on hits rick reuschel faced joe niekro saturday in a slugfest the braves park had been a homer haven but this took the cake as the giants won a seesaw affair willie mays had three homers willie mccovey eddie matthews and don baylor had two and hank aaron ernie lombardi biz mackey and mel ott had one each the braves had collected home runs going into sunday s doubleheader putting them on a pace for which would be short of the national league record they were still a tad behind the yankees pace they had allowed over though vida blue actually got the win after retiring batters in the fifth he allowed only a run in the sixth but faltered in the seventh joe mcginnity earned the save in the doubleheader the braves hoyt wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game but hank aaron homered off bill foster in the eighth as the braves won the giants took the second game however by a score the homer by aaron was a magical by the braves however they fell to three game below making a comeback extremely unlikely san diego at cincinnati aug randy jones faced ewell blackwell in the first of this game series and the padres felt rather good with don mattingly straining his back in the last cleveland game the trade looked even better mcgriff s batting average was even rising of course the bench was very poor and joe gordon was only adequate in the outfield but these were minor problems since the pitching was holding up jones pitched a good game friday and won mcgriff launched two home runs mel harder earned a win with the help of mark davis and ray narleski saturday was the final score tom candiotti battled satchel paige to a tie through eight innings before departing the game was scoreless for more innings until the thirteenth paige had departed after and john franco hurled a scoreless inning tom browning was working his second scoreless inning when dave winfield doubled with one out and joe gordon was pitched around thurm munson doubled both runners home and the padres gamed a win the three game sweep had pulled the giants into a tie with the reds though the reds denied it the highly emotional series with the dodgers may have taken too much out of them brookangeles at houston august another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the astrodome the astros sent joe niekro to the hill in the first game opposite don drysdale normally drysdale remarked i would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them i can t afford to with this team though we have to get our own runners going we can t afford to let the astros beat us he then winked and said well maybe davis will get decked once the fact that glenn davis leads the team in homers with six is primarily why he would be decked but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season the hitting on this team is a little better but the power is all doubles and triples still carl furillo is the main reason no astro home runs were hit over the weekend as he threw two runners out trying for inside the park homers for those unaware of the nastness of the astros park they have a foot high gray wall all around the outfield balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs the foul poles are feet from home plate but the alleys are feet away with center field at feet it s as if some three year old threw a tantrum and told his playmates if i can t hit home runs nobody will hit home runs remarked roy campanella the dodgers stole five bases friday but the astros decided to revitalize the baltimore chopping that had failed weeks before for tonight anyway davis jim wynn and jose cruz did not have to mess with their swings according to the manager after poles and willie wells reached base via the baltimore chop drysdale decked jose cruz with a pitch he responded with a two run double but wynn playing first for davis popped up and the astros didn t score any more in that inning they did score in the fourth to erase a deficit and the astros wound up winning they threatened to do even better the next game as tommy john would be their opponent walt alston met privately with the starters at a m before the game i think i know how we can beat the baltimore chop he explained how can we do that pee wee reese wondered they re going to be beating the ball down so we ve got to be ready to throw on the run steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt but i want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws we ll go with a shallow infield almost the whole time the plan almost worked mike scott allowed only two runs through eight innings but the astros got three two of them scored when bill doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third astros was the final with dave smith earning another save the dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill sunday as nolan ryan walked five three of whom scored in a dodger win fernando valenzuela lost the second game to don sutton however as the dodgers thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough we re mostly a power team remarked ron cey jackie and when he plays maury wills are our only real speed demons though a couple other plays can do it now and then we re sunk in a place like the astrodome i guess that s why they re so successful there indeed it seems that basestealing

re young catchers in article blue cis pitt edu genetic pitt edu david m tate writes mss netcom com mark singer said i meant that one should not let the exception make the rule it s not an exception good players come up young most players who come up young will be good this has always been the rule are most players who come up young always good when they re young or later worse it s not a shift this is the way it has always been several detailed studies of this have been done and they ve all shown that players aren t coming up any younger or older than in the past and they aren t playing any more or less in the minors than they used to the only thing that shifts is our memories of the good old days damn i was afraid you would say that but all after the fact which makes it not applicable to the current discussion which is about how you decide whether to play the rookie who hasn t established himself in the majors over the mediocre veteran the padres played santiago that year because they clearly had nobody else worth playing well perhaps if the braves had no one else worth playing this year it would be lopez in there but they do have others worth playing at least in their opinion and i happen to agree both of these young men were highly touted defensive catchers expected to be among the best ever in baseball not by rec sport baseball consensus that may sound like an incredibly arrogant comment but i ve found that the sdcn consensus when one exists is right far more often than the media consensus or the opinions of baseball people affiliated with mlb i can believe that i m a newbie here so i ll take your word but alomar is a fine defensive catcher which was my statement above that is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age as long as they feel he can also hit a bit lopez does not have such a consensus about his defensive prowess and imho that is enough to give him that dreaded seasoning i don t know who knows i suppose the same people or similar who know he will be better than some other catcher these are of course just differing opinions i read that his arm is not that strong i suppose somewhere there is some measurement of sb ratios and that he is still learning to call a game that latter skill may be difficult to project on someone without an intimate knowledge of his performance but it is a tangible skill i disagree in that i don t think it is a tangible skill any more than leadership is i don t deny that it is a real skill and that some catchers may be much better than others at it but i really don t see any way that we could ever know who they are nichols s law of catcher defense is eerily accurate far too often for me to take defensive assessments of catchers very seriously sorry new don t know nichols law don t believe in catchers era but i am interested in pitchers eras with different catchers any info on that absolutely the evidence is piling up year after year the only other alternative is that the braves really don t know that their young players are on average better than their current starters i m not ruling out that kind of gross incompetence but i think the salary schedule explanation is more charitable in other words we know more than they do so the only logic behind a different decision than we would make must be financial i presume we feel this way about other franchises than atlanta no consider we know that the braves are about the strongest team in baseball right now even with olson and lemke and nixon and bream in the lineup they have as good a chance of repeating as champs this year as any team ever has it actually makes some sense to say rather than making our team marginally better this year by bringing up the young studs and dumping the elderly let s go ahead and compete this year with what we have and then bring up the studs only as we have to so that we ll still have them under reserve three years from now and beyond when the current team will be collecting pensions is it fair to the young players no does it make organizational sense i think it does well if it does make organizational sense one can hardly fault them for their decisions i mean please don t tell me how to run my business especially when i m being successful c i could make it or wins if you let me bring up lopez s listen bobby i d like to but the way i see it if he hits the big club this year we ll be paying mega arbitration bucks down the road in a couple of years and there s no way i want to do that and continues with we can win without him and then keep winning next year with him how s that i m sure you could be right you could also be smoking some illegal substance hey that s a joke don t get offended please hey i d love to be wrong about this if you think it s unlikely i d love to know why don t cite anybody s innate ethical rectitude though unless you know them personally well i can t cite anyone s ethical rectitude because i don t know what it means but again if it makes organizational sense then so be it baseball is a business and if there is a solid business reason for keeping lopez on the farm then that s what the braves should do i happen to believe that it s a baseball decision while you from your armchair may disagee i don t i think there is a lot of evidence to suggest the decision they made i predicted it among large guffaws from several at the start of spring training i think it is a very normal decision to have made it is certainly more reversible than to have started lopez in the bigs and have released one of their catchers sure it may be conservative it may also be logical i don t know what ethics have to do with it seems like pretty good common sense to me the beastmaster mark singer mss netcom com

re young catchers mss netcom com mark singer said we know that very very few players at this age make much of an impact in the bigs especially when they haven t even played aaa ball yes but this is irrelevant you re talking about averages when we have lots of information about this player in particular to base our decisions on i might as well say we know that very very few people are more than feet tall so chances are that manute bol is really only foot no maybe i need to improve my writing skills lopez who is very ordinary defensively is not likely to hit so well at age having not played at aaa level that it is probably not a good idea to rush him into the braves lineup in why isn t lopez likely to hit that well he hit that well last year after adjusting his stats for park and league and such he hit better on an absolute scale than olson or berryhill did by a lot as for rushing if there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment and i don t believe there is then wouldn t you rather waste lopez s year old good season than his year old very good season or his year old excellent season the sooner you get him acclimated the more of his prime you get to use lopez was hitting over ab when he was cut from spring training what does he have to do to earn a chance maybe not a full time job but at least a couple starts and a few ab for him to prove his worth gee i don t know abs sounds pretty good to me about as good as your reasoning that the kid should play a back up role rather than start every day at aaa talk about me as a gm the point was not that ab is a significant sample but rather that he hadn t done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real or to send him down until he gets warmed up ok most players are not ready for the bigs at age most players are never ready for the bigs what does this have to do with javy lopez most players benefit rather than being stagnant or hurt by playing at aaa see above most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their clubs in the bigs those are the arguments against lopez for the braves for this year but i could apply the same reasoning to frank thomas or barry bonds most players aren t that good so they probably won t be that good this year either now the braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid abilities to call games to work with the pitchers to throw out runners and demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble not superstars mind you but solid experienced veterans not superstars not stars not even good players maybe average if we re being charitable the braves have a very solid lineup with two big bats in the outfield an excellent platoon at first a solid mvp candidate at third and one of the better hitting shortstops ummm justice is a very fine hitter pendleton might have another big year in his bat but he might also spend the season in hamstring hell gant is a big question mark the bream hunter platoon is decent not excellent and has rotten obp or slg depending on who s in blauser is a very valuable bat for a shortstop the center field platoon will probably hit however good lopez bat might be given the above it won t be so much better than what they have to offset the differential in experience and defensive ability wanna bet the difference between lopez s bat and olson berryhill could be or runs over the course of the season given a choice between a player with experience and a player who can play i ll take the latter every time the kid will improve playing at aaa just like keith mitchell did i am just so surprised i have to spell all of this out my goodness do you believe the other poster who thinks lopez is being held down because of his future earning potential that was me and you so far your only counter proposal is that they really don t understand how good lopez is or overvalue experience or some combination of the two i think my interpretation was more flattering to the organization are they idiots who have built this ballclub well argued but inflammatory reply deleted david m tate i do not know what it is about you that closes posing as and opens only something in me understands e e can the pocket of your glove is deeper than pete rose s dy cummings nobody not even tim raines has such soft hands
re young catchers mss netcom com mark singer said in article blue cis pitt edu genetic pitt edu david m tate writes well perhaps if the braves had no one else worth playing this year it would be lopez in there but they do have others worth playing at least in their opinion catcher is their weakest position with the possible exception of second base they have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem spot with a well above average offensive player and acclimate a highly promising potential star with no pressure on him to carry the team and they want to play olson and berryhill instead i disagree in that i don t think it is a tangible skill any more than leadership is i don t deny that it is a real skill and that some catchers may be much better than others at it but i really don t see any way that we could ever know who they are nichols s law of catcher defense is eerily accurate far too often for me to take defensive assessments of catchers very seriously sorry new don t know nichols law a catcher s defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his recent offensive level of performance thus mickey tettleton goes in the media from being a no hit defensive whiz to a slugging thumb finger in two short years the rule doesn t apply to perceived superstars who get the gold glove offensive transfer effect instead greg olson is probably considered to be a good defensive catcher precisely because he can t hit don t believe in catchers era but i am interested in pitchers eras with different catchers aren t they the same thing in other words we know more than they do so the only logic behind a different decision than we would make must be financial either that or just stupidity i presume we feel this way about other franchises than atlanta no of course is it fair to the young players no does it make organizational sense i think it does well if it does make organizational sense one can hardly fault them for their decisions i mean please don t tell me how to run my business especially when i m being successful one could make the same sort of argument in other cases pete rose in pursuing ty cobb s record was a huge gate attraction and national media magnet the reds made a lot of money off that they also wasted the prime of eric davis that may be good business but that doesn t mean i don t loathe them for it david m tate i do not know what it is about you that closes posing as and opens only something in me understands e e can the pocket of your glove is deeper than pete rose s dy cummings nobody not even tim raines has such soft hands

braves win opener well maddux looked excellent as the braves shutout the cubs justice drove in the only run with an rbi single in the first get ready for him to have a monster year he is now hitting the ball to the opposite field with a lot of power to go with his natural power to right field and his good batting eye if he stays healthy which he should his back is full strength this year he should get over rbi and close to hr in another note the marlins got off to a good start beating the dodgers i believe the score was but i m not sure i wish them and the rockies well this year hell i think it would be funny to watch the dodgers hit the cellar again this year dan smith

re young catchers since i was the one responsible for these divergent threads of approx posts going back to the braves could be better off if an injury happens i may as well inject a little more fuel to the flame back at the beginning of spring training i though lopez would make the squad easily olson was still recovering from his late season injury knee i believe and there were questions as to whether he would be able to play before june and then berryhill was dinged up i was looking forward to this because i believe that lopez can hit and field the position before last season he was the braves defensive catcher prospect while brian deak was the braves offensive catcher prospect besides olson and berryhill couldn t hit their way out of a wet cardboard box and don t walk enough to be useful but olson recovered quickly berryhill recovered and the braves went with the two vets i still say that if one of those two had been down at the start of the season he wouldn t have gotten his job back there is a certain logic to keeping olson and berryhill around after all ml catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and tear there are teams out there without one average ml catcher california and seattle come to mind certainly trying to move olson or berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work plus you d have to eat that salary which isn t huge but isn t tiddleywinks either i think olson s at about berryhill at but that s only what i recall yes i think arbitration eligibility may have a role to play in this also what is it that of the year players aren t eligible for arbitration only the that were on the roster the longest are eligible of course the system may change but the extent of that change is not yet known from a business standpoint it may make sense to keep lopez down until june the first time olson berryhill go on the dl i am still disappointed that lopez isn t on the team i still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the braves and the truth is that i d rather see our best team on the field which imo includes lopez of course today we play the cubs hopefully we won t need him as for the schuerholz cox conversation i imagine it went like this remember they ve both been gm s the following is not meant to be read by the humor impaired cox ok we ve sent jones down his fielding could be a little smoother besides blauser can hit ok and his fielding is better than it used to be schuerholz well we ll have to send nieves down too deion just won t sign that baseball only contract we can t count on him in october so we have to keep nixon around for the defense besides gorman s not ready to give up on billy hatcher yet once hatcher s gone and deion signs we can move nixon for frankie rodriguez that ought to give us some pitching depth in cox yep that ll be nice too bad deion won t sign ok i ll look for nieves when justice starts having berry berry er back problems again now what about klesko schuerholz well we ve still got to fork out another mil for bream if we keep klesko we either lose the money or cabrera i keep dangling sid in front of dal maxwell but somehow he doesn t seem to be the same gm first jeffries for jose and now whiten for clark if he gets rid of brian jordan then i d have to believe that he and whitey herzog switched bodies at the winter meetings cox ok keep trying on bream and i ll wait til the trading deadline for my hunter klesko platoon maybe i can get a few extra at bats for cabrera while we wait try california if snow starts slowly maybe whiteydal will bite on sid and if that doesn t work then perhaps sid s knees could be persuaded to act up there s always the day dl mwa ha ha ha ha schuerholz what about caraballo cox well he s not that much better than lemke maybe if he starts in richmond he ll start walking more besides if he s going to be arbitration eligible better to stretch him out so that we actually get some value from him before he makes the big bucks schuerholz now let s see that leaves lopez cox nooooo i gotta keep lopez sure i didn t think olson would recover this quickly maybe i can talk caminiti into running into him again schuerholz nope lopez has gotta go you know that he ll get million in arbitration may as well put it off that one extra year besides until olson s shown his stuff a little bit i can t trade him besides berryhill s a left handed hitter you know how rare that is cox don t you mean a left handed whiffer pretty common if you ask me i mean he made pat borders look good in the world series pat borders schuerholz hey you re the one who wouldn t write lopez into the lineup cox well you re the one who went out and got me jeff reardon besides i thought lopez wouldn t be used to our pitching staff s stuff he got some time with them this spring looked pretty good come on surely we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate schuerholz yeah but which stiff whichever one we keep will be hurt by may cox ok ok you made your point keep them both surely one of them will be on the dl by june at the latest then i can call up lopez and then we can win games the pennant the world series i ll be up there with john mcgraw casey stengel earl weaver oh they laughed at me in toronto but have you ever had to deal with george bell i ll finally get my just reward mwa ha ha ha schuerholz easy bobby have you been taking

re young catchers most of this discussion has been between mark singer and david tate with valentine weighing in on the same side as dave at various times my opinion fwiw to all mark age doesn t matter ability does i would rather have the untried rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven himself to be average at best i don t care if he is if he plays better than what i have i want him out there sandy alomar had decent minor league numbers grossly inflated by the pcl in general and las vegas in particular he should have been projected as an average major league hitter which is good for a catcher i ll admit santiago s numbers would probably come out the same as sandy s but i don t have the league data from the mid s to check it out that being said i agree with sending lopez to richmond at least to start the season as the box below shows he has one minor league season in which he hit well he has two in which he hit very very poorly i want to see that the lopez is real olson and berryhill are not complete mediocrities for catchers especially nl catchers they are essentially average hitters with equivalent averages around if he had hit well at prior levels i would say he belongs on the braves but there is a reasonable chance that lopez last year was just as much a fluke as alomar in or santiago in one year at any level at any age doesn t satisfy my standards of evidence javier lopez bur dur grn atl maj min tot maj min tot on a similar note i don t understand why more people are not supportive of neon deion granted i thought his behavior with mccarver last year was completely bush last year was the first time he ever got ab in one place so his lines are hard to read but he has a combined ops in minor league play with his speed is more valuable than the ops alone indicates and at a still young age had a monster year with an ops he has a total major and minor eqa of above major league average and above average for cf which was about in the nl last year he has shown at least the potential of going into the s which would make him one of the best hitters in the league he has two full seasons before reaching his prime season of he should be considered as a legitimate prospect and not as a simple side show attraction deion sanders fla int eas nyy int nyy int atl ric atl maj min tot maj min tot clay d

re rickey henderson and michael jackson jack nicholson and bill cosby wouldn t be making near as much money if they weren t entertainers so what s your point actually i could care less what his salary is it has something to do with the fact that we live in america and everyone is entitled to whatever he can legally obtain if sandy alderson and the haas family willingly negotiate a salary of million per year with rickey i couldn t care less but what really gets my goat is the bullshit he spouted in spring training about well sometimes i may not play as hard or might be hurt more often in a place where i m not appreciated this quote was in the chronicle about the second week of camp and strongly suggests that he was going to dog it all year if the ownership didn t kiss his butt and ante up some more money for god s sake rickey you signed a contract years ago now honor it and play say all you want to about steve garvey and believe me i hated him too but at least when he put his signature on a piece of paper he shut his mouth and played hard until the contract was up matt bohnert

re braves pitching updatedir in article apr pts mot com ep dn pts mot com dave naehring x p writes in article adobe com snichols adobe com sherri nichols writes every single piece of evidence we can find points to major league baseball being offense defense a run scored is just as important as a run prevented this certainly passes the common sense test for me but is there any statistical evidence to say what percent of defense is pitching and what percent is fielding i d really like to know btw sherri thanks for the da data i find it fascinating of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented just as a penny saved is a penny earned enough with the cliches my point is that if the braves starters are able to live up to their potential they won t need much offensive support i realize this is a big if this staff leaves the bosox in the dust there is no legitimate comparison two cy young winners and three other pitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first or second starter it seems to me that when quality pitchers take the mound the other teams score less runs the team that scores the most runs wins this puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs a low scoring game would clearly benefit the braves they should have many low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting on the flip side if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players i would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers they would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their opponent the name of the games is to win even ray knight knows that you do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard all i m trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers like the braves have the offense doesn t need to be as strong sam dave sherri nichols snichols adobe com

texas chicago california kansas city seattle you all know how things turned out the orioles red sox and yankees all disappeared the jays and tigers continued at essentially the expected pace the brewers and indians cranked in the second half the rangers predictably took a dive that shouldn t have surprised anybody meanwhile as predicted the mariners dropped behind the angels and royals they clearly didn t deserve the record in june the white sox and a s upped their game a bit while the twins dropped off a little but for the most part things were as expected okay so there were a few

out none of them won though mussina might have had a chance with better relief and more starts nobody else in the division is worth a darn they all finish a minimum of fifteen games out the tribe that s another reason to watch baltimore this year and next they won t waste many of those games against the rest of the division except for the brewers who you probably forgot you were right the rest of

necessarily all the same years as they win this one will take a long time to verify i don t think i want to wait that long but they won games last year and they were fifth in the league in era not a bad start ben mcdonald will not challenge for an era title in the next years nor will he have victories either year by challenge i mean finish among the leaders being among the leaders before the season is done doesn t count he will probably never be the pitcher he was hyped to be but is still a decent starter to have looks like it he wasn t bad last year just too consistent to be an ace so far this year looks like more of the same the phillies will give up many fewer walks if when they get rid of their bullpen coach ryan i am not predicting when or whether they will get rid of him and you will have to give the team a little bit of time to adjust before seeing the radical change they would have a fine pitching staff if they would just steal ray miller away from pittsburg the white sox seem to have the same problem but not as bad i honestly can t say did they get rid of him their bb totals were down last year ricky jordan will have rbi if he starts games hitting in the or or spot in any lineup or the spot in a lineup with very good obp in the hitters this applies for each of the next years i just don t think he s that good billy ripken will never again hit over with ab so far so good i m definitely not waiting to check this one from panix spira cmcl nyu edu fri sep no matter what lou gorman and his scouts say paul quantrill will never ever be an adequate major league starter never i have never seen a starting pitcher who can only strike out per innings at aaa be successful in the majors current plans seem to be to use quantrill in long relief he has a rubber arm

might have been right from trn strdev jhuapl edu tue mar are the o s going to sign cal of is eli s wallet welded shut outgoing money only wide open for incoming cash my prediction which you may make note of valentine is that eli jacobs will defer any serious negotiations on cal ripken s contract until the season is over eli will give cal every opportunity to have his stats tumble a bit from last year s pace before coming forth with an offer despite claims that op cy was designed to cal s strength my feeling is that the foot left center canyon will cut down on cal s power stats after all it s hard to credibly to offer million year to an all star game mvp al mvp gold glove shortstop baseball deity but it d be a lot easier to offer a similar salary to an obviously declining but above average shortstop who had a career year one full season ago of course if cal does match his numbers then eli is going to be faced with a rather huge and expensive problem how much did cal sign for when did he sign if i remember correctly he got a rather hefty contract despite a weak season and finally from jpalmer uwovax uwo ca thu sep generally because of expansion in there will be a lot of mediocre talent hanging around much of it will not make it as the expansion teams look for younger talent around which to build their teams my specific predictions as of april jim acker and cory snider will be selling aluminum siding snyder is still in sf acker is gone neither charlie kerfeld nor vance lovelace presently in tiger aa but formerly big leaguers will be playing professional ball they aren t in the majors nor will dave rozema who says he s keeping in shape with a hope for another shot with expansion never heard of him shawn hare and jody hurst will be in the major leagues they are outfielders in the tiger minor league system i don t think they are in the majors ron hassey will be a minor league manager with the yankees dunno what happened to him it will be bye bye for balboni if he s still around he s stuck in the minors bo jackson will not be a starter hm with raines out bo looks to get a lot of pt gary huckaby will have moved to alaska permanently they re on the net and dave kirsch will return to canada to live hm thanks for listening valentine

re braves pitching updatedir sbp acad drake edu said in article adobe com snichols adobe com sherri nichols writes every single piece of evidence we can find points to major league baseball being offense defense a run scored is just as important as a run prevented of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented just as a penny saved is a penny earned enough with the cliches it s not a cliche and unlike your comments below it s not a tautology it needn t have been true if every pitcher in baseball were essentially the same in quality i e if the variance of pitching ability were much smaller than the variance of batting ability then scoring runs would be much more important than preventing them simply because the ability to actively prevent runs would be much weaker my point is that if the braves starters are able to live up to their potential they won t need much offensive support if that s your point you should have said so what you in fact said was pitching and defense win championships and later pitching is the essence of baseball neither of which says what you are now claiming was your point and neither of which is true it seems to me that when quality pitchers take the mound the other teams score less runs the team that scores the most runs wins and you accuse sherri of mouthing cliches this puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs a low scoring game would clearly benefit the braves it s not clear to me at all that this is true in high scoring games the team with the better offense wins a high percentage of the time in low scoring games the split is essentially regardless of team ability they should have many low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting on the flip side if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players i would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers i thought you said pitching and defense win championships and pitching is the essence of baseball david m tate dtate pitt edu greetings sir with bat not quick member iie orsa tims sabr hands not soft eye not discerning and in denver they call you a slugger the big catullus galarraga and compare you to my own mattingly

re pleasant yankee surprises in article netnews upenn edu sepinwal mail sas upenn edu alan sepinwall writes some pleasant and then some not so pleasant surprises about the edition of the bronx bombers so far first the pleasant spike owen all through spring training this guy was looking like the second coming of mike gallego but with even worse hitting now the guy is third in the major leagues in ba and he s ranked pretty high in total hits and runs scored i know it s still early in the season but he and pat kelly more on him in a minute have provided a lot of spark at the bottom of the order that s given the big guys mattingly tartabull o neill plenty of rbi opportunities let s hope he keeps this up pat kelly the guy is finally showing some of the ability that led stick michael to label him a star for the s i wouldn t go that far but kelly looks infinitely improved at bat i guess the tips he took from boggs in spring training really paid off huh and here i thought boggs would never do anything to help anybody besides himself and his glove like always has been terrific he and mattingly comprise the best defensive right side of the infield in all of baseball imho paul o neill we had to get rid of roberto kelly partly because he was under too much pressure in ny to be the next barry bonds he won t do that in cincy either and partly because he had this real unprofessional tendency to give up in the second half of the year i just felt that we could ve gotten more for him than o neill well so far o neill is turning out just fine he looks like he should be able to duplicate if not surpass mel hall s numbers from last year and he keeps opposing pitchers from pitching around tartabull now if only buck would play him against lefties some more to see what he can do wickman a friend made a comparison between wickman and jack morris they never have impressive stats but they always find some way to win although morris seems to be losing that ability i figured that wickman would be the least important part of the steve sax trade best trade since we got that ruth guy maybe winding up as a good middle reliever but i like what i ve seen so far he doesn t pitch pretty but he gets the job done key what s going on here key was just supposed to provide the rotation with some stability you know shore up the left side provide experience get maybe wins and here this guy is dominating everybody he faces who needs maddux or cone i ll take key any day and now the not so pleasant surprises spike owen sure he s hitting like crazy but the guy cannot field to save his life and they said he was brought in to provide defense velarde stankiewicz and even silvestri are better defensively than owen remember it s still early look for his offense to tail off and his defense to improve hopefully he has that rep because i heard that either last year or over the last years or something like that he has the third highest fielding percentage among major league shortstops behind c r and tony i m not gonna help this sorry mets team at all fernandez i do agree though that he has not looked all that impressive in the field thus far tartabull the book on tartabull was keep him healthy and he ll produce well he hasn t done too much so far sure he s hit a few homers but those were all solo shots and he hasn t gotten any of the big rbis that your cleanup man is supposed to give you then again he had a slow start last year once he got off the dl that is and turned into a one man wrecking crew late in the year so we ll see the bullpen ugh what happened we were supposed to have one of the most solid pens in the majors meanwhile the pen has already blown three saves maybe more i haven t checked the great howe farr lefty righty tandem farr s era is in the s or s and howe s is infinite i didn t think such a thing was possible but it is hopefully they ll get their acts together or else buck s gonna burn out the starters for fear that the bullpen ll blow a lead in the immortal words of the scooter holy cow seaver that johnny key guy can pitch can t he see you in the series alan

zane rescue us from simmons so far simmons looks like a total idiot zane smith should learn how to switchpitch and return from the dl i would rather have zane smith pitch right handed than have moeller pitch at all i am sure simmons was ready to say i told you so after otto had an impressive win last week now otto s latest debacle has restored simmon s reputation now he looks like he is back in his form when he had the al s highest era among starters four our sake not ted s sake i hope he pitches with a era for the rest of the season yeah right tomlin and merced are a bit disappointing they are still doing decently but considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have shown their first seasons they seem to have actually gotten a little bit worse tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters merced had a very good oba his rookie year he showed a lot of concentration at the plate in his rookie year walk well he seems to be on the losing end tonight but i still think that walk desrved his contract leyland should accept a part of the blame for the lavalliere situation i can t understand his and management s fear of losing tom prince through waivers even if they do what s the use he is aright hander like slaught not a very smart platoon also i am blaming leyland in this case since he is hcurrently convinced that lavalliere is through while giving him way too much time last year in the regular season and the playoffs slaught should have played in all games he has a good average against right handed pitching didn t leyland and simmons forsee this last year and attempt to trade lavalliere last year itself any fool could tell them lavalliere wasn t very fit last year dennis moeller is scary candeleria well he is not going to have such a high era at the end of the season maybe it will be in range but million plus come on other than the customary home run giving stage patterson goes through for a few weeks patterson has served the pirates very well each year so far he seems to have pitched well for the rangers i think the pirates should have spent the money on patterson in stead the rookie batters well young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact other than that their excellent performance hasn t been too much of a surprise i think we should thank doughty for that rookie pitchers worse than expected especially cooke slaught how come he wasn t given a contract extension last year now his value has increased immensely lonnie smith well eric davis was signed for a comparable amount let s see eric can hit better he can run better he can field better now why didnt the pirates go after eric davis an injured davis is better than a healthy lonnie smith even if lonnnie smith gets some big hits this year he won t be an asset he has looked terrible on the bases and in the field management big big zero sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement in favor of revenue sharing he seems more concerned about pleasing that idiot danforth by preparing the team for a move to tampa bay alex cole fiasco the pirates infield and cf positions look good the rf and lf would have looked good if we could have gotten cole to replace two of the four outfielders eric davis van slyke and cole would have made a very respectable outfield even without eric davis thye pirates would have a respectable outfield with cole svan slyke and merced i think he should hit left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting simmons did have options for the outfield ironically the biggest accomplishment of simmon s tenure was getting alex cole really cheap too bad compensatory draft picks for bonds forget it the pirates can rant and rave they will not get those picks as of now the issue is still being appealed now if this doesnt convince anyone that simmons and sauer are idiots nothing else will on a final note tim wakefield won t be as awful as he was in his last starts but don t count on him pitching like last year for the rest of the season also if the pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the season they will miss redus s clutch hitting and his speed he has peaked in the second half of the last seasons pravin ratnam

re zane rescue us from simmons mamatha devineni ratnam mr andrew cmu edu writes so far simmons looks like a total idiot whatever you say i think it s just games into the season myself so i m going to wait a bit before calling names i am sure simmons was ready to say i told you so after otto had an impressive win last week now otto s latest debacle has restored simmons reputation now he looks like he is back in his form when he had the al s highest era among starters four our sake not ted s sake i hope he pitches with a era for the rest of the season yeah right i expect that dave otto will be a really bad pitcher and i have no idea why simmons ever wanted him on the other hand i expect him to release otto if he doesn t turn things around pretty fast btw otto s game score for that ip stinker was only which points out a problem with the method since otto s performance was infinitely bad and excruciatingly prolonged tomlin and merced are a bit disappointing they are still doing decently but considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have shown their first seasons they seem to have actually gotten a little bit worse i think merced s rookie year was a bit flukey but aren t you willing to give him some more at bats and tomlin a few more starts before acting so gloomy walk well he seems to be on the losing end tonight but i still think that walk desrved his contract no he didn t walk is a time bomb he has no stuff whatsoever and when the league finally realizes this it won t be pretty at all the rookie batters well young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact other than that their excellent performance hasn t been too much of a surprise i think we should thank doughty for that don t be so fast doughty is the guy who signed steve buechele which was a move that threatened to bury kevin young in the minors meanwhile i m not sure whether doughty or simmons signed martin as a six year free agent before the season rookie pitchers worse than expected especially cooke twice through the rotation and you ve given up yikes slaught how come he wasn t given a contract extension last year now his value has increased immensely but so has his age at least in baseball terms the useful half life of a year old injury prone catcher can t be much longer than a year lonnie smith well eric davis was signed for a comparable amount but he wanted to be a dodger and felt he had something to prove after his disastrous i don t think there was any chance for the bucs to sign him let s see eric can hit better he can run better he can field better now why didnt the pirates go after eric davis an injured davis is better than a healthy lonnie smith he certainly wasn t last year even if lonnnie smith gets some big hits this year he won t be an asset he has looked terrible on the bases and in the field hey that s the skates smith package deal anybody who acquires lonnie for his defense or base running particularly at this stage is a real weirdo management big big zero sauer has yet to make a forceful argument in favor of revenue sharing he seems more concerned about pleasing that idiot danforth by preparing the team for a move to tampa bay if that s the goal of the team ownership than i don t see why sauer gets a zero for making his boss happy i don t know what he has or hasn t said about revenue sharing so i can t comment there alex cole fiasco stuff deleted ironically the biggest accomplishment of simmons tenure was getting alex cole really cheap too bad that he gave him away in the expansion draft it s annoying but since leyland seems to have been pushing for them to retain jeff king it was probably unavoidable meanwhile i think bigger accomplishments of simmons tenure were getting some value for john smiley not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch last year drafting well in letting the rookies show something in foley smith and candelaria were acquired to be replacement parts which means that even if fail it hasn t done serious damage to the bucs future compensatory draft picks for bonds forget it the pirates can rant and rave they will not get those picks as of now the issue is still being appealed does this mean that the bucs lost the initial arbitration case i never heard the outcome of this when will the final verdict be in on this now if this doesnt convince anyone that simmons and sauer are idiots nothing else will i m not sure who was the idiot in this case so i don t know who to blame it might have been doug danforth after all in fact i seriously suspect it was doug danforth who has shown his willingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is pointed at his feet btw i ve wondered whether my latest posts have been getting off site so if somebody known to impersonate e e cummings can see this would he drop me a short note jking
re dodger question the dodgers have been shopping harris to other teams in their quest for more left handed pitching so far no takers personally i think harris is a defensive liability and he has also led the team in past years for hitting into double plays or at least been among the leaders sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play every day he can get the job done if sharpy played just one base every day say third he d also improve defensively wallach has helped tremendously on defense as has reed the improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an effect on the pitching staff both astacio and martinez were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might have seen him lifted in the third in past years astacio lasted innings the other day under similar circumstances the dodgers are turning double plays and keeping more balls in the infield than last year and piazza has also been great on defense he has thrown out of batters trying to steal and has at least one pick off at first wallach clearly has contributed to the over all improvement on defense but his offense is awful and he has cost the dodgers some runs but i don t think he is as bad as his current average i suspect he will come out of this slump much as davis and straw seem to have come out of theirs dodger

re dave kingman for the hall of fame in article apr news yale edu steve tomassi writes hi baseball fans so what do you say don t you think he deserves it i mean heck if dave winfield ho hum is seriously being considered for it as is lee smith ha then why don t we give dave kingman a chance or darrell evans yeah yeah after the hall of fame takes in them it can take in eddie murray and jeff reardon oh yeah dave winfield marginal player guy didn t hit a lick had negligible power was a crap fielder and had no staying power dave winfield now entering his i believe th big league season is still a damn decent hitter admittedly his defense has slipped a great deal but in his prime he had a powerful arm and great range take a look at the stats i don t know where you even begin to make an argument that winfield and kingman are similar players kingman was a one dimension power hitter he couldn t field he ran like an anvil hit for a low average though if i remember right his obp wasn t that hideous and for those who consider such things important was a absolute primo dick eddie murray yup only the best st baseman of the s i know that mvp votes are conducted by mediots but given that he got jobbed out of the mvp he deserved in it seems that he wasn t overrated by the media lee smith hmmmm this one s actually pretty close he s had a s solid dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks wrigley fenway i d have to take a closer look at the stats it s been a while but it seems lee arthur is of hof caliber you do make a legitimate point about the hof credentials of relievers simply racking up a lot of saves doesn t mean a whole hell of a lot if you blow a bunch too simply because minnesota and boston and for a month atlanta used reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one the equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves no way should homerman be in the hof imho darrell evans nice career actually a bit underrated kinda like ted simmons imho but not a hof er well in any case i am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody giving hall of fame consideration to players that are by today s standards marginal lemme ask you this who the hell playing the game isn t marginal honestly ozzie smith and robin yount don t belong there they re both shortstops that just hung around for a long time big deal let s be a little more selective huh stop handing out these honors so liberally save them for the guys who really deserve it face it if something now wait a goddamn minute here ozzie smith absolutely redefined the position of shortstop his defense was so good that he s won something along the lines of gold gloves again gold gloves are mediot biased and a good argument could be made that larkin deserved one or two of ozzie s more recent awards but usually this is tempered by someone else in the early s getting the gold gloves ozzie deserved earlier in his career ozzie s offense you ask good obp great speed numbers in a park which for most of his career depressed offense admittedly no power cept against tom niedenfuer but still a definite asset offensively yount hits mvp at two different positions uh huh a real stiff his was one of the great years ever by a player in recent memory and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of wagner and banks as far as ss numbers go he s a clear hof er imho isn t done there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore when certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential candidates the absurdity is apparent gee can these guys even compare to the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan well as far as garvey goes you re right garvey is a mediot candidate pushed because of his winning attitude a minor factor if one at all and his great defense no errors admittedly but the range of a tree stump garvey shouldn t be in the hof skyjack i ve said a lot of nasty things about skyjack in the last year or so but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about morris ability to win which is nothing more than morris ability to pitch when toronto to score tons of runs at this point morris is an average pitcher although from his early returns in he may be damned close to done but in all fairness morris was a dominant pitcher in the s for up and down tiger teams while was obviously a great year for detroit the rest of the decade the team was generally in contention but not favorites morris career numbers are quite good and worthy of hof consideration ryan of course but be careful i guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about yount and smith being shortstops who hung around a long time after all nolan never won a cy damn he s just pitcher who hung around for years his w l record is mediocre of course nolan s a hof er puck probably although he s got to play reasonably well for a few more years years even good ones aren t enough to make the hof most likely that said i believe puckett will make the hof pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out barring something really tragic or sudden he s very popular in the media and with fans and legitimately has been one of the best cf s in the game since he joined the league i ve always liked the guy and i hope he does make it and in the end i think the puck will make it in but really it s too early to sell this debate comes up rather frequently on the net and believe it or not i never tire of it it s an interesting subject here s an off the top of my head list of potential hof ers from each team i probably left a couple of guys off so feel free to follow up i won t consider anyone who started playing after about again too early to tell note these are all active players i m not counting recent retirees baltimore cal ripken should be a lock by now even if gehrig s record stands boston roger clemens might be a lock already which is amazing dawson detroit alan trammell and lou whitaker possibilities milwaukee robin yount discussed earlier new york wade boggs possibly mattingly long shot toronto paul molitor and jack morris possibilities kansas city george brett lock minnesota kirby too early to tell winfield lock oakland eckersley lock mcgwire too early rickey lock welch long shot texas the mighty nolan too early to consider canseco or strange

you los angeles butler strawberry and hershiser are all long shots san diego tony gwynn pretty good shot colorado dale murphy a good shot ryan bowen just to see if you re awake before i get flames

re baseballisdead in article apr midway uchicago edu as midway uchicago edu writes my question to you all is why does the media seem to embrace the theme of the death of baseball so strongly i have seen articles of a similar vein in the chicago tribune and in sports editorials on tv maybe because baseball is the only business where those who are responsible for the fiscal aspects of the game preach gloom and doom these allegedly intelligent people seem to predict bad times losing money bankruptcies at an alarming rate and there s going to be an increased degradation of the product they produce could you imagine ibm with all their problems promoting themselves the way major league baseball does their stock would plummet to unthinkable depths not that they are too far from it now what would happen at gm where would gm be if they admitted to cutting corners and producing an inferior product because of alleged labor problems i think it shows a lack of confidence for the people who run the game anyway it just frustrates me when the media says such things because it inevitably leads to owners trying quick fixes like increasing play offs to satisfy television or trying interleague play to drum up interest forget it word has it three divisions with a wild card is just about a done deal it has to be decided soon since negotiations with the networks also have to begin soon scott barman mets mailing list feed the following into your shell scott asd com mail mets request asd com subscribe let s go mets

re jose canseco s swing vs in article c jkik zf ucdavis edu ez dale ucdavis edu gary built like villanueva huckabay writes here s my analysis of jose canseco circa sep and jose canseco circa june he s bulked up too much period he needs to lose about pounds not gain more bulk i ve been saying that for at least years now and even the a s conditioning guru told jose he was carrying too much weight and losing some would help his back although i don t for one second believe jose used steroids his back problems are very similar to problems alot of steroid users experience because they are simply carrying too much weight on their frame see jeff bregel ex er as a textbook example and imho jose is too big for his frame his bat speed has absolutely vanished conservatively i d say he s lost of his bat speed and that s a huge amount of speed i can t imagine how to estimate bat speed but its pretty obvious that jose is missing fastballs he used to hit likely due to his back that open stance is killing him note that he acts sort of like brian downing way open to start then closes up as ball is released downing could do this without significant head movement canseco can t also note that canseco doesn t always close his stance the same way sometimes his hips are open sometimes they re fully closed without a good starting point it s hard to make adjustments in your swing i don t know he had an even more open stance when he first came up with the a s and had no problems with it then it might be that pre back problems he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance caused but now he s lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts him the old saying if you re hot its a trigger mechanism if you re cold its a hitch first minimize movement before the swing close and widen the stance and severely cut down the stride i take on my swing hopefully this will cut down on the time i need to swing and will allow me to move the bathead more freely the biggest problem imho is he never has found a stance he s comfortable with for more than a few months he changes his stance so much he loses track of where the strike zone is in wednesday s night game he was clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to me i think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because he s changed his stance so much i m also a bit concerned that because he s got palmer and gonzalez hitting all the homeruns he ll become competitive swing even harder and screw himself up even worse larussa always said that canseco s famous batting practice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged bad hitting habits russ smith i don t know anything about x s but i know about some o george gervin on being an assistant coach
re the phillies deja vu robert c hite philly bach udel edu wrote i think most of the problems mainly arose from manager gene mauch s ineptitude in managing the pitching staff down the stretch he abused jim bunning chris short and robin roberts i think those are the three pitching each on only days rest for quite some time by the time they hit the last weeks of the season obviously none of these guys had an ounce left in their arm oh well roberts was long gone he was probably an oriole in or maybe a colt the rd starter was art mahaffey the previous year s ace dennis bennett was the th starter they were indeed up with to go but they won their final two games after the horrid loss streak the final game victory bunning s th win if memory serves kept the reds from tying for the title they and the phils were both game behind the cards with the giants another game back the mets couldn t hold an early lead against the cards that final sunday or there would have been a way tie too bad they couldn t have saved some of the or so runs they scored on saturday when they crushed st louis neal traven pitt edu you re only young once but you can be traven vms cis pitt edu immature forever larry andersen

hal mcrae dak s vma smsu edu writes no hal mcrae is the worst manager in baseball i haven t seen enough royals games to judge his tactics so you may have a point here but i ve never seen a guy who can waste talent like he can one of the best raw talent staffs in the league and he s still finding a way to lose imo the royals don t have a chance to win the pennant even if mcrae suddenly began channeling for john mcgraw ok they have some decent pitchers but when your offense consists of bums like gagne and lind and mcreynolds and mcrae and an over the hill brett you re not going to finish unless mcgraw brings christy mathewson back with him i d say it is hard to evaluate a manager when all of his hitters suck bob davis rbd thor ece uc edu

phillies a new ballpark in future attn those who live inthe philadelphia metro area back in september i was listening to wip and i remember the morning guys were talking with mayor ed rendell the topic of conversation was a new ball park for the phillies the location for this new park was suggested to be near th st station at the time the mayor was optimisitic that in the future this could become a reality has there been any new news on this subject or is it still a pipe dream i know the city of philadelphia has other projects ahead such as the new convention center and the upcoming spectrum ii but it would be nice to see this a reality it is planned that the phillies leave the vet and leave it solely to the eagles and if that s the case the eagles should make the vet a grass stadium but that s another story i want to see that day comments
re dave kingman for the hall of fame in article apr news yale edu steve tomassi writes hi baseball fans so what do you say don t you think he deserves it i mean heck if dave winfield ho hum is seriously being considered for it as is lee smith ha then why don t we give dave kingman a chance or darrell evans yeah yeah after the hall of fame takes in them it can take in eddie murray and jeff reardon i am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling or perceptions and i can not without having stats to back up my points however i think you approached this the wrong way i believe all of the people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than dave kingman does i feel they were all much better players i am not saying i fell they deserve to go but that they would deserve it more imho dave kingman definately not they guy only had a couple of years were he could hit with atleast a respectable averag the rest of his career i do not think he was very feared by pitchers i also do not think he did a lot for the game i mean really i am a met fan he was a met for part of his career and i still would not back him for the hall of fame dave winfield i think so he is feared by pitchers he has had several season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are in my opinion without stats better than kingman s probably by quite a bit i also perceive him to be a leader maybe not as much as some other people but none the less a leader i think he has made substantial contributions to the game of baseball and to society examples of this are some of the charitable things he has done i know some of this from when he was with the yankees i think he the type of player that kids can look up to and while this is definately not the only criteria for the hall of fame i think it deserves some consideration lee smith maybe i would have to see his stats again but he definately would deserve to go before the likes of kingman darrell evans no eddie murray maybe he has had a very good career he is a leader although a silent one he is a good role model are the stats good enough i am not sure but i would once again believe they are much better than kingman s both the average as well as the power numbers but not as good as winfield s just think eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years jeff reardon my guess is no but it kind of depends on his numbers off the top of my head i would take lee smith first well in any case i am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody giving hall of fame consideration to players that are by today s standards marginal honestly ozzie smith and robin yount don t belong there they re both shortstops that just hung around for a long time big deal well i strongly disagree here both of these guys deserve it for sure i talked about leadership above both of these guys are leaders and have been instumental in leading their teams to the post season robin does have very good offensive numbers both average and power and ozzie has okay numbers offensively the difference with ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop he would have shattered aaron s home run mark by now how many of those great plays saved games how many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a game while i believe both of these guys have numbers baseball is about more than numbers or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the hall of fame as does george brett who also belongs in this class of player let s be a little more selective huh stop handing out these honors so liberally save them for the guys who really deserve it face it if something isn t done there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore when certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential candidates the absurdity is apparent gee can these guys even compare to the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan steve garvey i am not sure probably not but i guess i could see someone making a case for him jack morris once again not my first choice but i can see why someone might bring up his name kirby puckett probably the only reason i do not say definately is he still has time left in his career if he continues doing what he has been then my probably will turn into a definately nolan ryan is there really any doubt i think i heard something about him having some records maybe they were not all good i don t know i did not hear any of them just the number he has the numbers he has the contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model i would not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game probably not even top but he would be the first pitcher i would put in the hall of fame because of his accomplishments no hitters strikeouts respectable numbers even with some weaker teams you can go on and on i really hope he gets all the possible votes so in summing up i have groups those that belong those that probably do but i am not sure and those that i lean towards saying don t belong at least not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go yes winfield yount brett not in your mail o smith puckett and ryan maybe murray and l smith no reardon garvey morris evans and definately kingman as i said i do not have the stats around so i do not have numbers to back this up these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions mike q steve

re notes on jays vs indians series something else to consider alomar s h r splits were slg obp baerga s was and pretty clearly alomar got a huge boost from his home park not necessarily it could mean that or it could mean that he just hit a lot better at home than he did on the road see frank thomas home road splits in for an example i would guess that some of alomar s split is due to the skydome but most of it is probably due just to coincidence there s no way to be sure of course but the only hitters the skydome seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters and alomar is not a home run hitter i d say you could make a good for them being about equal right now t p rated baerga higher actually only because of t p s bogus fielding stats which rate alomar as the worst defensive second baseman in the league on a career basis i think t p s fielding stats may mean something but on a seasonal basis it comes up with ridiculous results like this alomar may not be the god of fielding the media says he is but he sure isn t the worst in baseball offensively t p rate alomar much higher last year regarding the a vs b argument i ll just say they re both very good players with different strengths and a bright future greg

darrrrrrrrryl the media is beating the incident at dodger stadium on wednesday to death but i haven t seen anything in rsb yet gerald perry of the cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run he stroked a line drive into the right field corner the ball cleared the three foot high fence and went into the crowd darryl racing over from right center got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence but he missed the ball a fan sitting in the front row wearing a mitt reached up and caught the ball home run now i ve seen the replay several times and i have concluded that darryl missed the ball and that the fan s glove was essentially behind darryl s several dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with strawberry what cannot be disputed however is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing he was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch that exuberance disappeared immediately however when strawberry went into a tirade at the man all reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference and therefore of costing the dodgers a game shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch dodger stadium officials started to remove him from the park but then relented and just relocated him to another area in an interview after the game lasorda blamed the fan for the loss strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don t care about winning l a times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch before each dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any that are in the field of play was the fan wrong should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference or was he human and just reacting by the way he is a season ticket holder and on his request the dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the stadium where future interference is impossible others have questioned why darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of rbi through the first nine games i question what he was doing in right center with a left handed pull hitter up and the game on the line had he been closer to the play he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball but i guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan the beastmaster mark singer mss netcom com
gross grosses out dodger fans again went to the dodgers game tonight it was cap night astacio pitched ok but had control trouble all night in the first he walked a batter balked him to second then a single scored the run with the batter taking second on the throw home another single made the score cards lasorda tried a new line up featuring butler reed and piazza batting third darryl and eric were benched in favor of snyder and webster piazza homered in the first to make the score cards the dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single by offerman by the fourth inning astacio had already made about pitches but the score was still the dodger defense made several impressive plays piazza looked great behind the plate gunning down a runner trying to steal second throwing a runner out at first who had strayed a bit from first base etc karros also made a spectacular play keeping a ball from going into the outfield the runner on first was so sure that ball was going through he just kept running past second karros got up and threw to third and easily got the runner at third my heart sank in the th when gross got up to warm up in the bullpen astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter and when gross entered the game with the score still dodger fans just knew it was over gross was relieving because he stunk on tuesday pitching just innings forcing lasorda to use much of his bullpen the inning game had the same effect the next night so only gross was fresh given his light work out tuesday gross lived up to his name he walked the first batter gave up a hit to the second and walked the bases loaded after a grounder resulted in a force at home zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it cards gross paid little attention to the runners and the next thing you knew the cards had stolen a fourth run the runner on first was eventually tagged out in the run down but the th run had scored long before that meanwhile the dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning lee smith pitched the ninth he had little trouble getting karros and wallach does anyone have trouble with wallach these days cory snyder collected his first hit as a dodger a single but that was all the offense the dodgers could mount smith got his third straight save against the dodgers and all i got was my free dodger cap and a good look at piazza if piazza keeps this up all year he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year honors though its really early karros is already showing signs of a sophomore jinx year the final score cardinals runs on hits dodgers runs on hits dodger

break but bear with me in the bigs especially when they haven t even played aaa ball we certainly believe this kid is going to be very good some day but there is really no need to rush him especially since we have a mega million dollar staff that is probably well served by a battery mate who is expereienced in game calling and pitcher handling lopez time will come let s give him some time in aaa javy lopez has proven over ab in the minor leagues that he is ready to play in the majors he is not being rushed players who are clearly too good for aa and play behind stiffs at the major league level are wasting their time and may actually have a court case against major league management for keeping them at aaa no maybe i need to improve my writing skills lopez who is very ordinary defensively is not likely to hit so well at age unless lopez is me defensively i m and born to play second base he belongs in the major leagues training what does he have to do to earn a chance maybe not a full time job but at least a couple starts and a few ab for him to prove his worth gee i don t know abs sounds pretty good to me about as good as your reasoning that the kid should play a back up role rather than start every day at aaa talk about me as a gm valentine isn t saying he should back up he s saying he should be put in a position to win the job in the major leagues which imho he would if given the opportunity val if i m misinterpreting please let me know so far you have come up with two arguments against lopez he is very ordinary defensively he is young and most players suck when they are young the first is irrelevant he s trying to make the majors with his bat and the second involves seriously warped reasoning valentine ok most players are not ready for the bigs at age see current related posting on clayton one of my favorites most players benefit rather than being stagnant or hurt by playing at aaa most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their clubs in the bigs those are the arguments against lopez for the braves for this year but the players who are ready are the best and the ones most likely to benefit from being in the majors javy lopez is not a middle of the road prospect he s the real thing now again the most important thing a player can do is hit lopez does that miles better than olson or berryhill if his defense is good enough for greenville or richmond it s good enough for atlanta if he really was awful defensively he would no longer be a catcher see sprague ed now the braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid abilities to call games to work with the pitchers to throw out runners not superstars mind you but solid experienced veterans the braves have a very solid lineup with two big bats in the outfield an excellent platoon at first a solid mvp candidate at third and one of the better hitting shortstops the center field platoon will probably hit however good lopez what they have to offset the differential in experience and defensive ability the kid will improve playing at aaa and he probably won t being a reserve with the big club oh where to start ok first of all solid good i want good players solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who really aren t very good at baseball think of it as twg without the caps it s a losing strategy to say we have solid guys we don t need to improve you used it four times in that paragraph btw same for experienced i might add though that greg olson and damon berryhill aren t exactly carter and fisk olson has played three years berryhill five although and were a wash the only difference imho between olson and valle is the supporting cast two big bats hrm i like justice but i find mr gant s trend disturbing call it one and a maybe the braves platoon is ok but neither player has any value outside of the platoon bream vs lh and hunter vs rh are awful i ll leave the thirdbase comment alone pendleton has wasted too much bandwidth already if the cf platoon hits i ll retrace mr likhani s midnight run down forbes and i live in ny and la got that mike and doesn t cox call pitches anyway goodness do you believe the other poster who thinks lopez is being held down because of his future earning potential why on earth do you people thinkthe braves made this decision are they idiots who have built this ballclub jeeeesh

re hispanic all star team icop csa bu edu antonio pera writes hispanic magazine april had a couple of interesting articles about hispanic players including its hispanic all star team some of the major points are npr s morning edition aired a report this morning on hispanic latin american players in mlb and how they have many of the same problems faced by black negro african american players when they first entered the league however although baseball has adjusted to the presence of black players many hispanic players still labor under the stereotype of being fireballs hot blooded flashy the report also emphasised that despite the rantings my word of jessie jackson about baseballs discrimination against black players in its upper echelons baseball has actually done much better by black players than hispanic players another interesting point was the language barrier problem the reporter elaborated on an interview with ruben sierra which he gave in spanish to a spanish speaking newspaper reporter with the fact that there are maybe major baseball writers that speak spanish despite the fact that spanish is one of if not the easiest languages to learn so easy that the author cormac mccarthy learned spanish at age in order to research his book all the pretty horses yet few mlb organizations employ spanish speaking personel one of the exceptions being the oakland a s another point nearly of latin american players have some african blood yet most report that they d never really felt black until playing ball in the us ironically enough it is the early presence of latin american baseball players in the major leagues that support the idea that baseball was integrated before the arrival of jackie robinson as many light black or brown latin americans were incorporated into baseball s i did not know the cure for the disease of images but i believed in the healing sandra vigil power of words and stories vigil esca com until the end of the world
re braves giants in article news duke edu fls keynes econ duke edu forrest smith writes cox should ve protested the game the second time the garbage got thrown at his outfielders he should also have protested the game at the point where ron gant was assessed the second strike in the ninth on the grounds that he cox was on the field and time should have been called both protests would be denied of course the umpire s judgement determines the garbage thing although i think the game should be called but that s my personal opinion doesn t matter there is time only when the ump says so the second argument is baseless dave
re braves giants the situation with the giants bleachers is a case in point for the need for a commissioner this is true but the main thing the commish i e selig needs to do is to suspend bobby cox you cannot allow a team to come out at the ump as the braves did i usually rip umps but in this case the players were dead wrong cox should go for games if i had ever umped a game where that happened i d have ejected every player that came out only cox and gant would have been spared and then cox would have gone in the ensuing argument dave

re jack morris maynard ramsey cs laurentian ca roger maynard writes it sure does and it all depends on the definition that you use for better yours is based on what could have been and mine is based on what really happened well actually most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is based on some fantasy of how it happened but that s ok i understand you have a hockey background stats like plus minus make rbi look good is it viola s fault that boston had no offense is it because of morris that the blue jays had such a strong offense don t tell me that morris has this magical ability to cause the offensive players to score more runs this is the perfect example of your problem you are isolating viola s contribution from the rest of the team s efforts you can only do this if you can say for sure what the team would have done without viola only then can you compare but you cannot know how the team would have done without viola your analysis is fallacious ok how about a straigh answer then here s a very simele question to which i m sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to please answer yes or no roger can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs al only please for anyone else following along it is a well known and demonstrable fact that a team s win loss record is closely related to the number of runs the team scores and the number the team allows it s not a definite hard and fast function but there is definitely a correlation in fact as a rule of thumb if teams a and b both score x runs and team a allows y runs for every runs fewer than y that team b allows it will win another game so for instance if we look at the toronto blue jays we find that they scored runs and allowed of which morris allowed all other things being equal if frank viola with his era had replaced jack morris for the innings morris threw plausible since viola threw for boston the red jays would have allowed about fewer runs or enough for more wins now that doesn t take into account that viola pitched half his innings in fenway which is a harder park to pitch in particularly for a lefthander than skydome so um roger unless you really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs his team scores could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this analysis clearly it would be foolhardy to claim that viola would necessarily have put up a if he had been on the jay last year but that is not the claim we look at what the actual performances were and evaluate viola s as better than morris in the sense that had morris performed as viola did his team would have been better off it takes an open mind to really truly understand what is happening out here in the real world guys this is true but not so open that your brain falls out mike jones aix high end development mjones donald aix kingston ibm com computer if you don t open that exit hatch this moment i shall zap straight off to your major data banks and reprogram you with a very large ax got that zaphod beeblebrox
