re is morality constant was re biblical rape my last response in this thread fell into a bit bucket and vanished though appearing locally i ll repost it since i always feel slighted when someone appears to ignore one of my postings in a conversational thread i don t want rob to think i m doing so since this is now dated however don t feel compelled to respond in article apr watson ibm com strom watson ibm com rob strom writes i was making two separate points both of which attack face value bible interpretation to judge the bible s value today you judge it based on the way it is used today that is what do commentators actually say what do rabbis teach etc i suspect you meant this in context of the jewish tradition you have been referring to one problem with a highly interpreted tradition like this is what happens when a schism occurs and over time certain large and influential branches of the heretical group come to favor exactly a face value interpretation to judge the bible s value when originally written you a read it in the context of its time not with today s assumptions and b compare it to the practices of surrounding people while the context of the time is important value judgments must ultimately be according to current understanding or at least to some base standard relative stability success of a society e g this is obviously true in comparing it to practices of surrounding people for instance according to the bible the surrounding people were immoral savages with repulsive and inhuman habits we need to look rather at what those peoples were really like for instance in what way is it better to worship a single god whose presence is symbolically strongest in a tent or temple over multiple gods some of whose presence is symbolically represented in a statue by the bible s own terms idolatry is inherently evil but i see no evidence that the followers of the various other religions of the area and time were particularly bad people relative to the people in the bible scissors and cloth now in the past our ancestors did cut cloth with scissors but they at least knew that their inhumane neighbors cut it with their bare teeth so this was a relatively enlightened step forward from their earlier barbarism and made the transition to modern civilized paper cutting that much easier sounds good but it presupposes teeth rending neighbors which i see no support for one can argue that post facto assertion of inhumane neighbors can be used to make moral points but that doesn t mean that the actual neighbors really were inhuman more to the point such dehumanization of the people across the river or over the mountain or even of a different people dwelling among us is all too common that complex and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic interpretations of that history is interesting but i still don t think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it to attack condemnation of the original history note that i m speaking of historical interpretation here for instance claiming that hammurabi s an eye for an eye was primitive brutal retribution while moses version was an enlightened benign fine because the tradition has since interpreted the phrase that way as of years ago or so they probably both meant the same thing to be sure i m arguing from a parochial perspective i belong to this tiny tribe which has struggled against overwhelming odds for survival as a distinct tribe and this book is the book of my tribe the book commands us to dedicate ourselves to study to improve the world and to set an example as a light to the nations we ve revered the book and i think we ve been successful as scientists as artists and musicians as leaders in important humanitarian causes it s hard for me to separate the success of my people from the virtue of our book you d have to argue that we d have done significantly better with a different book or with no book or that another tribe with a different book or with no book has done significantly better i don t belittle the accomplishments particularly the intellectual ones of the jewish people i have given up on trying to think by analogy since i don t know of any other tribe that is at all similar the closest i can think of are the romany but i don t know enough about them to make a meaningful comparison i think a tradition of reflective study of flexible rather than dogmatic interpretation is a good thing i think that with such an attitude a case could be made that you could have done as well starting with a captain america comic or whatever the babylonian equivalent would have been jim perry perry dsinc com decision support inc matthews nc these are my opinions for a nominal fee they can be yours jim perry perry dsinc com decision support inc matthews nc these are my opinions for a nominal fee they can be yours
re satanic verses once again this posting has been delayed for about a week by falling between some software cracks in article bu edu jaeger buphy bu edu gregg jaeger writes as promised here is rafiq zakaria s discussion of the nature of the so called satanic verses from which rushdie s title has been taken rafiq zakaria muhammad and the quran penguin here follows an introduction to the controversial incident and an apologetic explanation purporting to show why it couldn t actually have happened the historicity of the episode doesn t matter to what follows i don t know whether i m quoting gregg or zakaria below anyway back to current affairs rushdie has by his own admission drawn on the version given by the orientalist watt among others this incident is not something rushdie or watt or anyone else dug up from nowhere it is a well known story a myth if you will known according to umar khan to every muslim school boy and girl and so presumably to rushdie and to gibreel farishta and then allowed his imagination to run wild yes this is what writing fiction is all about rushdie was writing about a crisis of faith and chose this myth to present it by placing the actor gibreel in the role of the angel whose name he took rushdie was not writing a history or theology book and nowhere claims or implies that this is what actually happened it s somewhat like stories woven around the relationship between jesus and the reformed prostitute mary magdalene another myth or those referring to the arthurian mythos or the grail legend or the wandering jew or dozens of others if you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer consider salman rushdie s children s book haroun and the sea of stories for an idea of the way a storyteller a specific storyteller works with existing story lines to ridicule muhammad s integrity no muhammad s mahound s integrity is not really impugned in this part of the story and there s no reason to think this was rushdie s intent gibreel as the archangel produces the verses divine and satanic though he doesn t know their provenance it is not implied in a straight reading that muhammad influences them not my voice i d never know such words i m no classy speaker never was never will be but this isn t my voice it s a voice mahound s eyes open wide he s seeing some kind of vision staring at it oh that s right gibreel remembers me he s seeing me my lips moving being moved by what whom don t know can t say nevertheless here they are coming out of my mouth up my throat past my teeth the words being god s postman is no fun yaar butbutbut god isn t in this picture god knows whose postman i ve been it s ambiguous is mahound somehow manipulating gibreel is it satan or something else the answer is not given to be sure the question is raised this novel explores faith and the role of revelation in religion among other things addressing loss of faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation but this novel proposes no answers at least not directly the very existence of a newsgroup named alt atheism raises the same questions more forcefully and does propose some answers which is the real relevance if rushdie s mild fictional exploration is filth and lies and he asked for what he got are we next on the fatwa list that s a rhetorical question of course jim perry perry dsinc com decision support inc matthews nc these are my opinions for a nominal fee they can be yours jim perry perry dsinc com decision support inc matthews nc these are my opinions for a nominal fee they can be yours
re who says the apostles were tortured another article that fell between the cracks in article qiu innpq srvr engin umich edu ingles engin umich edu ray ingles writes as evidence for the resurrection it is often claimed that the disciples were tortured to death for their beliefs and still did not renounce their claim that jesus had come back from the dead now i skimmed acts and such and i found a reference to this happening to stephen but no others where does this apparently very widely held belief come from is there any evidence outside the bible is there any evidence in the bible i sure haven t found any briefly no there is widespread folklore but no good documentary evidence or even solid rumor concerning the deaths of the apostles further the usual context of such arguments as you observe is no martyrs for a lie i e the willingness of these people to die rather than recant is evidence for the truth of their belief this adds the quite stronger twist that the proposed martyrs must have been offered the chance of life by recanting since we don t even know how or where they died we certainly don t have this information by the way even in the case of stephen it is not at all clear that he could have saved himself by recanting the willingness of true believers to die for their belief be it in jesus or jim jones is well documented so martyrdom in and of itself says little see kings for a biblical account of the martyrdom of priests of baal jim perry perry dsinc com decision support inc matthews nc these are my opinions for a nominal fee they can be yours
re who has read rushdie s the satanic verses another one rescued from the bit bucket over the years the furor over this book has been discussed on a a and elsewhere on the net generally the discussion comes down to the contention on the one hand that tsv contains such blood libel against islam as to merit if not death than at least banning and probably some sort of punishment and on the other that rushdie particularly as a non muslim in a western country had every right to write and publish whatever he chose regardless of whether some muslims find it offensive without fear of persecution or death i am naturally inclined to the latter position but find myself in an interesting position because i think this is a fine book only incidentally concerned with islam and moreover i m damned if i can find anything malevolently offensive in it over the years when i have made this point various primarily muslim posters have responded saying that yes indeed they have read the book and had called it such things as filth and lies i would rank rushdie s book with hitler s mein kempf or worse and so on unfortunately these comments are usually generalities and attempts to follow up by requesting explanations for what specifically is so offensive have met either with stony silence more generalizations or inaccurate or out of context references to the book which lead me to believe that few of them have actually read it corrections and attempts to discuss the text in context have been ignored anyway since i seem to be the only one following this particular line of discussion i wonder how many of the rest of the readership have read this book what are your thoughts on it jim perry perry dsinc com decision support inc matthews nc these are my opinions for a nominal fee they can be yours jim perry perry dsinc com decision support inc matthews nc these are my opinions for a nominal fee they can be yours
re is morality constant was re biblical rape this response originally fell into a bit bucket i m reposting it just so bill doesn t think i m ignoring him in article c w pv jxd darkside osrhe uoknor edu bil okcforum osrhe edu bill conner writes jim perry perry dsinc com wrote some stuff about biblical morality though bill s quote of me had little to do with what he goes on to say bill i m sorry to have been busy lately and only just be getting around to this apparently you have some fundamental confusions about atheism i think many of these are well addressed in the famous faq your generalisms are then misplaced atheism needn t imply materialism or the lack of an absolute moral system however i do tend to materialism and don t believe in absolute morality so i ll answer your questions how then can an atheist judge value an atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does according to a personal understanding of morality that i don t believe in an absolute one doesn t mean that i don t have one i m just explicit as in the line of postings you followed up that when i express judgment on a moral issue i am basing my judgment on my own code rather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad my moral code is not particular different from that of others around me be they christians muslims or atheists so when i say that i object to genocide i m not expressing anything particularly out of line with what my society holds if your were to ask why i think morality exists and has the form it does my answer would be mechanistic to your taste that a moral code is a prerequisite for a functioning society and that humanity probably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of our ability to exist in large societies thereby achieving considerable survival advantages you d probably say that god just made the rules neither of us can convince the other but we share a common understanding about many moral issues you think you get it from your religion i think i get it and you get it from early childhood teaching that you don t like what god told people to do says nothing about god or god s commands it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with a pre existing thought set to form that reaction i think you ve been reading the wrong sort of comic books but in prying through the gobbledygook i basically agree with what you re saying i do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as god commanded the genocide of the canaanites is mechanistic but of course i think that s true of you as well my reaction has little to do with whether god exists or even with whether i think he does but if a god existed who commanded genocide i could not consider him good which is supposedly an attribute of god all of this being so you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values right wrong goood evil etc and cannot participate your opinion about the bible can have no weight whatsoever hmm yes i think some heavy faq reading would do you some good i have as much place discussing values etc as any other person in fact i can actually accomplish something in such a discussion by framing the questions in terms of reason for instance it is clear that in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attempt to wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands then the quality of life will be generally poor so a system that fosters coexistence is superior if quality of life is an agreed goal an absolutist on the other hand can only thump those portions of a bible they happen to agree with and say this is good even if the act in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in the discussion the attempt to define someone or a group of people as excluded from discussion such that they cannot participate and their opinions given no weight whatsoever is the lowest form or reasoning ad hominem poisoning the well and presumably the resort of someone who can t rationally defend their own ideas of right wrong and the bible jim perry perry dsinc com decision support inc matthews nc these are my opinions for a nominal fee they can be yours jim perry perry dsinc com decision support inc matthews nc these are my opinions for a nominal fee they can be yours

re christian morality is dan schaertel dps nasa kodak com wrote since this is alt atheism i hope you don t mind if we strongly disagree the fact is god could cause you to believe anything he wants you to but think about it for a minute would you rather have someone love you because you made them love you or because they wanted to love you the responsibility is on you to love god and take a step toward him he promises to be there for you but you have to look for yourself indeed knock and it shall be opened to you dan why didn t this work i firmly believed in god for years but i eventually realised i was only deluding myself fearful to face the truth ultimately the only reason what kept me believing was the fear of hell the mental states i had sillily attributed to divine forces or devil s attempts to destroy my faith were nothing more than my imagination and it is easy to achieve the same mental states at will my faith was just learned fear in a disguise those who doubt this or dispute it have not givin it a sincere effort god is demanding too much dan what was it i believed in for years if sincere effort is equivalent to active suspension of disbelief what it was in my case i d rather quit if god does not help me to keep the faith i can t go on besides i am concerned with god s morality and mental health does she really want us to believe in herself without any help revelations guidance or anything i can feel if she has created us why didn t she make the task any easier why are we supposed to love someone who refuses to communicate with us what is the point of eternal torture for those who can t believe i love god just as much as she loves me if she wants to seduce me she ll know what to do simple logic arguments are folly if you read the bible you will see that jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with logic our ability to reason is just a spec of creation yet some think it is the ultimate if you rely simply on your reason then you will never know more than you do now your argument is of the type you ll know once you try yet there are many atheists who have sincerely tried and believed for many years but were eventually honest enough to admit that they had lived in a virtual reality what else but reason i can use i don t have the spiritual means christians often refer to my conscience disagrees with the bible i don t even believe i have a soul i am fully dependent on my body indeed i am this body when it goes up with flames so does my identity god can entertain herself with copies of me if she wants to learn you must accept that which you don t know what does this mean to learn you must accept that you don t know something right o but to learn you must accept something i don t know why this is not the way i prefer to learn it is unwise to merely swallow everything you read suppose i write a book telling how the great invisible pink unicorn tm has helped me in my daily problems would you accept this since you can t know whether it is true or not note that the gipu is also omnipotent omnipresent and loves just about everyone besides he and she is guiding every writer on this planet you and me and not just some people who write legendary stories years ago your god is just one aspect of his and her presence petri petri pihko kem pmp mathematics is the truth pihatie c finou oulu fi physics is the rule of sf oulu kempmp the game finland phoenix oulu fi chemistry is the game

re faith and dogma in article apr edt neat cs toronto edu tgk cs toronto edu todd kelley writes in light of what happened in waco i need to get something of my chest sadly understandable faith and dogma are dangerous yes religion inherently encourages the implementation of faith and dogma and for that reason i scorn religion to be fair you should really qualify this as semitic western religions but you basically go ahead and do this later on anyway i have expressed this notion in the past some christians debated with me whether christianity leaves any room for reasoning i claimed rationality is quelled out of christianity by faith and dogma again this should really be evaluated at a personal level for example there was only one jesus presumably and he probably didn t say all that many things and yet seemingly billions and billions of christian sects have arisen perhaps there is one that is totally dedicated to rationalism and believes in christ as in pantheism it would seem to go against the bible but it is amazing what people come up with under the guise of personal interpretation a philosopher cannot be a christian because a philosopher can change his mind whereas a christian cannot due to the nature of faith and dogma present in any religion this is a good point we have here the quintessential christian he sets up a system of values beliefs for himself which work very well and every event experience is understandable and deablable within the framework of this system however we also have an individual who has the inability at least not without some difficulty to change which is important because the problem with such a system is the same as with any system one cannot be open minded to the point of testing hypotheses against the basic premise of the system without destroying whatever faith is invested therein unless of course all the tests fail in other words the fairer way would be to test and evaluate moralities without the bias responsibility of losing retaining a system i claimed that a christian philosopher is not a christian but is a person whose beliefs at the moment correspond with those of christianity consider that a person visiting or guarding a prison is not a prisoner unless you define a prisoner simply to be someone in a prison can we define a prisoner to be someone who at the moment is in a prison can we define a christian to be someone who at the moment has christian beliefs no because if a person is free to go he is not a prisoner similarly if a person is not constrained by faith and dogma he is not a christian interesting but again when it seems to basically boil down to individual nuances although not always i will admit and probably it is the mass oriented divisions which are the most appalling it becomes irrelevant unfortunately i admit it s a word game i m going by the dictionary definition of religion religion n concern over what exists beyond the visible world differentiated from philosophy in that it operates through faith or intuition rather than reason webster s now let s go beyond the word game i don t claim that religion causes genocide i think that if all humans were atheist there would still be genocide there will always be humans who don t think there will always be humans who don t ask themselves what is the real difference between themselves and people with different colored skin or a different language or different beliefs granted religion is like the gun that doesn t kill anybody religion encourages faith and dogma and although it doesn t directly condemn people it encourages the use of just because thinking it is just because thinking that kills people in which case the people become the bullets and the religion as the gun merely offers them a way to more adequately do some harm with themselves if i may be so bold as to extend your similie sure religion has many good qualities it encourages benevolence and philanthropy ok so take out only the bad things like faith dogma and tradition put in the good things like careful reasoning and science the result is secular humanism wouldn t it be nice if everyone were a secular humanist to please the supernaturalists you might even leave god in there but the secular emphasis would cause the supernaturalists to start thinking and they too would realize that a belief in a god really doesn t put anyone further ahead in understanding the universe ok i m just poking fun at the supernaturalists also understandable of course not all humans are capable of thought and we d still have genocide and maybe even some mass suicide but not as much i m willing to bet on that todd todd kelley tgk cs toronto edu department of computer science university of toronto best regards adam john cooper verily often have i laughed at the weaklings who thought themselves good simply because acooper macalstr edu they had no claws

re who says the apostles were tortured the willingness of true believers to die for their belief be it in jesus or jim jones is well documented so martyrdom in and of itself says little it does say something about the depth of their belief religion has both deluded believers and con men the difference is often how far they will follow their beliefs i have no first hand or even second hand knowledge of how the original apostles died if they began a myth in hopes of exploiting it for profit and followed that myth to the death that would be inconsistent real con men would bail out when it was obvious it would lead to discomfort pain and death the story in kings regarding the prophets of baal is of no help in this debate one can easily assume that they believed that no overwhelming vindication of elijah would be forthcoming he was simply a fool who would be shown to be so the fire from heaven was swift and their seizure and deaths were equally swift

re societally acceptable behavior in article c qgm dl news cso uiuc edu cobb alexia lis uiuc edu mike cobb writes from cobb alexia lis uiuc edu mike cobb subject societally acceptable behavior date mon apr gmt merely a question for the basis of morality moral ethical behavior societally acceptable behavior who is society how do they define what is acceptable how do we keep from a whatever is legal is what is moral position mac wow you got me thinking now this is an interesting question in that recently there has been a move in society to classify previously socially unacceptable yet legal activities as ok in the past it seems to me there were always two coexisting methods of social control first and most explicit is legal control that is the set of actions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set of punishments secondly and somewhat more hidden is social control these are the actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered by legal control are scrictly controled by social censure ideally if socialization is working as it should legal control is hardly ever needed since most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of social censure the control manifests itself in day to day life as guilt and morality i ve heard it said and fully believe that if it weren t for the vast majority of people policing themselves legal control would be absolutely impossible lately last years however there has been a move to attempt to dissengage the individual from societal control ie if it ain t illegal then don t pick on me i m not saying this is wrong merely that it is a byproduct of a society which has a high education level a high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media a high level of institutionalized individual rights and a me oriented culture i guess what i m saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition here in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can can t allow people to do based entirely on personal squeamishness yet we are fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as those freedoms don t impinge on another s imho society is trying to persue two mutually exclusive ends here while we appreciate and persue individual rights these satisfy the old territoriality and dominance instincts the removal of socialized inherent fears based on ignorance will result in the continued destabilization of society i got no quick fix i have no idea how we can get ourselves out of this mess i know i would never consent to the roll back of personal freedoms in order to stabilize society yet i believe development of societies follow a darwinian process which selects for stability can we find a social model which maximizes indiv freed s yet is stable perhaps it is possible to live with a non stable society anybody see a way out comments ps therefore answer to question we don t do we want to phil trodwell this space i d be happy to ram a goddam volt cattle for rent prod into that tub with you right now but not cheap this radio hunter s thompson

re after years can we say that christian morality is reply to frank d s uucp frank o dwyer the problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be established if we accept that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to what ought to be see naturalistic fallacy then they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world this can be avoided in at least two ways by leaving the good undefined since anyone who claims that they do not know what it is is either lying or so out of touch with humanity as to be undeserving of a reply if the good is undefined undefinable but you require of everyone that they know innately what is right you are back to subjectivism by defining the good solely in terms of evaluative terms ditto here an evaluative statement implies a value judgement on the part of the person making it at this point the objectivist may talk of self evident truths pretty perceptive that prof flew but can he deny the subjectivist s claim that self evidence is in the mind of the beholder of course by denying that subject object is true dichotomy please explain how this helps i don t see your argument if not what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true if nothing then no moral judgements are true this is a thing that is commonly referred to as nihilism it entails that science is of no value irrepective of the fact that some people find it useful how anyone arrives at relativism subjectivism from this argument beats me this makes no sense either flew is arguing that this is where the objectivist winds up not the subjectivist furthermore the nihilists believed in nothing except science materialism revolution and the people the subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself to hold a moral opinion is he suggests not to know something to be true but to have preferences regarding human activity and if those preferences should include terrorism that moral opinion is not true likewise if the preferences should include noterrorism that moral opinion is not true why should one choose a set of preferences which include terrorisim over one which includes noterrorism oh no reason this is patently absurd and also not the position of the subjectivist as has been pointed out to you already by others ditch the strawman already and see my reply to mike cobb s root message in the thread societal basis for morality david nye nyeda cnsvax uwec edu midelfort clinic eau claire wi this is patently absurd but whoever wishes to become a philosopher must learn not to be frightened by absurdities bertrand russell

re yet more rushdie re islamic law in article apr monu cc monash edu au darice yoyo cc monash edu au fred rice wrote stuff deleted now i do not believe in blindly following anyone no matter how knowledgeable he or she may be in islamic law if someone tells me islam says such and such i immediately say show me the support for this statement from the qur an and sunnah i believe this to be my islamic duty for according to one hadith of the prophet peace and blessings of god be with him if your leader tells you to enter a fire and you do it and kill yourself then you have sinned for doing wrong even though you were blindly following the instructions of your leader i am responsible for my own actions not abu hanifa or imam malik etc even if i am blindly following the opinions of abu hanifa etc with this in mind to my understanding we must look at the reasoning behind such opinions of muslims that support khomeini s fatwa now to my understanding the hadith upon which those who support khomeini s fatwa is relating to a particular instance that occurred during war time now brother in general it is imho ridiculous and wrong to say that a hadith relating to the actions of war is usable during times of peace i think any sensible human being can see this so i personally think that the reasoning of some of our ulema in this matter is faulty for they think it is legitimate to use acts of war in times of peace regarding this particular subject if you think i am wrong please feel free to say so with your reasoning from qur an and hadith please not because somebody said so i want the reasoning from al qur an and the sahih hadiths perhaps we should take our discussion to soc religion islam please email me rashid if you think we should do this by the way i also disagree with your opinion regarding the punishment for apostasy the viewpoint i follow that there is in general no punishment for apostasy is very strongly supported by qur an and hadith this is very well shown in the book punishment in islamic law by mohamed s el awa american trust publications i reiterate that i would agree with you that there is little justification for the punishment of apostasy in the qur an in islamic history as well apostasy has rarely been punished belief is considered a matter of conscience and since there is to be no compulsion in the matter of belief apostates have been generally left to believe or not believe as they will however when an apostate makes attacks upon god and his messenger the situation changes now the charge of apostasy may be complicated with other charges perhaps charges of sedition treason spying etc if the person makes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public attacks as opposed to arguement against islam the situation is likewise complicated if the person spreads slander or broadcasts falsehoods again the situation changes the punishments vary according to the situation the apostate is in anyhow the charge of aggravated apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in rushdie s case there is a distinction in the qur an between a formal war situation and being in the situation where someone unilaterally wages war by their actions creates disorder makes mischief etc against the muslims and creates a situation that results in harm to muslims here a small group or even a single individual could be said to be engaged in such a practise in other words there is a clear difference between a formal war situation where two clearly defined parties wage war conclude treaties exchange prisoners etc and dealing with attacks that come from isolated individuals or groups against islam it is the second situation the unilateral attack and the spreading of fasad that would apply in the case of rushdie the matter of rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an offensive book banning the book is secondary a full set of circumstances following the publication of the book come into play as well including the deaths of many muslims and rushdie s and his publishers media games now i do not believe in blindly following anyone no matter how knowledgeable he or she may be in islamic law if someone tells me islam says such and such i immediately say show me the support for this statement from the qur an and sunnah i believe this to be my islamic duty for according to one hadith of the prophet peace and blessings of god be with him if your leader tells you to enter a fire and you do it and kill yourself then you have sinned for doing wrong even though you were blindly following the instructions of your leader i am responsible for my own actions not abu hanifa or imam malik etc even if i am blindly following the opinions of abu hanifa etc now to my understanding the hadith upon which those who support khomeini s fatwa is relating to a particular instance that occurred during war time now brother in general it is imho ridiculous and wrong to say that a hadith relating to the actions of war is usable during times of peace i think any sensible human being can see this so i personally think that the reasoning of some of our ulema in this matter is faulty for they think it is legitimate to use acts of war in times of peace regarding this particular subject i am not sure which hadith you are referring to above i believe that one of the qur anic verses on which the fatwa is based is every verse in the qur an has a corresponding circumstance of revelation but in no way is the understanding the tafsir of the verse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance in which it was revealed if this was the case then we could say that all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the muslims were not involved in conflict should be suspended when they were at war the logic does not follow in complex real life situations there may be many verses and many hadiths which can all be related to a single complicated situation the internal relationships between these verses may be quite complex such that arriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how each applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task it is not necessarily a simple this or that process there may be many parameters involved there may be a larger context in which a particular situation should be viewed all these matters impinge on the situation in other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the qur an the qur an asks us to reflect on its verses but this reflection must entail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith if the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety then each person has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that however if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to the state to the gestation of laws and rulings to the gestation of society the dispensing of justice the guidance of the community then there are certain minimum requirements of understanding that one should achieve jaffar ibn muhammad as sadiq a s relates some of these requirements as taught by the prophet s a in a hadith he who does not distinguish in the book of allah the abrogating verse from the abrogated one and a specific one from a general one and a decisive from an ambiguous and does not differentiate between a permission and an obligation and does not recognize a verse of meccan period from a medinite one and does not know the circumstances of revelation and does not understand the technical words of the qur an whether simple or compound and does not comprehend the knowledge of decree and measure and is ignorant of advancing and delaying in its verses and does not distinguish the clear from the deep nor the manifest from the esoteric nor the beginning from the termination and is unaware of the question and the answer the disjoining and the joining and the exceptions and the all inclusive and is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the subsequent one and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the detailed one the obligatory laws and the permissions the places of the duties and rules and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful and does not know the joined words and the words that are related to those coming before them or after them then such a man does not know the qur an nor is he among the people of the qur an based on these and other hadiths and in accordance with many qur anic verses why should not a company from every group remain behind to gain profound understanding tafaqquh in religion and to warn people when they return to them so that they may beware a science of jurisprudence arose the requirements for a person to be considered a mujtahid one who can pronounce on matters of law and religion are many i ve listed a few major divisions below there are of course many subdivisions within these headings knowledge of arabic syntax conjugation roots semantics oratory knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir logic mantiq a knowledge of hadiths a knowledge of transmitters rijal knowledge of the principles of juriprudence qur an sunnah consensus reasoning the study of qur an and sunnah for purposes of law involves discussion of imperatives awamir discussion of negative imperatives nawahi discussion of generalities and particularities aam wa khas discussion of unconditional and conditional discussion of tacit meanings discussion of the abstract and the clear discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated the principles of application of the law involves principles of exemption principles of precaution principles of option principles of mastery the jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process in pronouncing judgement on a given situation it is not a matter of looking at one verse and one hadith now no one should blindly follow anyone but there is a difference between blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is clearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself there is the famous hadith of the prophet s a in which he says the fuqaha religious scholars are the trustees of the prophet as long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires pleasures and wealth of this world the prophet s a was asked o messenger of god how may we know if they so concern themselves he s a replied by seeing whether they follow the ruling power if they do that fear for your religion and shun them i do not yet know enough about the imams of the four sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies to them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them the prophet also refered to the fuqaha as the fortress of islam my only point is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into play a certain amount of expertise the specifics of this expertise is delineated in the qur an and hadith those who acquire this expertise are praised in both the qur an and hadith those who without the requisite knowledge pronounce on matters that affect society state and religion are cautioned the only reason i said anything at all about the rushdie affair in this group is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa that is apostasy was wrong when one discusses something they should at least base their discussion on fact secondly khomeini was condemned as a heretic because he supposedly claimed to be infallible another instance of creating a straw man and then beating him perhaps we should take our discussion to soc religion islam please email me rashid if you think we should do this i agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup unfortunately i do not have any access to email so private discussion or a moderated group is out of the question i cannot post to a moderated group like soc religion islam how about soc culture arabic or talk religion misc as salaam a laikum
re yet more rushdie re islamic law in article bu edu jaeger buphy bu edu gregg jaeger wrote i have already made the clear claim that khomeini advocates views which are in contradition with the qur an and have given my arguments for this this is something that can be checked by anyone sufficiently interested khomeini being dead really can t respond but another poster who supports khomeini has responded with what is clearly obfuscationist sophistry this should be quite clear to atheists as they are less susceptible to religionist modes of obfuscationism don t mind my saying this but the best example of obfuscation is to condemn without having even your most basic facts straight if you want some examples go back and look at your previous posts where you manage to get your facts wrong about the fatwa and khomeini s supposed infallibility as salaam a laikum
re consciousness part ii kev strikes back kevin anthoney kax cs nott ac uk wrote about my reply diplomatic it a society that is constantly on the verge of flaming usenet diplomacy is the best way to ensure the voice of reason gets through isn t it i realize i m fighting occam s razor in this argument so i ll try to explain why i feel a mind is necessary kevin unfortunately you are now delving into field i know too little about algorithms your reasoning as i see it is very much along the lines of roger penrose who claimed that mathematical insight cannot be algorithmic in his book the emperor s new mind concerning computers minds and the laws of physics however penrose s claim that he has mathematical insight or your similar claim that wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look could be just illusions we are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints i try to ponder on the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective realising that it might not be anything special but certainly useful thinking back of what i wrote do you think worms have minds or not they are able to experience pain at least they behave just like that yet it is conceivable that we might some day in the future perform a total synthesis of c elegans from the elements would such a worm have a mind firstly i m not impressed with the ability of algorithms they re great at solving problems once the method has been worked out but not at working out the method itself this is true to some extent however i do not think that our brains work like computers at all in fact there is substantial evidence skarda skarda freeman that brains work more or less chaotically generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve our brains work much like genetic algorithm generators i suppose the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered does this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already pre programmed into our brains this is somewhat unlikely given that our brains ultimately are encoded in chromosomes worth of genetic material much of which isn t used indeed this is extremely unlikely given the vast impact of nurture on our mind and brain i suggest however that before trying to understand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms kevin take a look at the references i mentioned and think again i still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind are neurologists neuropsychologists and biologists but do not flame me for my opinions since they study beings that are conscious the reason i am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot lead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different and please do not bring qm into this discussion at all not all physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness plays some special role in physics i would say it doesn t the other problem with algorithms is their instability not many algorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code yet people survive strokes without going completely haywire there are side effects but patients still seem remarkably stable also neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate can an algorithm survive if i randomly corrupt various bits of it s code again brains are not computers don t forget this this does not mean they need something else to work they just work differently their primary purpose is perception and guidance of action self awareness and high intelligence are later appearances the next problem is the sticky question of what is colour replace colour with the sensation of your choice presumably the materialist viewpoint is that it s the product of some kind of chemical reaction the usual products of such a reaction are energy different chemicals is colour a mixture of these you are still expecting that we could find the idea of green in our brains somewhere perhaps in the form of some chemical this is not how i see it the sensation green is a certain time dependent pattern in the area v of our visual cortex and it is distributed with the help of areas v and v to the rest of the brain indeed a firing pattern i have sometimes thought of our consciousness as a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns but this is just idle speculation scientific american s september issue was a special issue on mind and brain have you already read it from cover to cover there are two articles on visual perception so you might be interested but again please note that subjective experiences cannot be observed from a third person perspective if we see nothing but neuronal activity we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the mind kalat writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation of different areas of brain have led to various changes in the patients state of mind for instance a patient whose septal area was stimulated without his knowledge by remote control during a psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression and started discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend stimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing situations when the patients have started flirting with the therapist in conclusion there is evidence that brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in various areas of brain when we think of colours our visual cortex is activated etc consciousness is an afterthought we become conscious of our actions with a half a second delay and our brains are ahead of our conscious will by at least ms thus i think it is fruitful to turn the question why do i see colours around and ask what is this i that seems to be observing since it seems that our conscious mind is not the king of our brains if this is so a computer won t see colour because the chemistry is different does an algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an equivalent that doesn t it shouldn t because the outputs of each algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances so why do we see colour this depends on what is meant by seeing colours does a neural network that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from to see the numbers if it is capable of sorting them if you are asking why does an animal who is conscious of itself as an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who doesn t i have a good answer read my previous posting where i wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swap roles and act more morally so that they don t unconsciously kill each other with newly discovered weapons a bit extreme but this is the basic idea when early homo became more and more efficient in using tools a sense of identity and the concept of self had to evolve in line with this development indeed respect for others and conscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages for social animals such as early humans if i remember correctly quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction with two processes acting on it the first process has been called unitary evolution or u is governed by schroedinger s equation and is well known the second process called various things such as collapse of the wavefunction or state vector reduction or r and is more mysterious it is usually said to occur when a measurement takes place although nobody seems to know precisely when that occurs when it does occur the effect of r is to abruptly change the wavefunction if minds are required for this does this mean that until human minds came to the scene wavefunctions never collapsed but remained in the superpositions for aeons my how powerful we are this has been discussed before and i think this topic is irrelevant since we do not agree that minds are necessary and neither do physicists anyway i m speculating that minds would be in part x there seems to be some link between consciousness and r in that we never see linear superpositions of anything although there are alternative explainations for this i ve no idea how a brain is supposed to access part x but since this is only speculation that won t matter too much my main point is that there might be a place for minds in physics i agree but not in the sense you apparently mean above physics needs sharp minds to solve many real problems i ll go back to my nice padded cell now if that s ok with you it s ok if you don t forget to take with you the references i wrote about in my previous posting plus the following

atheism survey i am doing research on atheism part of which involves field research here on the net the following is a survey directed towards all readers of this group intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief i would seriously appreciate it if each and every one of you would fill it out and mail it back to me at mtabbott unix amherst edu first of all i ve tried to structure questions that can be answered in a variety of ways with varying amounts of detail it s possible to give succinct answers to most everything but there s enough here to keep most of you typing for hours i m sure as much detail as you want to give me i mean it is great but it s also important for me to have as broad a base of individuals as possible so even minimal responses are far better than nothing it s a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration secondly i hope some of the questions don t come off as obnoxious i know that phrases like what would convince you of the existence of god imply that i am a seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant godless heathens in fact i m not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself so my use of god is a question of locution rather than ideology it s easier than just repeating a deity or higher power every time also i tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like belief system although i know some of you might contend that you don t have any beliefs but are skeptical towards everything i understand but you know what i mean think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases required to get the precise idea across lastly thanks please fill out as much as you can in as much detail as you can and send them to me my research and i thank you where would you place your beliefs on the spectrum theism agnosticism weak atheism strong atheism feel free to elaborate on your specific beliefs in what if any religious tradition were you raised did you ever believe in the existence of a god several of the following questions presume that the answer to this is yes if you ve always been an atheist or at least never a theist you may have to modify the question answer somewhat how serious was your your family s involvement how and when did you start to doubt the tenets you were raised to believe how and when did your final break with your beliefs if any occur i realize that this is often more of an ongoing process than an event per se whatever the case just describe it in whatever detail you wish what contact with other atheists have you had before and after and during your conversion to atheism certainly your involvement with alt atheism counts how have net discussions affected your beliefs to what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in your beliefs did you come by your beliefs through discussion through independent means or by some combination of the two or other means are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational means proofs of the non existence of god etc or was it perhaps at least in part through other means alienation from mainstream religion etc to what extent do you feel you understand the universe through your beliefs what phenomena of the universe and of human existence anything from physical phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs do you feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs and where are they lacking as an explanatory method what would it take for you to question or change your beliefs what would convince you of the existence of god what would convince you of the plausibility of god s existence and so forth how dynamic are your beliefs are they constantly changing have they stayed more or less the same for some time are you involved in a career or education in science to what extent do you think science has influenced your beliefs issac asimov claimed that science was the new secular religion and that scientists are in a very real sense the new priesthood do you see the pursuit of science as having a quasi religious base or even a religious element this survey is intended to get data from a broad range of individuals but also to help me narrow down the field to a small group of people whose ideas and histories could be very useful to me would you be willing to have me on the basis of this survey write you to find out more about you and your beliefs if not fine your filling out the survey alone is great thanks again feel free to contact me if you have any questions about what i m doing with this data or if you have anything to say in addition to what i ve asked about above mark abbott mtabbott unix amherst ed
re americans and evolution now with free ockham s razor inside sorry about the delay in responding due to conference paper deadline panic in article qsnqqinn nr senator bedfellow mit edu bobs thnext mit edu robert singleton writes in article apr dcs warwick ac uk simon dcs warwick ac uk simon clippingdale writes alarming amounts of agreement deleted i made my statement about ockums razor from my experiences in physics thanks for info in baysian statistics very interesting and i didn t know it before i follow your proof but i have one questions we have two hypotheses h and hg the latter is more complicated which by definition means p h p hg that complicated isn t in fact where p h p hg comes from it s more the other way around it s from p h p hg p hg where g is the complement of g and by axiom p anything so p hg so p h p hg in a sense hg is necessarily more complicated than h for any h and g so i may be splitting hairs but what i m trying to say is that irrespective of subjective impressions of how complicated something is p h p hg holds with equality if and only if p hg as you point out it s a very simple matter to show p x h p x hg p h x p hg x and thus h is to be preferd to hg now to say that h is as consistent with the data as hg is to say p x h p x hg can you elaborate some on this well p x a p x b means that x is as likely to be observed if a is operative as it is if b is operative this implies that observing x does not provide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between the respective possibilities that a and b are operative the difference reduces to the difference between the unknown and unhelpful prior probabilities p a and p b p x a p x b p a x k p a and p b x k p b where k p x a p x p x b p x so a and b are equally consistent with the data in that observing x doesn t give any pointers as to which of a or b is operative in the particular case where a h and b hg however we know that their prior probabilities are ordered by p h p hg although we don t know the actual values and it s this which allows us to deploy the razor to throw out any such hg also in the real world it isn t as clear cut and dry it seems to me we can t always determine whether the equality p x h p x hg is true that s certainly true but the particular point here was whether or not a divine component actually underlies the prevalence of religion in addition to the memetic transmission component which even the religious implicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of spreading the word now it seems to me as i ve said that the observed variance in religious belief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model but rather less well if one proposes a divine component in addition since i would expect the latter to conspire against wide variance and even mutual exclusion among beliefs thus my personal feeling is that p x hg isn t even equal to p x h in this case but is smaller h is memetic transmission g is divine component x is the variance among beliefs but i happily acknowledge that this is a subjective impression btw my beef with your baysian argument was not a mathematical one i checked most of your work and didn t find an error and you seem very careful so there probably isn t a math mistake i think the mistake is philosophical but just to make sure i understand you can please rephrase it in non technical terms i think this is a reasonable request i always try to look for ways of explaining physics to non physicist i m not a baysian statistician nor any type of statistician so this would be very helpful not that i m a statistician as such either but the idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of the read my observations to date however theism of the type with which i am concerned also suggests that for instance prayer may be answered people may be miraculously healed both are in principle amenable to statistical verification and that god s may generally intervene in measurable ways this means that these regions of the space of possible observations which i loosely termed appearances of god s have some nonzero probability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic since there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to scatter around over the observation space the probability which theism expends on making appearances of god s possible must come from somewhere else i e other possible observations all else being equal this means that an observation which isn t an appearance of god s must have a slightly higher probability under atheism than under theism the bayesian stuff implies that such observations must cause my running estimate for the probability of the atheistic hypothesis to increase with a corresponding decrease in my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis sorry if that s still a bit jargonesque but it s rather difficult to put it any other way since it does depend intimately on the properties of conditional probability densities and particularly that the total area under them is always unity an analogy may or may not be helpful say that hypothesis a is the coin is fair and that b is the coin is unfair two headed i ve used a and b to avoid confusion with h heads and t tails then p h a total p t a p h b total p t b the observations are a string of heads with no tails this is compatible with both a fair coin a and a two headed coin b however the probability expended by a on making possible the appearance of tails even though they don t actually appear must come from somewhere else since the total must be unity and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance of heads say our running estimates at time n are e n a and e n b the observation x n at time n is another head x n h the estimates are modified according to p h a e n a e n a e n a m p h and p h b e n b e n b e n b m p h now we don t know p h the actual prior probability of a head but the multiplier for e a is half that for e b this is true every time the coin is tossed and a head is observed thus whatever the initial values of the estimates after n heads we have n e n a m e a and n e n b m e b and since e k a e k b at any time k you can show that m and thus m hence the estimate for the fair coin hypothesis a must decrease at each trial and that for the two headed coin hypothesis b must increase even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads the loose analogy is between unfair coin and atheism and between fair coin and theism with observations consistent with both a tail which would falsify unfair coin is analogous to an appearance of god s which would falsify atheism i am not claiming that the analogy extends to the numerical values of the various probabilities just that the principle is the same constant observation of no evidence for gods if evidence for them is at all possible under the respective theisms constantly increases the notional estimated probability that they don t exist it s important to draw a distinction between theism that could be supported or not supported by evidence and theism that can t given a theism for which evidence is in principle not possible it doesn t make sense to say lack of evidence supports the contrary view quite so but this type of theism is what i might call the g in the hg in terms of our ockham s razor discussion and i d bin it on those grounds so it depends upon your conception of this god if it s a conception like zeus who happened to come down to earth to play quite frequently then i agree with you lack of evidence for this conception of god is evidence that it does not exist but if your conception of god is one that does not make falsifiable predictions see below on falsifiable predictions then i disagree lack of evidence does not support a disbelief the hypotheses don t have to be falsifiable and indeed in my model the theism isn t falsifiable i used the phrase should obverse given any specific x theism does not make the prediction p x ht that s why i used the word should theism makes no predictions about any specific event i can only say i believe that god did such and such after such and such happens or i believe god will do such and such but for any given x i can never a priori say p x ht i can not even say this for the set of all x or some x this is what don t like about your use of probability we also have no way of assigning these probabilities i hold science to positivistic criteria if someone cannot tell me how to measure even in principle p x h then probability is not applicable to hypothesis h such is the case when h ht theistic and ha atheistic for example p x ha p x ha p ha what is p ha how do i measure it you don t have to we don t need in the above analogy to know any prior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for the fair coin hypothesis is less than unity and that the corresponding multiplier for the two headed coin hypothesis is greater than unity you don t need to know the initial values of the running estimates either it s clear that after a large number of observations p fair coin approaches zero and p two headed coin approaches unity all you need to know is whether p x ha is larger than p x ht for observed x and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain events rendered possible not necessary under ht which are not possible under ha and all else is equal baysian statistics relies upon a series of observations but what if the hypothesis isn t amenable to observation and even for statements that are amenable to observation some observations are not relevant a sequence of observations must be chosen with care i m curious to know what types of observations x x you have in mind concerning theism and atheism any observations you like it really doesn t matter nor affect the reasoning provided that there are some possible observations which would count as appearances of god s examples of this might be a demonstration of the efficacy of prayer or of the veracity of revelation but any statement about p x h for general x still counts as a prediction of h if the theism in question ht says that prayer may be answered or that miracles may happen see my interpretation quoted again above of what god exists means then this is a prediction p x ht for such x it s what distinguishes it from the atheist hypothesis ha which predicts that this stuff does not happen p x ha for such x theism does not make the claim that p x ht for such x or i should say that my theism doesn t maybe i was too quick to say we had a common language you said that by the existence of god you mean the notion that the deity described by the bible and by christians does interact with the universe as claimed by those agents i agreed with this however i must be careful here i believe this i m not making any claims maybe i should have changed does to can there is an important shift of emphasis but any way since i only have a belief i cannot conclude p x ht for such x ok we ll downgrade does interact to may interact which would actually be better since does interact implies a falsifiability which we both agree is misplaced i don t think my theism makes predictions maybe i m not understanding what you mean by prediction could you explain what you mean by this word i ll explain but bear in mind that this isn t central all i require of a theism is that it not make the prediction appearances of god s will never happen as does atheism before somebody points out that quantum mechanics doesn t make this prediction either the difference is that qm and atheism do not form a partition predictions include such statements as prayer is efficacious implying if you do the stats you will find that prayer is efficacious or prayer is not efficacious or verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled i don t think we have any problems of misunderstanding here persistent observation of this stuff not happening consistent with ht though it may be is more consistent with ha as explained in the bayesian stats post even if ht god exists is unfalsifiable that s no problem for my argument other than that you have to let the number of observations go to infinity to falsify it asymptotically btw i do not consider an argument that requires an infinite number of observations as valid or rather that part of the argument is not valid we as existing humans can never make an infinite number of measurments and any conclusion that reilies on this i don t accept as valid that s fine i don t claim that theism is false merely that the finite number of observations available to me so far suggest that it is and that as i continue to observe the suggestion looks better and better renormalization stuff deleted in the bayesian stats post i assumed that theism was indeed unfalsifiable in a finite number of observations here s the relevant quote the important assumption is that there are some observations which are compatible with the theist hypothesis and not with the atheist hypothesis and thus would falsify atheism these are what i called appearances of god s but this need not be taken too literally any observation which requires for its explanation that one or more gods exist will count all other observations are assumed to be compatible with both hypotheses this leaves theism as unfalsifiable and atheism as falsifiable in a single observation only by such appearances of god s here is my problem with this for something to be falsifiable it must make the prediction that x should not be seen if x is seen then the hypothesis has been falsified now atheism is a word in oposition to something theism a theism aserts a belief and an atheism aserts a disbelief so there are certain atheisms that are certainly falsifiable just as there are certain theisms that are falsifable e g if my theism asserts the world is only years old and that god does not decieve then this has been falsified however the atheism that is in oposition to an unfalsifiable theism is also unfalsifiable i could be wrong on this statment contd i think you are an appearance of god s is sufficient to falsify atheism whereas in general the corresponding theism is unfalsifiable i ll think more about it until then here is a general question suppse x were unfalsifiable is not x also unfalsifiable no by way of a counterexample let x the coin is fair or more accurately so that not x makes sense the two sides of the coin are different this is unfalsifiable by tossing the coin even a string of heads is consistent with a fair coin and you have to go to an infinite number of tosses to falsify x in the limit its converse is falsifiable and is falsified when at least one head and at least one tail have appeared this is partly what s wrong with you baysian argument which requires observations x x n to be made there are simply no such observations that have a truth value in relation to the statement god exists now by use of your symmetry argument i can understand why someone would say since the statement god does not exist makes no predictions i will choose not to believe it but none the less this would be founded on a type of faith or if you don t like the word faith insert belief for which there is no falsifiable evidence instead i ll assume you meant god exists up there at the highlight but by our agreed definition of exists the statement makes predictions as i said above although it isn t falsifiable in a finite number of observations actually i mean god does not exist makes no predictions oops sorry mea culpa the truth of this statment actually depends upon which god you are refering to but i can think of some conceptions of god for which it is true but once again i m open to the posibility that i could be wrong so give me some examples of predictions of the statment god does not exist here is one that i can think of if true then there would be no healing or miricles but this can in principle never be determined one way or the other there are cases in which people seem to recover and are healed without the help of a doctor and for no known reason these situations do in fact happen they are consistent with a theistic hypothesis but in no way support such a hypothesis we agree here they are not inconsistent with an atheistic hypothesis i can t think of one prediction from god does not exist that isn t of this type but i might be missing something the rapture will not happen on october said rapture would have falsified atheism to my satisfaction had it happened although its failure to happen does not of course falsify any theisms other than those which specifically predicted it no phenomenon which requires the existence of one or more gods for its explanation will ever be observed that about sums the whole thing up bob singleton bobs thnext mit edu cheers simon

re theism and fanatism was islamic genocide in article r sn r horus ap mchp sni de frank d s uucp frank o dwyer writes theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in absolutes irrational belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with fanatism deletion theism is correlated with fanaticism i have neither said that all fanatism is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanatism the point is theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic one could of course argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism for example but i just have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it imo the influence of stalin or for that matter ayn rand invalidates your assumption that theism is the factor to be considered bogus i just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism the point is that theism is a factor gullibility blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on are all more reliable indicators and the really dangerous people the sources of fanaticism are often none of these things they are cynical manipulators of the gullible who know precisely what they are doing that s a claim you have to support please note that especially in the field of theism the leaders believe what they say now some brands of theism and more precisely some theists do tend to fanaticism i grant you to tar all theists with this brush is bigotry not a reasoned argument and it reads to me like a warm up for censorship and restriction of religious freedom ever read animal farm that s a straw man and as usually in discussions with you one has to repeat it read what i have written above not every theism leads to fanatism and not all fanatism is caused by theism the point is there is a correlation and it comes from innate features of theism gullibility by the way is one of them and to say that i am going to forbid religion is another of your straw men interesting that you have nothing better to offer define irrational belief e g is it rational to believe that reason is always useful irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason the latter has been discussed for a long time with charley wingate one point is that the beliefs violate reason often and another that a process that does not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information well there is a glaring paradox here an argument that reason is useful based on reason would be circular and argument not based on reason would be irrational which is it that s bogus self reference is not circular and since the evaluation of usefulness is possible within rational systems it is allowed your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics and mathematics are therfore circular the first part of the second statement contains no information because you don t say what the beliefs are if the beliefs are strong theism and or strong atheism then your statement is not in general true the second part of your sentence is patently false counterexample an axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis but is assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is used to obtain it i ve been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions of god here an axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here is a an often refuted fallacy have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice and further one can evaluate axioms in larger systems out of which they are usually derived i exist is derived if you want it that way further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms what is it you are trying to say compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational i can t agree with this until you are specific which theism to say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which i suspect you do not have using the traditonal definition of gods personal supernatural entities with objective effects on this world usually connected to morals and or the way the world works the affinity to fanatism is easily seen it has to be true because i believe it is nothing more than a work hypothesis however the beliefs say they are more than a work hypothesis i don t understand this can you formalise your argument person a believes system b becuase it sounds so nice that does not make b true it is at best a work hypothesis however the content of b is that it is true and that it is more than a work hypothesis testing or evaluating evidence for or against it therefore dismissed because b already believed says it is wrong a waste of time not possible depending on the further contents of b amalekites idolaters protestants are to be killed this can have interesting effects answer the question what the absolute set of morals is

re death penalty gulf war long jbrown batman bmd trw com writes i don t regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people but i do regret the circumstances which make those decisions necessary and i regret the suffering caused by those decisions i m afraid i m going to have to kill you don t worry though as a loving christian i guarantee that i will regret the fact that i have to kill you although i won t regret the actual killing if we hadn t intervened allowing hussein to keep kuwait then it would have been appeasement right but did you ever hear anyone advocate such a course of action or are you just setting up a strawman i m not setting up a strawman at all if you want to argue against the war then the only logical alternative was to allow hussein to keep kuwait false dichotomy diplomatic alternatives including sanctions were ineffective that s because they weren t even attempted but what about those who didn t support hitler s dreams of conquest it s not as if they democratically voted for all his policies the nsdap got in the elections of and that was the last chance the german people got to vote on the matter they suffered along with the rest why does this bother you so much you want to know why it bothers me that thousands of innocent people were maimed or killed by bombing at the end of ww when it was far from clear that such bombing was necessary the world is full of evil and circumstances are not perfect many innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others it it regretable but that s the way it is and why is it that way who set things up to be that way this was happening before the gulf war why didn t we send in the bombers to east timor why aren t we sending in the bombers now probably because we re not the saviors of the world we can t police each and every country that decides to self destruct or invade another no just the ones that have oil or the ones that look like they might make a success of communism nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to tibet east timor or some other places i don t see that getting un forces to east timor is any harder than getting them to iraq tibetan people are rounded up tortured and executed amnesty international recently reported that torture is still widespread in china why aren t we stopping them in fact why are we actively sucking up to them by trading freely with them tell me how we could stop them and i ll support it i for one do not agree with the present us policy of sucking up to them as you put it i agree that it is deplorable fine write to your congressman and to president clinton china s status as most favoured nation comes up for renewal in june point out that the us shouldn t be offering favourable trading terms to such a despicable regime i doubt anything will happen clinton s keener on trade sanctions against europe unbelievable comments about the rodney king case deleted the media is not totally monolithic even though there is a prevailing liberal bias programs such as the macneil lehrer news hour try to give a balanced and fair reporting of the news there are even conservative sources out there if you know where to look hurrah for rush any idea how many kill files you just ended up in i an atheist am arguing against killing innocent people you a supposed christian are arguing that it s ok to kill innocent people so long as you get some guilty ones as well hardly i didn t say that it s a good thing tm to kill innocent people if the end is just unfortunately we don t live in a perfect world and there are no perfect solutions if one is going to resist tyranny then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die i didn t say it is ok it is unfortunate but sometimes necessary the ends justify the means eh you having criticised moral relativism in the past are now arguing that i am in no position to judge the morality of allied actions at the end of the war you certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist the same tired old misunderstanding moral relativism means that there is no objective standard of morality it doesn t mean you can t judge other people s morals christ on a bike how many times have we tried to hammer that into your head where s your christian love where s your absolute morality oh how quick you are to discard them when it suits you as ivan stang would say jesus would puke one day i will stand before jesus and give account of every word and action even this discourse in this forum i understand the full ramifications of that and i am prepared to do so i don t believe that you can make the same claim obviously not as i am an atheist i don t think you d get on with jesus though he was a long haired lunatic peace nik was he not and btw the reason i brought up the blanket bombing in germany was because you were bemoaning the iraqi civilian casualties as being so deplorable yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasn t accurate enough to hit industrial military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time but in the gulf war precision bombing was the norm so the point was why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted in spite of precision bombing when so many more civilians proportionately and quantitatively died under the blanket bombing in ww right unfortunately for you it turned out that my opinions on the matter were entirely consistent in that i condemned the bombing of dresden too i think you re being a bit glib with your explanation of the blanket bombing policy too you make it sound as though we were aiming for military targets and could only get them by destroying civilian buildings next door as i understand it that is not the case we aimed deliberately at civilian targets in order to cause massive damage and inspire terror amongst the german people civilians suffer but less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history oh come on with wars like the falklands fresh in people s minds that sort of propaganda isn t going to fool anyone the stories of hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk yes bunk the us lost servicemen in ww over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting yes and what about the millions of casualties the russians suffered it s hardly surprising the us didn t lose many men in ww given that you turned up late mathew
re gulf war selling arms jbrown batman bmd trw com writes mathew i agree this it seems is the crux of your whole position isn t it that the us shouldn t have supported hussein and sold him arms to fight iran i agree and i agree in ruthlessly hunting down those who did or do but we did sell arms to hussein and it s a done deal now he invades kuwait so do we just sit back and say well we sold him all those arms i suppose he just wants to use them now too bad for kuwait no unfortunately sitting back and letting things be is not the way to correct a former mistake destroying hussein s military potential as we did was the right move but i agree with your statement reagan and bush made a grave error in judgment to sell arms to hussein but it s still happening that s the entire point only last month john major hailed it as a great victory that he had personally secured a sale of arms to saudi arabia the same month we sold jet fighters to the same indonesian government that s busy killing the east timorese it s all very well to say oops we made a boo boo better clean up the mistake but the us and uk keep making the same mistake they do it so often that i can t believe it s not deliberate this suspicion is reinforced by the fact that the mistake is an extremely profitable one for a decrepit economy reliant on arms sales so it s really not the gulf war you abhor so much it was the u s s and the west s shortsightedness in selling arms to hussein which ultimately made the war inevitable right no i thought both were terrible mathew

re theism and fanatism was islamic genocide in article bb d c i dbstu rz tu bs de i dbstu rz tu bs de benedikt rosenau writes in article r tqo ook horus ap mchp sni de frank d s uucp frank o dwyer writes theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in absolutes irrational belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with fanatism deletion theism is correlated with fanaticism i have neither said that all fanatism is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanatism the point is theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic one could of course argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism for example but i just have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it imo the influence of stalin or for that matter ayn rand invalidates your assumption that theism is the factor to be considered bogus i just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism the point is that theism is a factor that s your claim now back it up i consider your argument as useful as the following belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism therefore belief is a factor in fanaticism true and utterly useless note this is any belief not belief in gods tiring to say the least i have backed it up read the first statement i have read it conspicuous by its absence is any evidence or point the latter is the fallacy of the wrong analogy saying someone believes something is hardly an information about the person at all saying someone is a theist holds much more information further the correlation between theists and fanatism is higher than that between belief at all and fanatism because of the special features of theistic belief truth by blatant assertion evidence gullibility blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on are all more reliable indicators and the really dangerous people the sources of fanaticism are often none of these things they are cynical manipulators of the gullible who know precisely what they are doing that s a claim you have to support please note that especially in the field of theism the leaders believe what they say if you believe that you re incredibly naive you frank o dwyer are living in a dream world i wonder if there is any base of discussion left after such a statement as a matter of fact i think you are ignorant of human nature even when one starts with something one does not believe one gets easily fooled into actually believing what one says to give you the benefit of the doubt prove your statement the onus of proof is on you sunshine what makes you think that theist leaders believe what they say especially when they say one thing and do another or say one thing closely followed by its opposite the practice is not restricted to theism but it s there for anyone to see it s almost an epidemic in this country just for instance if it is harder for a camel to pass thru the eye of a needle why is the catholic church such a wealthy land owner why are there churches to the square inch in my country now some brands of theism and more precisely some theists do tend to fanaticism i grant you to tar all theists with this brush is bigotry not a reasoned argument and it reads to me like a warm up for censorship and restriction of religious freedom ever read animal farm that s a straw man and as usually in discussions with you one has to repeat it read what i have written above not every theism leads to fanatism and not all fanatism is caused by theism the point is there is a correlation and it comes from innate features of theism no some of it comes from features which some theism has in common with some fanaticism your last statement simply isn t implied by what you say before because you re trying to sneak in innate features of all theism the word you re groping for is some bogus again not all theism as is is fanatic however the rest already gives backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and theism and further the specialty of other theistic beliefs allows them to switch to fanatism easily it takes just a nifty improvement in the theology truth by blatant assertion gullibility by the way is one of them no shit sherlock so why not talk about gullibility instead of theism since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have as opposed to the case you are trying to make because there is more about theism that the attraction to gullible people causing the correlation and the whole discussion started that way by the statement that theism is meaningfully correlated to fanatism which you challenged indeed i did as i recall i asked for evidence what is the correlation of which you speak and to say that i am going to forbid religion is another of your straw men interesting that you have nothing better to offer i said it reads like a warm up to that that s because it s an irrational and bogus tirade and has no other use than creating a nice them us split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either side of church walls blah blah blah i am quite well aware that giving everyone their rights protects me better from fanatics than the other way round of course other people are always fanatics never oneself your wish to slur all theists seems pretty fanatical to me it is quite nice to see that you are actually implying a connection between that argument and the rise of fanatism so far it is just another of your assertions so you can do it define irrational belief e g is it rational to believe that reason is always useful irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason the latter has been discussed for a long time with charley wingate one point is that the beliefs violate reason often and another that a process that does not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information well there is a glaring paradox here an argument that reason is useful based on reason would be circular and argument not based on reason would be irrational which is it that s bogus self reference is not circular and since the evaluation of usefulness is possible within rational systems it is allowed o k it s oval it s still begging the question however and though that certainly is allowed it s not rational and you claiming to be rational and all another of your assertions no proof no evidence just claims hey i learned it from you did i do good at the risk of repeating myself and hearing we had that before we didn t hear a refutation before so we re back deal with it you can t use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful someone who thinks reason is crap won t buy it you see that is unusually weak even for you the latter implies that my proof depends on their opinion somehow who does not accept that there are triangles won t accept pythagoras wow that s an incredible insight i don t have to prove them wrong in their opinion it is possible to show that their systems leave out useful information respectively claims unreliable or even absurd statements to be information totally circular and totally useless their wish to believe makes them believe things are judges by their appeal and not by their information it makes you feel good when you believe that may be good for them but it contains zillions of possible pitfalls from belief despite contrary evidence to the bogus proofs they attempt truth by blatant assertion i ve seen as many bogus proofs of the non existence of gods as i have of their existence rational systems by the way does not mean that every data has to come from logical analysis the point is that the evaluation of the data does not contradict logic it easily follows that such a system does not allows to evaluate if its rational in itself yes it is possible to evaluate that it is rational in a system that is not rational by the fallacies of that system but since the validity of the axioms is agreed upon that has as little impact as the possibility of a demon ala descartes this just doesn t parse sorry so far it just a matter of consistency i use ratiional arguments to show that my system is consistent or that theirs isn t the evaluation of the nor this predictions does not need rationality it does not contradict however your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics and mathematics are therfore circular anybody else think godel was silly stream of consciousness typing what is that supposed to mean the first part of the second statement contains no information because you don t say what the beliefs are if the beliefs are strong theism and or strong atheism then your statement is not in general true the second part of your sentence is patently false counterexample an axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis but is assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is used to obtain it i ve been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions of god here an axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here is a an often refuted fallacy have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice and further one can evaluate axioms in larger systems out of which they are usually derived i exist is derived if you want it that way further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms what is it you are trying to say that at some point people always wind up saying this datum is reliable for no particular reason at all example i am not dreaming nope there is evidence for it the trick is that the choice of an axiomatic basis of a system is difficult because the possibilities are interwoven one therefore chooses that with the least assumptions or with assumptions that are necessary to get information out of the system anyway i d like to see this alleged evidence one does not need to define axioms in order to define an evaluation method for usefulness the foundation is laid by how one feels at all that s not how one feels about it i see you have no irrational beliefs but then fanatics never do do they compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational i can t agree with this until you are specific which theism to say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which i suspect you do not have using the traditonal definition of gods personal supernatural entities with objective effects on this world usually connected to morals and or the way the world works imo any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational that does not mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of intelligence some atheists are also scientists for example they don t use theism when doing science or it wouldn t be science please note that subjective data lend themselves to a scientific treatment as well they just prohibit formulating them as objective statements ergo nothing is objective fair enough the affinity to fanatism is easily seen it has to be true because i believe it is nothing more than a work hypothesis however the beliefs say they are more than a work hypothesis i don t understand this can you formalise your argument person a believes system b becuase it sounds so nice that does not make b true it is at best a work hypothesis however the content of b is that it is true and that it is more than a work hypothesis testing or evaluating evidence for or against it therefore dismissed because b already believed says it is wrong a waste of time not possible depending on the further contents of b amalekites idolaters protestants are to be killed this can have interesting effects peculiar definition of interesting but sure now show that a belief in gods entails the further contents of which you speak why aren t my catholic neighbours out killing the protestants for example maybe they don t believe in it maybe it s the conjunction of b asserts b and jail kill dissenters that is important and the belief in gods is entirely irrelevant it certainly seems so to me but then i have no axe to grind here the example with your neighbours is a fallacy that your neighbours don t says little about others and there were times when exactly that happened nope it s not a fallacy it just doesn t go to the correlation you wish to see and tell me when it is not irrelevant why are such statements about amalekites and idolaters in the holy books please note that one could edit them out when they are not relevant anymore because gods don t err what does that say about that message excuse me the holy books and how come we had theists saying genocides ordered by god are ok a god is the

re after years can we say that christian morality is in article apr cnsvax uwec edu nyeda cnsvax uwec edu david nye writes reply to frank d s uucp frank o dwyer the problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be established if we accept that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to what ought to be see naturalistic fallacy then they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world this can be avoided in at least two ways by leaving the good undefined since anyone who claims that they do not know what it is is either lying or so out of touch with humanity as to be undeserving of a reply if the good is undefined undefinable but you require of everyone that they know innately what is right you are back to subjectivism no and begging the question see below by defining the good solely in terms of evaluative terms ditto here an evaluative statement implies a value judgement on the part of the person making it again incorrect and question begging see below at this point the objectivist may talk of self evident truths pretty perceptive that prof flew but can he deny the subjectivist s claim that self evidence is in the mind of the beholder of course by denying that subject object is true dichotomy please explain how this helps i don t see your argument i don t see yours it seems to rest on the assertion that everything is either a subject or an object there s nothing compelling about that dichotomy i might just as well divide the world into subject object event it even seems more sensible causation for example is an event not a subject or an object furthermore if subject object were true dichotomy i e everything is either a subject or an object then is that statement a self evident truth or not if so then it s all in the mind of the beholder according to the relativist and hardly compelling add to that the fact that the world can quickly be shoved in its entirety into the subjective category by an idealist or solipsist argument and that we have this perfectly good alternate set of categories subject object event which can be reduced to subject object quality without any logical difficulty and why yes i guess i am denying that self evident truths are all in the mind of the beholder if not what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true all of it if nothing then no moral judgements are true this is a thing that is commonly referred to as nihilism it entails that science is of no value irrepective of the fact that some people find it useful how anyone arrives at relativism subjectivism from this argument beats me this makes no sense either flew is arguing that this is where the objectivist winds up not the subjectivist furthermore the nihilists believed in nothing except science materialism revolution and the people i m referring to ethical nihilism the subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself to hold a moral opinion is he suggests not to know something to be true but to have preferences regarding human activity and if those preferences should include terrorism that moral opinion is not true likewise if the preferences should include noterrorism that moral opinion is not true why should one choose a set of preferences which include terrorisim over one which includes noterrorism oh no reason this is patently absurd and also not the position of the subjectivist as has been pointed out to you already by others ditch the strawman already and see my reply to mike cobb s root message in the thread societal basis for morality i ve responded over there btw i don t intend this as a strawman but as something logically entailed by relativism really any ethical system where values are assumed to be unreal it s different to say relativists say than relativism implies frank o dwyer i m not hatching that odwyer sse ie from hens by evelyn conlon

premises hardly debate otherwise your favorite point that we sense so it hs to be there has been challenged more than once when i did it you said good question and did not address it i ve addressed it your caricature is not my favourite point needless to say at length in a previous outing and am currently discussing it with eric rescorla b there s little point in responding the same points everywhere i do my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply you still repeat that point i do curious since i believe that was the first time i ve ever made it not that repetition would imply much more than your seeming inability to understand you ask me the same question i ll give you the same answer especially when in this case i know the answer to be true i do my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply but if everyone is making the same points and i m pushed for time then i try to respond what i believe are the strongest formulations of those points if that doesn t include your post tough this is usenet and life is tough all over c since there s a great deal of responses this isn t always feasible i do my best to honestly answer questions put to me you drop out of debates with some posters and continue with others you appear with the same issue every n months and start the dicussion at the beginning again i ve only debated this issue twice in a a and occasionally in t a the first was in response to simon clippingdale s positive assertion that disagreement about moral values inexorably acknowledges that morals are relative it doesn t now simon has dropped out of the debate for some time i take that to mean that he is either busy or bored with the topic i certainly do not accuse him of dishonesty do you d i can t always understand what you say neither can t i understand you all the time usually one asks what the other side means usually one does usually you re clear but sometimes you aren t and i ask you what you mean other times you seem to get extremely uptight and i feel that i m debating against line noise sometimes i get tired and sometimes i have other things i d rather do again this is usenet and life is tough all over you re going to have to deal with it e you re starting to get personally insulting i may not even put your name in the hat in future that s supposed to be a threat no that s a simple statement and an assertion that i am not answerable to those who offer me baseless insults for example those who accuse me of lying about my personal beliefs while also complaining that i don t answer their questions like that you what you sense is evidence for the sensed to be there if only everything would be so easy what almost everyone senses is evidence for the sensed to be there because to all intents and purposes it is there we had that argument for one your claim that everyone senses it is not founded and you have been asked to give evidence for it often and then the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it is there unless evidence against it has been found i have no problem with the second statement i have provided an argument that almost everyone senses that freedom is valuable the only cogent objection to this came from jon livesey and was offered by some other people too essentially that people disagree about fuzzy concepts such as freedom it s a good point and i m thinking about it your trick is to say i feel a is not right and so do many i know therefore a is absolutely right it neglects the possibility that these people consider a to be right as an effect of the same process restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject of that process in other words refutes it you make the ontological claim you have to prove it nonsense my trick is to say i feel that a is better than b and so does almost any disinterested person i ask best evidence is therefore that a really is better than b subject to the assumption that we can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by a and b and that the resulting system of values is self consistent now get this really is better is an idealisation a fictional model in the same sense that real material existence is a fictional model it may or may not correspond to something true it is nonetheless a useful assumption far more useful than the equally assumed relativist trick to wit i feel that a is better than b and so does almost any disinterested person i ask however if even one person disagrees that a is better than b or if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of a and b then it is the case that b is better than a for that person and nothing more can be said i say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority seeking to maximise a cannot morally take action against someone seeking to maximise b e g a terrorist to do that would be to claim that a supermajority s carefully considered morality would be better than the terrorist s which would of course be true but a no no for an ethical relativist to claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is simply weasel words and an example of compartmentalisation to rival anything in the world of religion for a similar argument i sense morality is subjective it does not hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by others if you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively wrong and it turns out not to be the case for you of course this is possible it is neither evidence for subjectivism nor evidence against objectivism except sometimes in a pragmatic sense it serves as a counterexample for that everything that is subject to judgements is absolute and as long as you don t provide evidence for that there is something universally agreed upon there is no reason to believe your hypothesis i ve done this freedom with the proviso that i still have to answer jon s objection that fuzzy concepts like freedom have no objective meaning further in order to make morality absolute universal or objective you would have to show that it is independent of humans or the attributes above look quite misleading not really what evidence is there that anything exists independently of humans you ll be hard pressed to find any that isn t logically equivalent when applied to values an analogous set of premises would be premise some people believe that objectively speaking the shortest route from my house to a bar is through the main entrance of the estate and down the malahide road premise i checked it out and found that the shortest route from my which is much closer you would never deduce from these that there is no shortest route from my house to a bar yet that is seemingly how you derive your relativist claim using premises which are logically no different no morals are a matter of belief so far the people still believe that the shortest way is through the main entrance no agreement on belief here and in order to have an analogy you would have to show that there is a shortest way and that there is a method to convince everyone of that it is the shortest way indeed in other words your analogy works only when one assumes that your premises are right in the first place if not it is a fallacy and if this were an argument for objectivism you d be right it isn t though it s a demonstration that the argument you gave me is neither argument against objectivism nor argument for relativism your gimmick is to assume in the first place that values aren t real and to use this to prove that values aren t real in other words you beg the question against me frank o dwyer i m not hatching that odwyer sse ie from hens by evelyn conlon

re after years can we say that christian morality is in r n hfj horus ap mchp sni de frank d s uucp writes deletia in case anybody hadn t noticed frank and i are debating objective morality and seemingly hitting semantics secondly how can i refute your definition i can only point up its logical implications and say that they seem to contradict the usage of the word objective in other areas indeed by your definition an objective x is an oxymoron for all x i have no quibble with that belief other than that it is useless and that objective is a perfectly good word it may be that being a non native english speaker i ve misunderstood your usage of objective and tried to debate something you don t assert my apologies i m at a loss to imagine what you really do mean though how many ages can the universe have and still be internally self consistent i d be amazed if it was more than one how many different moral systems can different members of society have indeed single individuals in some cases and humanity still stick together begging the question people can have many opinions about the age of the universe and humanity can still stick together you are saying that the universe has a real age independent of my beliefs about it why wrong point the age of the universe has no direct effect on humanity s sticking power in the way the moral system of a society can have i m saying the universe has a real age because i see evidence for it cosmology astronomy and so on i say this age is independent of people s opinions of it because i know different people have a lot of different opinions in the matter yet empirical tests consistently seem to give roughly the same results the age of the universe like most scientific facts can be emirically verified through means that ll give the same result no matter who performs the testing albeit there are error bars that may be on the largish side this assumes that the universe has a real age or any kind of reality which doesn t depend on what we think i can t see how it does that put a creationist to the task of performing the tests and calculations see to it s he makes no blatant errors in measuring or calculating and the result of the test will be the same why should an extreme biblical creationist give a rat s ass about the means of which you speak because logically consistent empirical tests contradict their opinion if those tests were just my opinion then their own tests which would then be their opinion would contradict mine even if we conducted said tests in identical manner no they don t which i take as showing these tests have some validity beyond our opinion of them i ve heard of no way to verify morality in a consistent way much less compute the errors of the measurement care to enlighten me the same is true of pain but painkillers exist and can be predicted to work with some accuracy better than a random guess map the activity of nerves and neural activity if you mean physical pain you have a sharp point i ll give you that but you still haven t given me a way to quantify morality i wrote elsewhere that morality should be hypotheses about observed value we agree hypotheses however can change i hold that there is no ultimate hypothesis of morality towards which these changes could gravitate but that they could be changed in any way imaginable producing different results suitable for different tasks or purposes if a moral system makes a prediction it will be better if that can be tested better and worse are almost always defined in the context of a moral system your prediction will always be correct within that moral system what you need now is an objective definition of good and bad i wish you luck people s ideas about the age of object x are not objective you can have any idea you like and i can t stop you universae and their ages is another ballgame they are what they are and if you dislike some detail of them that s a problem with your opinion of them sure assume an objective reality and you get statements like this isn t that what you re doing when assuming an objectively real morality besides what exactly is provably wrong with my statement i claim that morality is an opinion of ours and as such subjective and individual if i m wrong then some more or less objectively real thing exists which you label objective morality can you back up this positive claim of existence can you back up your positive claim above no that s because it s an assumption i make the same assumption about values on the basis that there is no logical difference between the two and the empirical basis of the two is precisely the same claiming there is no objective morality is suddenly a positive claim besides i think i can lend some credence to my claim ponder different individuals both fully functional as human beings and members of society but yet with wildly different moral codes if morality was objective at least one should be way off base but yet hir incorrect morality seems to function fine how come as for producing these individuals it might be easiest to pick them from different societies say an islamic one and some polynesian matrilineal system for example if such still exist deletia testing for footballs on desks now take a look at morality see anything if so please inform me which way to look and why to look that particular way as opposed to some other get my drift no just look are you claiming never to know what good means one thing is good under some circumstances because we wish to achieve some goal for some reason other times we wish to do something else and that thing is no longer so clearly good at all some things are hard to make good because we d seldom if ever wish to achieve the sort of goal mass murder would lead one into still the aztecs were doing fine until the spaniards wiped them out i almost always know what good means sometimes i even know why i never claim this good is thereby fixed in stone immutable that s a simple matter of proving the track record of the scientific method i think it s great and should be applied to values i may be completely wrong but that s what i conclude as a result of quite an amount of thought yes me too and i ve tried a thing or two down that line it doesn t look good for objective values to me at all disclaimer it s great to be young and insane

more best of a a rapture october what to do in case you miss the rapture i stay calm and do not panic your natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to panic but to do so is absolutely useless now if you had wanted to get right with god before the rapture you could have but you chose to wait now your only chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the tribulation but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved matthew ii realize you are now living during the great tribulation the great tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of the rapture until christ s second coming also know as the time of jacob s israel s trouble jere and daniel s seventieth week dan this period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror iii gather as many bibles as you can and hide them soon after the antichrist becomes the leader of the european community the revived roman empire bibles will be confiscated and owning a bible will be tantamount to treason the bible however will be your most valuable possession during the tribulation iv read the bible like you have never read it before in your life since all of your bibles may be confiscated even if you are careful it is imperative that you read the word until you memorize whole passages and can quote them it is especially important to read daniel luke matthew revelation and amos for these books describe the events you can expect to unfold before you v pray like you have never prayed before in your life pray until the power of god comes strongly upon you pray and pray and pray only by reading the word and praying will you gain the spiritual strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the sake of christ vi do not take the mark at any cost even in fit means you and your loved ones die as martyrs after the antichrist becomes the leader of the european community he will institute a world economic system designed so that you cannot buy sell or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name money will be useless and he causes all both small and great rich and poor free and slave to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name here is wisdom let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast for it is the number of a man his number is revelation the antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of humanity think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed in the past such as the holocaust or maybe the crusades m you cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the antichrist s rule it will be much worse than anything in history matt i saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held and a white robe was given to each of them and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer until both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren who would be killed as they were was completed revelation his targets will be jews and christians who do not worship his image or take the mark on their forehead or right hadn and i saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to jesus and for the word of god who had not worshiped the beast or his image and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on the hands revelation he will use every form of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce christ nor will he hesitate to use your loved ones against you even your children torturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take the mark if you take the mark or worship the antichrist or his image however you will be consigned to the second death which is the lake of fire sung about so eloquently by johnny cash m you cannot be redeemed it is better to endure torture for a short while and gain eternal life then sic to endure eternal torment in the ring h h h h lake of fire if anyone worships the beast and his image and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand he himself shall also drink the wine of the wrath of god which is poured out full strength into the cup of his indignation an sic he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb revelation and probably in the presence of season ticket holders special hats given to the first at the stadium m vii set a plan in motion for survival although you may not be able to hide from the antichrist s government until the end of the tribulation all of the time you gain in hiding is important for your spiritual growth and strengthening since only those who are extremely strong in christ can suffer and die for his sake the first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or mountainous area for the antichrist s control will come last to the least populated areas take a good radio or tv with you so that you can stay attuned to events and discern the time schedule of the tribulation as you can see on the weather map heavy currents of tribulation will sweep into our area by daybreak expect delays on i outbound and perhaps school closings m store water and food because you will not be able to purchase anything without the mark water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste from nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood get a good water filter m bring different types of clothing for all seasons as well as flashlights batteries generators and first aid supplies in short learn how to survive and live off the land as the pioneers did viii trust no one there will be secret agents everywhere spying for the antichrist s government be on the lookout perot supporters take note m ix watch for the antichrist it is important to realize who the antichrist is and what he is up to for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will bring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it we can infer from daniel certain characteristics of this man popular during the first three and a half years of the tribulation he will dominate the airwaves he will be physically appealing highly intelligent with christ like charisma and personality an international politician military tactician and economic expert his word will be peace he will make a treaty with the jews which he will break after three and a half years he will have such supernatural power that a mortal wound to his head will be healed even the very elect will be deceived if you do not pray and read the bible you too will be deceived dominate the airwaves perhaps howard stern or rush limbaugh m the antichrist will have a companion the false prohphet sic who will make an image in the likeness of the antichrist and cause it to speak all who refuse to worhsip sic the image will be killed the final three and a half years will be absolutely insane with demonized spirits everywhere x do not give up hope the seven years of tribulation will end with the triumphant return of christ the antichrist will be defeated be steadfast and endure and you will be rewarded greatly in heaven start reading the bible and praying fervently now the salvation of your sould depends upon it determine that come what may you will not take the mark or worship the antichrist you still have a chance to be saved or remain saved but this time you will have to be faithful unto death may god find you ready in the hour of his glorious

re are atoms real in article c ue t g k news rich bnr ca bcash crchh nosubdomain nodomain brian cash writes petri and mathew your discusion on the reality of atoms is interesting but it would seem that you are verging on the question is anything real that is since observation is not reliable how can we say that anything is real i don t think this was the intention of the original question since you now define out the word real so that nothing can meet its criteria just a thought brian ps rainbows and shadows are real they are not objects they are phenomenon an interesting question would be if atoms are objects classical or phenomenon neo quantum or what i ve been following this train of talk and the question of dismissing atoms as being in some sense not real leaves me uneasy it seems to be implied that we obseve only the effects and therefore the underlying thing is not necessarily real the tree outside my window is in this category is observe the light which bounces off of it not the tree itself the observation is indirect but no more so than observations i have made of atoms also what about observations and experiments that have been routinely done with individual atoms i am thinking in particular of atom trapping experiments and tests of fundamental quantum mechanics such as the quantum zeno effect where an individual atom is studied for a long period of time some of the attempts at quantum mechanical arguments were not very satisfying either one has to be carefull about making such arguments without a solid technical background in the field what i read seemed a little confused a quite a red herring anyway if the purpose of a public debate is to make the audience think it worked after doing so i m willing to try to defend the following assertion if anyone cares atoms are as real as trees and are real in the ussual every day sense of the word real

re atheism survey i replied to this query via e mail but i think there are some issues that are worth discussing in public mta mtabbott unix amherst edu wrote i am doing research on atheism part of which involves field research here on the net the following is a survey directed towards all readers of this group intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief i would recommend you to take a look at your dictionary alt atheism faq files to notice that atheism is not a belief system and what is common to all atheists is not a belief but a lack of belief in deities i cannot imagine how anyone could do research on atheism without paying careful attention to this issue first of all i ve tried to structure questions that can be answered in a variety of ways with varying amounts of detail it s possible to give succinct answers to most everything but there s enough here to keep most of you typing for hours i m sure imho this is a poor method to do any real survey although i m sure the replies might keep you amused for hours also i tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like belief system although i know some of you might contend that you don t have any beliefs but are skeptical towards everything i understand but you know what i mean think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases required to get the precise idea across no i do not know what you mean if you are surveying our individual philosophies fine but that s not strictly atheism atheism is not just another godless version of the theistic explanations for life the universe and everything it is not a belief system and it could hardly be called a philosophical system once more atheism is characterised by lack of belief in deities do not twist the meaning or assume that we have some kind of philosophy we all agree on some comments on your questions what contact with other atheists have you had before and after and during your conversion to atheism certainly your involvement with alt atheism counts how have net discussions affected your beliefs i would also like to hear more about this have we been able to convert anyone are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational means proofs of the non existence of god etc or was it perhaps at least in part through other means alienation from mainstream religion etc this question contains a contradiction in terms beliefs cannot be acquired rationally if they could they would not be beliefs you also seem to have rather strange ideas of how people become atheists those who are alienated from religion do not necessarily become atheists they just think very little about religion it seems it requires a considerable time of honest inquiry to find out that religions are actually intellectually dishonest virtual realities those who have never had beliefs will certainly find this question quite odd how can lack of belief be acquired when did i acquire lack of belief in the easter bunny i did believe in santa though to what extent do you feel you understand the universe through your beliefs what phenomena of the universe and of human existence anything from physical phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs do you feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs and where are they lacking as an explanatory method this question does not make any sense since atheism does not deal with these issues it is not a worldview or a philosophy or a belief system sigh why haven t i seen a good well thought survey in the usenet for three years and what is the point of doing surveys in the net anyway just to abstract some opinions petri petri pihko kem pmp mathematics is the truth pihatie c finou oulu fi physics is the rule of sf oulu kempmp the game finland phoenix oulu fi chemistry is the game
re theism and fanatism was islamic genocide in article bb b i dbstu rz tu bs de i dbstu rz tu bs de benedikt rosenau writes in article r sn r horus ap mchp sni de frank d s uucp frank o dwyer writes theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in absolutes irrational belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with fanatism deletion theism is correlated with fanaticism i have neither said that all fanatism is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanatism the point is theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic one could of course argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism for example but i just have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it imo the influence of stalin or for that matter ayn rand invalidates your assumption that theism is the factor to be considered bogus i just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism the point is that theism is a factor that s your claim now back it up i consider your argument as useful as the following belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism therefore belief is a factor in fanaticism true and utterly useless note this is any belief not belief in gods gullibility blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on are all more reliable indicators and the really dangerous people the sources of fanaticism are often none of these things they are cynical manipulators of the gullible who know precisely what they are doing that s a claim you have to support please note that especially in the field of theism the leaders believe what they say if you believe that you re incredibly naive now some brands of theism and more precisely some theists do tend to fanaticism i grant you to tar all theists with this brush is bigotry not a reasoned argument and it reads to me like a warm up for censorship and restriction of religious freedom ever read animal farm that s a straw man and as usually in discussions with you one has to repeat it read what i have written above not every theism leads to fanatism and not all fanatism is caused by theism the point is there is a correlation and it comes from innate features of theism no some of it comes from features which some theism has in common with some fanaticism your last statement simply isn t implied by what you say before because you re trying to sneak in innate features of all theism the word you re groping for is some gullibility by the way is one of them no shit sherlock so why not talk about gullibility instead of theism since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have as opposed to the case you are trying to make and to say that i am going to forbid religion is another of your straw men interesting that you have nothing better to offer i said it reads like a warm up to that that s because it s an irrational and bogus tirade and has no other use than creating a nice them us split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either side of church walls define irrational belief e g is it rational to believe that reason is always useful irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason the latter has been discussed for a long time with charley wingate one point is that the beliefs violate reason often and another that a process that does not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information well there is a glaring paradox here an argument that reason is useful based on reason would be circular and argument not based on reason would be irrational which is it that s bogus self reference is not circular and since the evaluation of usefulness is possible within rational systems it is allowed o k it s oval it s still begging the question however and though that certainly is allowed it s not rational and you claiming to be rational and all at the risk of repeating myself and hearing we had that before we didn t hear a refutation before so we re back deal with it you can t use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful someone who thinks reason is crap won t buy it you see your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics and mathematics are therfore circular anybody else think godel was silly the first part of the second statement contains no information because you don t say what the beliefs are if the beliefs are strong theism and or strong atheism then your statement is not in general true the second part of your sentence is patently false counterexample an axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis but is assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is used to obtain it i ve been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions of god here an axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here is a an often refuted fallacy have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice and further one can evaluate axioms in larger systems out of which they are usually derived i exist is derived if you want it that way further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms what is it you are trying to say that at some point people always wind up saying this datum is reliable for no particular reason at all example i am not dreaming compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational i can t agree with this until you are specific which theism to say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which i suspect you do not have using the traditonal definition of gods personal supernatural entities with objective effects on this world usually connected to morals and or the way the world works imo any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational that does not mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of intelligence some atheists are also scientists for example the affinity to fanatism is easily seen it has to be true because i believe it is nothing more than a work hypothesis however the beliefs say they are more than a work hypothesis i don t understand this can you formalise your argument person a believes system b becuase it sounds so nice that does not make b true it is at best a work hypothesis however the content of b is that it is true and that it is more than a work hypothesis testing or evaluating evidence for or against it therefore dismissed because b already believed says it is wrong a waste of time not possible depending on the further contents of b amalekites idolaters protestants are to be killed this can have interesting effects peculiar definition of interesting but sure now show that a belief in gods entails the further contents of which you speak why aren t my catholic neighbours out killing the protestants for example maybe they don t believe in it maybe it s the conjunction of b asserts b and jail kill dissenters that is important and the belief in gods is entirely irrelevant it certainly seems so to me but then i have no axe to grind here frank o dwyer i m not hatching that odwyer sse ie from hens by evelyn

re yet more rushdie re islamic law in article apr nic csu net davec silicon csci csusb edu dave choweller wrote in article apr bnr ca rashid writes stuff deleted the point of my post was that rushdie was not being condemned solely for the words in his book although this was certainly a contributing factor it was the whole series of actions of rushdie and his publishers following the publication of the book and the initial media spotlight placed on the book that in large part led to the fatwa the kind of fatwa levelled against rushdie is not lightly placed and there are any number of anti islamic writers both within and outside the islamic world who have not had fatwas made against them here someone who adds fuel to an explosive situation might be charged with incitement to riot if people die in the rioting the charges against him might become even more serious how can rushdie be blamed for the deaths of people who are demonstrating against him the deaths should be blamed on the people who dealt with the demonstrations or on the demonstrators themselves if they were violent to what lengths will you go to justify this barbaric behaviour against rushdie once the rushdie situation exploded into the media the muslim voice on the matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes showing the dramatic highlights of muslim demonstrations for every twenty or so newspaper magazine articles interviews etc supporting rushdie there would appear one muslim voice this person was usually selected based on how dramatic and incoherent he was not on his knowledge of islam or the situation at the time this approx twenty to one ratio continued throughout the escalation of the crisis with rushdie in the central spotlight as the man of the moment the valiant defender of everyman s right to free speech decoupled from responsibility as an aside it s interesting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up some books defaming certain ethnic and religious groups continued to be banned here it was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these groups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of hate towards these groups for muslims this kind of double standard was annoying rushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at organized islam and he did so with admirable verbal skill the only kind of islam which rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a secular islam an islam separated from it s qur an it s prophet god its legislation and most importantly from any intrusion into any political arena fine rushdie made his views known the muslim s made their anger at his book known the scale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions it was by this time already a political situation affecting governments as well as individuals the situation was a serious one with far reaching political implications at the centre of this turmoil was rushdie throwing fuel on the fire engaged in a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution now you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as this has no responsibility has no reason to exercise restraint of any kind has no obligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till matters calm down perhaps you even feel that he is justified in boldly defying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary work no matter what insult they find within it perhaps you see him as a kind of secular heroic knight mounted on the his media steed doing battle with the dragon of islamic fundamentalism well khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who grew up in a muslim atmosphere knew well what muslim s hold dear who wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions to slander insult and attack islam and its most notable personalities who when faced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis continued with his mischief in the world stage of the media who even after people were injured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation continued his mischief instead of having the good sense to desist khomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale mischief making that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged the deaths of muslims around the world and rushdie s continued media mischief even after this was the triggering factor that seemed to decide khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief the person at the centre of all these events was rushdie he was the source of the continuing mischief all media support government support was just that support the source was rushdie and his publishers who were nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy to see rushdie constantly in the media the islamic rulings that deal with people who engage in this kind of grand scale mischief making was applied to rushdie you re attempts at justification are not doing the image of islam any good i have made no attempts at justification only at explanation image is the chief concern of muslim apologists for islam and for rushdie if muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub culture within a larger secular culture such that the secular principles and laws had precedence over the laws of islam then i have no doubt that islam would then be thought to have a good image principally because it would by and large reflect the secular image a good image usually means be more like me your attempts at totally exonerating rushdie reflect exactly the attitude that resulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis in iran the situation was monitored for many months when rushdie kept adding fuel to the flames through the free worldwide voice that the media gave him the situation was monitored more seriously when even after many deaths occured worldwide rushdie still did not desist the fatwa was pronounced when behaving like a total jerk endangers lives and the jerk sees this and still insists on his right to behave like a total jerk he has the rug jerked out from under him if the muslims didn t make such a big fuss over the book like issuing death threats and killing publishers no one would have heard of it the fatwa came later much later if rushdie didn t mouth off so much in the media the fuss would have died down no one would have been killed no fatwa would have been passed the whole episode would have fizzled away

in article apr dcs warwick ac uk simon dcs warwick ac uk simon clippingdale writes i write imagine that alterian dollars turn up in your bank account every month suppose further that this money is being paid to you by a your big hearted alterian benefactor or b a bug in an alterian atm let s suppose that this is a true dichotomy so p a p b trouble is alterius is in a different universe so that no observations of alterius are possible except for the banks you couldn t possibly afford it now let s examine the case for a there is no evidence whatsoever that there is any such thing as a big hearted alterian benefactor however p exists b h a b p not exists b h a b on the grounds that lack of evidence for is evidence against when we have a partition like that we dismiss hypothesis a turning therefore to b we also find no evidence to support that hypothesis on the same grounds as before we dismiss hypothesis b the problem with this is that we have dismissed all of the possible hypotheses and even though we know by construction that the money arrives every month we have proven that it can t because we have dismissed all of its potential causes that s an extremely poor argument and here s why premise this money is being paid to you by either a your big hearted alterian benefactor or b a bug in an alterian atm thus each monthly appearance of the bucks should it happen is an observation on alterius and by construction is evidence for the existence of either the benefactor or the bug in the atm premise no observations on alterius are possible except for the banks you couldn t possibly afford it you forgot to include this my premise is actually premise the cardinality of the set of possible observations on alterius is one this is clearly contradictory to the first not if you state it properly trouble is on the basis of premise you say that there can be no evidence of either the benefactor or the bug but the first premise leads to the conclusion that the appearance of the bucks should it happen is evidence for the existence of either the benefactor or the bug voila a screaming contradiction with my highlights sc but in a strawman argument there is only evidence for oneof benefactor bug no observation to distinguish benefactor from bug is possible that is not evidence for bug and neither is it evidence for benefactor nor is true to say that this hypothetical universe appears exactly as if there were no benefactor bug two statements both would be false this is still contradictory it reduces to alterian dosh arriving in my account is due to benefactor or bug this is not evidence for benefactor neither is it evidence for bug meaning that it doesn t lend more weight to one than to the other therefore no evidence can exist for benefactor and no evidence can exist for bug but relies on a shift in meaning from when you say paraphrased in that this is not evidence for benefactor for example what you mean is that it s no more evidence for benefactor than it is for bug yes that s what i mean in however you ve shifted the meaning of evidence for benefactor so that it now means absolute evidence for benefactor rather than relative evidence for benefactor w r t bug not really i meant evidence that would tend to one over the other i think this is just a communications problem what i am trying to say in my clumsy way is that while i buy your theory as far as it relates to theism making predictions prayer your rapture example i don t buy your use of occam s razor in all cases where a in my example one couldn t dismiss benefactor or bug on the grounds of simplicity one of these is necessary to explain the dosh i brought up the one by one dismissal process to show that it would be wrong to do so from what you re saying in this post it seems you agree and we re talking at cross purposes is still in contradiction to some sums may help with b benefactor b bug d dosh arrives in account implies p b b d assuming that p bb d so it s either the benefactor or a bug which is responsible if the bucks arrive but not both then p b b d p b d p b d so p b d p b d but implies that p b d and p b d no this isn t what i meant p b d and p b d with necessarily no new observation we ve already seen the dosh to change those estimates i was trying to say again in my clumsy way that it would be wrong to assign probability to either of these and that s precisely what use of the razor does in the case of gods gods are one class of hypothesis there are many others belonging to a set of hypotheses one of which is necessary to explain something which otherwise would not be satisfactorily explained it can be thrown out or retained on grounds of non rational preference not of science or statistics alternatively one could chuck out or retain the lot on the grounds that the answer can t be known or that the notional probability estimates are effectively useless being equal agnosticism weak atheism as they do when the set m is filled by the universe is caused by x where x is gods pink unicorns nothing etc and no observation tends to one conclusion over the other exactly the point i was making i think so we don t throw out any of these contrary to your assertion above that we do some people do simon and they think they are doing excellent science my sole point was that they aren t only observations which directly contradict the hypothesis h i i e x where p x h i can cause p h i to go to zero after a finite number of observations only in this case do we get to throw any of the hypotheses out exactly my point though i may have been unclear you said the diametric opposite which i guess is the source of my confusion i was merely trying to illustrate the incorrectness of doing so what i m trying to say is that while you are correct to say that absence of evidence can sometimes be evidence of absence this does not hold true for all or perhaps any versions of theism and it isn t true that those for which it does not hold can be discarded using the razor on the contrary those for which it does not hold are exactly those which can be discarded using the razor see my post on the other branch of this thread then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of if the razor holds for gods then it holds for all like hypotheses which means that you re assigning p x h i for all i though we ve already established that it s not correct to do so when sum p x h i over all i simply put anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or non existence of gods whether inductive or no is at best mistaken and at worst barking mad luckily i make no such claim and have specifically said as much on numerous occasions you wouldn t be constructing a strawman here would you frank although that doesn t of course rule out my being barking mad in any case i could be barking mad in my spare time with apologies to cleese et al but i think you miss the point once again when i say that something is evidence against an hypothesis that doesn t imply that observation of the said something necessarily falsifies the hypothesis reducing the estimate of p h data to zero if it reduces this quantity it s still evidence against h no i got that i m talking about the case when a you re clearly correct when a and i m not constructing a strawman though it s certainly possible that i ve misunderstood what you re saying however by any standards a system that says when a gods are highly unlikely and when a gods can be dismissed using the razor is a system purporting to be an inductive proof that gods either don t exist or are unnecessary to explain any or all phenomena in my experience systems such as this including those which purport to prove that gods exist always contain a fallacy upon close examination if that s not what you re saying then please put me straight frank o dwyer i m not hatching that odwyer sse ie from hens by evelyn conlon

re a little too satanic kent sandvik and jon livesey made essentially the same response so this time kent s article gets the reply i agree but this started at one particular point in time and we don t know when this starting point of accurately copied scriptures actually happened this begs the question of whether it ever started perhaps because accuracy was always an intention even worse if the events in nt were not written by eye witness accounts a high probability looking at possible dates when the first gospels were ready then we have to take into account all the problems with information forwarded with the telephone metaphor indeed it makes little difference if you have eyewitnesses or people one step away reporters if you will as i said earlier the telephone metaphor is innately bad because the purpose of a game of telephone is contrary to the aims of writing these sorts of texts also i would point out that by the standards generally asserted in this group the distinction between eyewitnesses and others is hollow since nobody can be shown to be an eyewitness or indeed even shown to be the author of the text there is no evidence that the original texts of either the ot or the nt are largely lost over time in a sea of errors corrections additions and deletions in the case of the nt the evidence is strongly in the other direction the textus r and the nestle aland text do not differ on more than a low level of significance it is reasonable to assume a similar situation for the ot based on the nt as a model c wingate the peace of god it is no peace but strife closed in the sod mangoe cs umd edu yet brothers pray for but one thing tove mangoe the marv lous peace of god

arguments for and against the existence of god it ranges from the classical philosophical positions of descartes anselm berkeley hume et al through the moral arguments of newman kant and sidgwick to the recent restatements of the classical theses by plantinga and swinburne it also addresses those positions which push the concept of god beyond the realm of the rational such as those of kierkegaard

re after years can we say that christian morality is arromdee jyusenkyou cs jhu edu ken arromdee writes simple take out some physics books and start looking for statements which say that there is no objective physics i doubt you will find any you might find statements that there is no objective length or no objective location but no objective physics perhaps you have a different understanding of what physics is if we can t measure anything objectively then the answers we get from physics aren t objective either that s what i mean when i say there s no objective physics sure we can all agree that say f gmm r but that s maths it s only physics when you relate it to the real world and if we can t do that objectively we re stuck of course this displays my blatant bias towards applied science but even theoretical physics gets applied to models of real world situations based on real world observations consider for instance that speed of light in vacuum is invariant this sounds an awful lot like an objective speed of light in vacuum it s an axiom that it s invariant but if the two of us measure it we ll get different answers yes we call that experimental error but it s not really error in the conventional sense in fact if you don t get any that s an error you could argue that the value of c is objective to within some value but i d call that a rather odd usage of the word objective and it opens the way for statements like murder is objectively wrong for all people to within of the total population mathew

re free moral agency andrew newell tan psuvm psu edu wrote i think you re letting atheist mythology confuse you on the issue of webster myth a traditional or legendary story a belief whose truth is accepted uncritically how does that qualify indeed it s almost oxymoronic a rather amusing instance i ve found that most atheists hold almost no atheist views as accepted uncritically especially the few that are legend many are trying to explain basic truths as myths do but they don t meet the other criterions andrew the myth to which i refer is the convoluted counterfeit athiests have created to make religion appear absurd rather than approach religion including christainity in a rational manner and debating its claims as the are stated atheists concoct outrageous parodies and then hold the religious accountable for beliefs they don t have what is more accurately oxymoric is the a term like reasonable atheist bill divine justice according to the most fundamental doctrines of christianity when the first man sinned he was at that time the you accuse him of referencing mythology then you procede to launch your own xtian mythology this time meeting all the requirements of myth here s a good example of of what i said above read the post again i said acoording to which means i am referring to christian doctrine as i understand it if i am speaking for myself you ll know it my purpose in posting was to present a basic overview of christain doctrines since it seemed germane bill with those who pretend not to know what is being said and what it means when atheists claim that they do not know if god exists and don t know what he wants they contradict the bible which clearly says that everyone knows the authority of the bible is its claim to be should i repeat what i wrote above for the sake of getting it across you may trust the bible but your trusting it doesn t make it any more credible to me if the bible says that everyone knows that s clearly reason to doubt the bible because not everyone knows your alleged god s alleged existance again i am paraphrasing christian doctrine which is very clear on this point your dispute is not with me bill refuted while the species wide condemnation is justified those that claim that there is no evidence for the existence of god or that his will is unknown must deliberately ignore the bible the ignorance itself is no excuse no they don t have to ignore the bible the bible is far from universally accepted the bible is not a proof of god it is only a proof that some people have thought that there was a god or does it prove even that they might have been writing it as series of fiction short stories as in the case of dionetics assuming the writers believed it the only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it and that s ignoring the problem of whether or not all the interpretations and biblical philosophers were correct there are people who have truly never heard of the bible again read the faq here again you miss the point the bible itself is not the point it s what it contains it makes no difference who accpets the bible or even who s unaware of its existence christians hold that it applies universally because mankind shares the same nature and the same fate and the same innate knowledge of god see above if you read my post with same care as read the faq we wouldn t be having this conversation bill freedom you are free to ignore god in the same way you are free to ignore gravity and the consequences are inevitable and well known in both cases that an atheist can t accept the evidence means only bzzt wrong answer gravity is directly there it doesn t stop exerting a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it god on the other hand doesn t generally show up

agree bill secondly human reason is very comforatble with the concept of god so much so that it is in itself intrinsic to our nature human reason always comes back to the question of god in every generation and in no human reason hasn t always come back to the existance of god it has usually come back to the existance of god in other words it doesn t generally come back to the xtian god it comes back to whether there is any god and in much of oriental philosophic history it generally doesn t pop up as the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces are and which ones are out there from a world wide view human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to be and or what force s are currently in control a natural tendancy to believe in god only exists in religious wishful thinking yes human reason does always come back to the existence of god we re having this discussion are we not bill i said all this to make the point that christianity is eminently reasonable that divine justice is just and human nature is much different than what atheists think it is whether you agree or not you certainly are not correct on human nature you are at the least basing your views on a completely eurocentric approach try looking at the outside world as well when you attempt to sum up all of humanity well this is interesting truth is to be determined by it

re cruel kmr po cwru edu keith m ryan writes i don t think so although some forms of execution are painful the electric chair looks particularly so i think the pain is relatively short lived drawing and quartering on the other hand looks very painful and the victim wouldn t die right away he d bleed to death i d imagine ah so a cruel punishment is not just if it is painful as you origionally stated it is about long term pain eg non short lived why this sudden chance in your stance i don t think i ve changed my stance at all my original stance was that a painless execution was not a cruel one i didn t say what would be considered cruel only that a painless death wasn t now cruelty must involve some sort of suffering i believe i don t think someone that gets shot in the head or electrocuted really suffers very much even a hanging probably produces one sharp instance of pain but it s over so quickly hmmmmm pardon could it be that a counter example has been made which renders your previous stance null and void why don t you admit that your previous stance is incorrect or if you somehow managed to slip up and misstated your origional stance why not admit it no well again i stated that a painless death isn t cruel but i don t think i stated that all painful executions are cruel i think that some are cruel depending on the nature and duration of the pain by the way how long is too long anything more than an instant i guess any death by suffocation asphyxiation or blood loss would be cruel i think this includes the gas chamber and drawing and quartering i d say that any pain that lasts say over twenty seconds or so would be too long but this may be an arbitrary cutoff i suppose keith

free energy technology free energy technology by robert e mcelwaine physicist ninety to a hundred years ago everybody knew that a heavier than air machine could not possibly fly it would violate the laws of physics all of the experts and authorities said so for example simon newcomb declared in the demonstration that no possible combination of known substances known forms of machinery and known forms of force can be united in a practical machine by which man shall fly long distances through the air seems to the writer as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any physical fact to be fortunately a few smart people such as the wright brothers did not accept such pronouncements as the final word now we take airplanes for granted except when they crash today orthodox physicists and other scientists are saying similar things against several kinds of free energy technologies using negative terms such as pseudo science and perpetual motion and citing so called laws which assert that energy cannot be created or destroyed st law of thermodynamics and there is always a decrease in useful energy nd law of thermodynamics the physicists do not know how to do certain things so they arrogantly declare that those things cannot be done such principles of impotence are common in orthodox modern science and help to cover up inconsistencies and contradictions in orthodox modern theories free energy inventions are devices which can tap a seemingly unlimited supply of energy from the universe with out burning any kind of fuel making them the perfect solution to the world wide energy crisis and its associated pollution degradation and depletion of the environment most free energy devices probably do not create energy but rather tap into existing natural energy sources by various forms of induction unlike solar or wind devices they need little or no energy storage capacity because they can tap as much energy as needed when needed solar energy has the dis advantage that the sun is often blocked by clouds trees buildings or the earth itself or is reduced by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and high latitudes likewise wind speed is widely variable and often non existent neither solar nor wind power are suitable to directly power cars and airplanes properly designed free energy devices do not have such limitations for example at least three u s patents and have so far been awarded for motors that run exclusively on permanent magnets seemingly tapping into energy circulating through the earth s magnetic field the first two require a feedback network in order to be self running the third one as described in detail in science mechanics magazine spring amazing magnet powered motor by jorma hyypia pages and front cover requires critical sizes shapes orientations and spacings of magnets but no feedback such a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible heatpump in one s home year round for free complete descriptive copies of u s patents are each from the u s patent office jefferson davis hwy arlington va correct digit patent number required or try getting copies of both the article and the patents via your local public or university library s inter library loan dept a second type of free energy device such as the gray motor u s patent the tesla coil and the motor of inventor joseph newman see science pages taps electro magnetic energy by induction from earth resonance about cycles per second plus harmonics they typically have a spark gap in the circuit which serves to synchronize the energy in the coils with the energy being tapped it is important that the total inductance and capacitance of the device combine to resonate at the same frequency as earth resonance in order to maximize the power output this output can also be increased by centering the spark gap at the neutral center of a strong u shaped permanent magnet in the case of a tesla coil slipping a toroid choke coil around the secondary coil will enhance output power earth energy fuelless propulsion power systems by john bigelow health research p o box mokelumne hill ca during the s an austrian civil engineer named viktor schauberger invented and partially developed an implosion turbine german name zokwendle after analyzing erosion and lack of erosion in differently shaped waterways and developing sophisticated mathematical equations to explain it as described in the book a breakthrough to new free energy sources by dan a davidson water is pumped by an impeller pump through a logarithmic spiral shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a critical velocity the water then implodes no longer touching the inside walls of the tubing and drives the pump which then converts the pump s motor into an electric generator the device seems to be tapping energy from that of the earth s rotation via the coriolis effect like a tornado it can also neutralize gravity a fourth type of free energy device is the mcclintock air motor u s patent which is a cross between a diesel engine it has three cylinders with a compression ratio of to and a rotary engine with solar and planetary gears it burns no fuel but becomes self running by driving its own air compressor this engine also generates a lot of heat which could be used to heat buildings and its very high torque makes it ideal for large trucks preventing their slowing down when climbing hills david mcclintock is also the real original inventor of the automatic transmission differential and wheel drive crystals may someday be used to supply energy as shown in the star trek shows perhaps by inserting each one between metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a common household smoke detector one other energy source should be mentioned here despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of free energy a bulgarian born american physicist named joseph maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic fusion reactor which he calls migma which uses non radioactive deuterium as a fuel available in nearly unlimited quantities from sea water does not produce radioactive waste can be converted directly into electricity with out energy wasting steam turbines and can be constructed small enough to power a house or large enough to power a city and unlike the tokamaks and laser fusion monstrosities that we read about migma works already producing at least three watts of power for every watt put in new times u s version pages and then there are the cold fusion experiments that have been in the news lately originally conducted by university of utah researchers b stanley pons and martin fleischmann some u s navy researchers at the china lake naval weapons center in california under the direction of chemist melvin miles finally took the trouble to collect the bubbles coming from such an apparatus had them analyzed with mass spectrometry techniques and found helium which proves that atomic fusion did indeed take place and enough of it to explain the excess heat generated there are good indications that the two so called laws of thermodynamics are not so absolute for example the late physicist dewey b larson developed a comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe which he calls the reciprocal system which he describes in detail in several books such as nothing but motion and the universe of motion in which the physical universe has two distinct halves the material half and an anti matter half with a continuous cycle of matter and energy passing between them with out the heat death predicted by thermodynamic laws his theory explains the universe much better than modern orthodox theories including phenomena that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching their heads about and is self consistent in every way some free energy devices might be tapping into that energy flow seemingly converting low quality energy into high quality energy also certain religious organizations such as sant mat and eckankar teach their members that the physical universe is only the lowest of at least a dozen major levels of existence like parallel universes or analogous to tv channels as described in books like the path of the masters by dr julian johnson and eckankar the key to secret worlds by sri paul twitchell for example the next level up from the physical universe is commonly called the astral plane long time members of these groups have learned to soul travel into these higher worlds and report on conditions there it seems plausible that energy could flow down from these higher levels into the physical universe or be created at the boundary between them given the right configuration of matter to channel it this is supported by many successful laboratory controlled experiments in psycho kinesis throughout the world such as those described in the book psychic discoveries behind the iron curtain in terms of economics the market has failed inventors do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop and mass produce free energy equipment and the conventional energy producer have no desire to do so because of their ve ted intere t the government is needed to intervene if the government does not intervene then the total supply of energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and will soon run out prices for energy will increase and pollution and its harmful effects including the greenhouse effect acid rain smog radioactive contamination oil spills rape of the land by strip mining etc will continue to increase the government should subsidize research and development of free energy by inventors and universities subsidize private production until the producers can make it on their own and subsidize consumption by low income consumers of free energy hardware the long range effects of such government intervention would be wide spread and profound the quantity of energy demanded from conventional energy producer coal mining companie oil companie and countries electric utilitie etc would drop to near zero forcing their employees to seek work elsewhere energy resources coal uranium oil and gas would be left in the ground prices for conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero while the price of free energy equipment would start out high but drop as supply increases as happened with vcr s personal computers etc costs of producing products that require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease along with their prices to consumers consumers would be able to realize the opportunity costs of paying electric utility bills or buying home heating fuel tourism would benefit and increase because travelers would not have to spend their money for gasoline for their cars government tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be obtained in some other way and energy could no longer be used as a motive or excuse for making war many conventional energy producer would go out of business but society as a whole and the earth s environment and ecosystems would benefit

re science and theories in article c u bq j news cso uiuc edu cobb alexia lis uiuc edu mike cobb writes as per various threads on science and creationism i ve started dabbling into a book called christianity and the nature of science by jp moreland as i don t know this book i will use your heresay a question that i had come from one of his comments he stated that god is not necessarily a religious term but could be used as other scientific terms that give explanation for events or theories without being a proven scientific fact it depends on how he defines god the way i understand the meaning of that term preclues it being used in a useful way in science ideas drawn from an understanding that god is supernatural precludes us from forming scientific assertions that can be falsified that is where we can decide that they are true or false within the terms of we use and useful observations drawn from them some religionists have an interest in bluring the definitions within science to make them more reconcilable and especially subserviant in a basic way to religious dogma this pursuit always fails i think i got his point i can quote the section if i m being vague the examples he gave were quarks and continental plates are there explanations of science or parts of theories that are not measurable in and of themselves or can everything be quantified measured tested etc reconciliation of science with religion involves circumventing the tendancy to claim that either pursuit can gain absolute or certian knowledge or that the domain of truth in each is fundementally limited in some way it gererally confurs the element of uncertainty and limitations to human knowledge while allowing for the different concerns of these separate pursuits science and religion ask different questions which have imperfect and provisional answers at best science is distinctly limited in where it can ask meaningful questions more questions can be posed than it can answer at the basis of sacred language is the place where words fail us and mere assertions disolve in contradiction bruce salem
re a little too satanic jon livesey writes so when they took the time to copy the text correctly that includes obvious corruptions well yes this is the real mystery of the matter and why i am rather dubious of a lot of the source theories there are a number of places where the masoretic text mt of the ot is obscure and presumably corrupted these are reproduced exactly from copy to copy the dss tend to reflect the same errors this would appear to tell us that at least from some point people began to copy the texts very exactingly and mechanically the problem is we don t know what they did before that but it seems as though accurate transmission begins at the point at which the texts are perceived as texts they may be added to and in some situations such as the end of mark material is lost but for the most part there are no substantial changes to the existing text you re basically trying to make a mountain out of a molehill some people like to use the game of telephone as a metaphor for the transmission of the texts this clearly wrong the texts are transmitted accurately c wingate the peace of god it is no peace but strife closed in the sod mangoe cs umd edu yet brothers pray for but one thing tove mangoe the marv lous peace of god
albert sabin br from wpr atlanta dg com bill rawlins br newsgroups alt atheism br organization dgsid atlanta ga br since you have referred to the messiah i assume you br are referring to the new testament please detail br your complaints or e mail if you don t want to post br first century greek is well known and br well understood have you considered josephus the jewish br historian who also wrote of jesus in addition br the four gospel accounts are very much in harmony it is also well known that the comments in josephus relating to jesus were inserted badly by later editors as for the four gospels being in harmony on the issue of jesus you know not of what you speak here are a few contradictions starting with the trial and continuing through the assension the death of judas after the betrayal of jesus acts now this man judas purchased a field with the reward of iniquity and falling headlong he burst asunder in the midst and all his bowels gushed out matt and he judas cast down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed and went and hanged himself and the chief priests bought with them the potter s field what was jesus prediction regarding peter s denial before the cock crow matthew before the cock crow twice mark how many times did the cock crow mar and the second time the cock crew and peter called to mind the word that jesus said unto him before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny me thrice and when he thought thereon he wept mat then began he to curse and to swear saying i know not the man and immediately the cock crew mat and peter remembered the word of jesus which said unto him before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice and he went out and wept bitterly luk and peter said man i know not what thou sayest and immediately while he yet spake the cock crew luk and the lord turned and looked upon peter and peter remembered the word of the lord how he had said unto him before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice joh jesus answered him wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake verily verily i say unto thee the cock shall not crow still thou hast denied me thrice joh peter then denied again and immediately the cock crew destruction of cities what said was jeremiah was zechariah this is interesting because matthew quotes a prophesy that was never made not the only time he does this either mat then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet saying and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him that was valued whom they of the children of israel did value zechariah nothing in jeremiah remotely like what was the color of the robe placed on jesus during his trial scarlet matthew purple john the time of the crucifiction mark says the third hour or a m but john says the sixth hour noon was when the sentence was passed inscription on the cross matthew this is jesus the king of the jews mark the king of the jews luke this is the king of the jews john jesus of nazareth the king of the jews what did they give him to drink vinegar matthew wine with myrrh mark women at the cross matthew said many stood far off including mary magdaline mary the mother of james and the mother of zebedee s children mark and luke speak of many far off and mark includes mary magdeline and mary the mother of james the less john says that jesus s mother stood at the cross along with her sister and mary magdalene jesus last words matt and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying eli eli lama sabachthani that is to say my god my god why hast thou forsaken me jesus when he cried again with a loud voice yielded u the ghost luke and when jesus had cried with a loud voice he said father unto thy hands i commend my spirit and having said thus he gave up the ghost john when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost events of the crucifiction matthew says that the veil of the temple was rent that there was an earthquake and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour that graves opened and bodies of the saints arose and went into jeruselem appearing to many beating jesus to the resurection mark and luke speak of darkness and the veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints john is the only one who mentions jesus s side being peirced burial of jesus matthew says the jews asked pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being stolen by the disciples and for the tomb to be sealed all of this was supposedly done but the other gospels do not mention these precautions how long was jesus in the tomb depends where you look matthew gives jesus prophesying that he will spend three days and three nights in the heart of the earth and mark has after three days meta treis emeras he will rise again as far as i can see from a quick look the prophecies have after three days but the post resurrection narratives have on the third day time of the resurection matthew says sunday at dawn mark says the sun was rising and john says it was dark who was at the empty tomb is it mat in the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre mar and when the sabbath was past mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and salome had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him joh the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early when it was yet dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre whom did they see at the tomb mat and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it mat his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow mat and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead men mat and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not ye for i know that ye seek jesus which was crucified mar and entering into the sepulchre they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were affrighted luk and it came to pass as they were much perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shining garments joh and seeth two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of jesus had lain belief that the disciples stole jesus s body matthew says the guard was paid to tell this story but no other gospel makes this claim appearences of the risen jesus matthew says an angel at the tomb told the two marys and that jesus also told them to tell the disciples to meet him in galilee the disciples then went to a mountain previously agreed opon and met jesus there this was his only appearance except to the women at the tomb matthew only devotes five verses to the visit with the disciples mark says that jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country and that they told the rest of the disciples who refused to believe later he appeared to the disciples at mealtime luke says two followers went the same day that jesus rose from the dead to emmaus a village eight miles from jeruselem and there jesus jioned them but was unrecognised while they ate a meal together that evening they finally recognised jesus whereopon he dissapeared returning at once to jeruselem they told the disciples of their experience and suddenly jesus appeared among them frightening them as they thought he was a spirit jesus then ate some fish and honey and then preached to them john says jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose in jeruselem where they were hiding he breathed the holy ghost opon them but thomas was not present and refused to believe eight days later jesus joined the disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced thomas once more jesus made an appearance to the disciples at the sea of tiberias but again was not recognised after telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat jesus becomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them they all eat together and converse the book of acts further adds to the confusion it says that jesus showed himself to the apostles for a period of days after his resurection thus contradicting matthew mark luke and john and spoke to them of things pertaining to the kingdom of god and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud recieved him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up two men stood by them in white apparel which also said ye men of galilee why stand ye gazing into heaven this same jesus which is taken from you into heaven shall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven acts paul outdoes every other authority by saying that jesus was seen by persons between the time of the resurection and the assension although he does not say where he also claims that he himself as one born out of due time also saw jesus cor the ascension matthew says nothing about it mark casually says that jesus was recieved into heaven after he was finished talking with the disciples in jeruselem luke says jesus led the desciples to bethany and that while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven john says nothing about it acts contradicts all of the above see previous section when second coming mat verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled mar verily i say unto you that this generation shall not pass till all these things be done luk verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled thessalonians how many apostles were in office between the resurection and ascention corinthians matthew minus one from acts mathias not elected until after resurrection mat then the eleven disciples went away into galilee into a mountain where jesus had appointed them ascend to heaven and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven kings no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven the son of man john as you can see there are a number of contradictions in the account of the trial crucifiction and resurection of jesus if these are good witnesses you would think that they could get some of these important details right in fact i cannot find very many points on where they agree you would think that they could at least agree on some of the points they were supposedly observing because of the fact that there is so much contradiction and error the story of the resurection as presented cannot be taken as literal truth due to the nature of the story i doubt if it should be taken as any sort of truth alan

after years can we say that christian morality is mc theory of creationism my theistic view of the theory of mc creationism there are many others is stated in genesis mc in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and which order of creation do you accept the story of creation is one of the many places in the bible where the story contradicts itself the following is an example gen and god made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and god saw that it was good gen and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth gen and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him an help meet for him gen and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever adam called every living creature that was the name thereof even your bible cannot agree on how things were created why should we believe in it alan

re why does illustrator autotrace so poorly mac utkvx bitnet richard j mcdougald writes since there s no not really such thing as a decent raster to vector conversion program this tracing technique is about it simple stuff like b w logos etc do pretty well while more complicated stuff goes haywire the first and only thing i ve ever tried to auto trace was a piece of a uscg nautical chart using adobe illustrator i wanted to get the outline of the coast for western long island sound i was simultaneously suprised at how good a job it did and disappointed at how poorly it did i suspect what i gave it was a very difficult thing not only is the coastline very irregular but overlaid on the chart are numerous sets of gridlines not only lattitude and longitude but loran grids as well the most common mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel and tangent to a grid line it would take off following the gridline instead of the coast i think the best improvement would be some sort of interactive algorithm that would let you step in and say no dummy you re going the wrong way steve reisberg a friend of mine a few years back did his doctoral work analysing electron micrographs of filimentous phage virii a good chunk of the work was writing a program to take a digitized micrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particles this is essentially the same problem that illustrator tries to solve with its auto trace tool in some respects the problem steve worked on was harder since he was trying to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and finding a good centerline was only the first step but a step on which all future analysis depended however in other respects it was an easier problem since the program could be written with a lot of knowledge about what the virus particles were supposed to look like and the analysis could be restricted to those particles which happend to be relatively straight clean and well imaged you don t always have that freedom auto tracing real life images in any case it gave me some insight into just how difficult this problem is to solve in the general case steve is no longer with us he and his wife disappeared while on vacation in hawaii a couple of years after they graduated their last known location was hiking in a densely wooded in a mountainous area while no bodies were ever found they are presumed to have been the victim of some sort of fall or accident in the woods roy smith roy nyu edu hippocrates project department of microbiology coles nyu school of medicine first avenue new york ny this never happened to bart simpson

re fast polygon routine needed osprey ux cso uiuc edu lucas adamski writes in article pdxgate uucp idr rigel cs pdx edu ian d romanick writes what kind of polygons shaded texturemapped hm more comes into play with fast routines than just polygons it would be nice to know exaclty what system vga is a start but what processor and a few of the specifics of the implementation you need to give more info if you want to get any answers p i don t want texture mapped cause if i did i d asked for them just a simple and fast routine to do filled polygons as for the processor it d be for a minimum of a maybe if i can t find a good one for s ideally i want a polyn function that can clip to a user defined viewport and write to an arbitrary location in memory of course the chances of ok it is for a game that is d and you have listed the characteristics that you are looking for i think you may have left out a few important parameters the polygons are all convex they have less than n sides you are drawing meshes walls doors etc i believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw concave self intersecting polygons this efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line complex figure type polygons can be a bit trickier the less than n sides specification especially if it is a very small number like or allow othe optimisations to be made thus for a high speed game application i think you are looking for code that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convex polygons finding something like that are pretty remote so i guess i d need the source with it oh and i guess it would need to be in asm otherwise it d be too slow i ve seen some polygon routines in c and they ve all been waaay too slow its for a d vector graphics program i ve been hunting high and low it may have been that they were very general purpose algorithms if you limit yourself to or four sided simple convex polygons i think you might be suprised how fast a c algorithm with a asm block move to fill each scan line might actually be for a polyn function in asm and i can t find one anywhere that i can use i ve found one or two polyn functions but my asm is pretty bad so i won t even try to rewrite them lucas

one works well and is fairly simple implementations are included in most raster toolkits see item below a variant method is described in graphics gems p note that the code from the graphics gems series is all available from an ftp site as described above check out john bradley s diversity algorithm which is incorporated into the xv package and described in the back of the manual the imagemagick package see section for where it is contains another quantizing algorithm which is presented as doing a better job than the other algorithms but slower there s also an implementation of

modified form appears in the utah raster toolkit as well converting color into grayscale the ntsc formula is luminosity red green blue quantizing grayscale to black white the only reference you need for this stuff is digital halftoning robert ulichney mit press isbn but before you go off and start coding check out the image manipulation software mentioned in item below all of the packages mentioned can do some form of gray to b w conversion rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle the obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source image transform each coordinate and copy the pixel to the destination this is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination instead loop over the pixels in the destination image apply the reverse transformation to the coordinates and copy that pixel from the source this method is quite general and can be used for any one to one d mapping not just rotation you can add anti aliasing by doing sub pixel sampling however there is a much faster method with antialising included which involves doing three shear operations the method was originally created for the im raster toolkit see below an implementation is also present in

on sci astro fits read it if you want to know more converting between vector formats a lot of people ask about converting from hpgl to postscript or macdraw to cgm or whatever it is important to understand that this is a very different problem from the image format conversions in item converting one image format to another is a fairly easy problem since once you get past all the file header junk a pixel is a pixel the basic objects are the same for all image formats this is not so for vector formats the basic objects circles ellipses drop shadowed pattern filled round cornered rectangles etc vary from one format to another except in extremely restricted cases it is simply not possible to do a one to one conversion between vector formats there is software for converting to and from cgm files on ftp psc edu the contributor states that it runs on unix ms windows and possibly the mac a better more specific blurb would be most welcome on the other hand it is quite possible to do a close approximation rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another as far as i know no one has put together a general toolkit of such converters but two different hpgl to postscript converters have been posted to comp sources misc check the index on your nearest archive site a related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format to a bitmapped image from postscript to sun raster format or hpgl to x bitmap for example some of the commercial postscript clones for pc s allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer also the postscript interpreters in the next box and in sun s x news can be used to render to a file if you re clever but in general the answer is no however if someone were to put together a vector to vector conversion toolkit adding a vector to raster converter would be trivial gnu ghostscript from the fsf current version includes drivers for both ppm and gif format files thus it can be used as a postscript to ppm or a postscript to gif filter it implements essentially all of postscript level and alot of display postscript and level how to get pixar films the various john lasseter pixar computer animated shorts are available

several days later don t expect to be able to rent a copy from your local video store according to the license agreement printed on the back cover of the case it cannot be rented how do i draw a circle as a bezier or b spline curve the short answer is you can t unless you use a rational spline you can only approximate a circle the approximation may look acceptable but it is sensitive to scale magnify the scale and the error of approximation magnifies deviations from circularity that were not visible in the small can become glaring in the large if you want to do the job right consult the article a menagerie of rational b spline circles by leslie piegl and wayne tiller in ieee computer graphics and applications volume number september pages for rough non rational approximations consult the book computational geometry for design and manufacture by i d faux and m j pratt ellis horwood publishers halsted press john wiley for the best known non rational approximations consult the

will tell you how to use it note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse how to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to infinity if it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way the point is within the polygon if the ray crosses an even number of edges the point is either outside the polygon or within an interior hole formed from intersecting polygon edges this idea is known in the trade as the jordan curve theorem see eric haines article in glassner s ray tracing book above for more information including treatment of special cases another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all the vertices on the polygon if the sum is pi the point is inside if the sum is the point is outside however this method is about an order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the trigonometric functions is usually quite costly code for both methods plus

re bit graphics a good reason which is why many companies use it for bits pixel is so you can use double buffering for animating scenes i e you have bit planes you write to the one in the background and then flip the entire screen updates to the second image plane the screen updates in one refresh and you don t see different objects appearing in the order that they re drawn as in the cad macdraw effect now your ready to update the image that used to be in the foreground steve thssstb iitmax iit edu iris iit edu about the sg product line who can even keep track nowadays every co seems to as their ads press releases claim redefine computing etc etc as we know it with each new product progress and competition are great but who wants to invest in a system that s obsolete by the time it reaches your desk

re fast polygon routine needed in article rguqoinnrc edna cc swin edu au alan saturn cs swin oz au alan christiansen writes i believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw concave self intersecting polygons this efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line complex figure type polygons can be a bit trickier it is true the convex algorithm is faster than a general concave multi outline algorithm but not tremendously faster i spent awhile implementing and optimizing both flavors and the convex turned out about faster this is all c on hp pa risc the compiler got the inner loop shooting the span as fast as possible as far as i could tell for any sort of game the database to render is known ahead of time and can be made all convex definitely the way to go p s sorry but my code cannot be made public domain jesse jesse lackey d eye inc ithaca ny jesse eye com

re tiff complexity anyone who thinks that tiff is too complex hasn t dealt with cgm asn cda dca sgml or any one of a number of other very successful file format people seem perfectly capable dealing with these others dealing with the format of tiff is frankly less difficult than dealing with the dct lzw and fax encoding of the image data the majority of the libraries which deal with tiff are dedicated to these other issues rather than with simply decoding the tags and parameters perhaps people are overwhelmed in comparison with some rather simpleminded formats such as gif pcx and bmp but to suggest that tiff is so complex as to be doomed to failure is ludicrous that doesn t mean that gif isn t fine but don t even thing about using it in many instances gif is very nice for use in low end photos applications and for screen grabs and such but it would never do for high volume or high resolution systems fax is nice but it doesn t do color and gif doesn t do b w all that well jpeg is nice for high resolution color but is slow for low end the advantage tiff brings to the table is its ability to handle all these situations and then some naturally it s more complex but i ld rather propose tiff imaging solutions over imaging systems based on having to deal with file formats anyday you may find that tiff is too complicated for your personal tastes but please don t wrail against it s complexity the complexity it contains is required to provide the functionality it does and doesn t come close to the complexity found in most commercially viable file formats if we re in philosophical arguments against complexity let s all go program in scheme and forth and do imaging with run length encoding

re raytracing colours asecchia cs uct ac za adrian secchia writes when an incident ray i strikes an object at point p the reflected ray r and the transmitted ray t is calculated from the formulae calling the routine recursively on r and t will return the colours along the rays r and t as rcol and tcol each object has its own colour ocol and each light source has licol i n the question is how do you combine rcol tcol ocol and all the licol s to get the correct resulting colour to return along the i ray first of all this is not a snide response if you re confused about this issue you will stumble over a lot of other things as well i suggest that the weakness is your reference material get an introduction to ray tracing by andrew glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing algorithm you could also refer to the nd edition of foley van dam on to the question the simple answer is that you just keep adding up all the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity for example if your intensity values range from to then keep adding up and clamp the resultant values to you might have to clamp the lower bound to if you have dark bulbs but that s another issue so you get some illumination equation like this i lambient ldiffuse light n lreflected ltransparent the contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light intensity as is the light due to transparency now a slightly less hand waving illumination equation is this i kala kdld light n krlr ktlt that is each component of the illumination equation is governed by the material constants ka kd kr and kt so the maximum you can get from transparency for a given object for example might be for a purple colored glass object hopefully this answers your question i ll forward my illumination equation sermon to you also steve hollasch kubota pacific computer inc hollasch kpc com santa clara california

scientific visualization of chemical systems molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into a international industry computer graphics has played a decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to build visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects while computer scientists are conversant in the language of their own discipline they are often unfamiliar with the terminology simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists similarly chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms and technological advances in graphical computing this interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of prepackaged graphics software although this is not intended to be a course in computational chemistry or drug design data sets from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own lab exercises and projects will be carried out using data flow programming ibm visualization data explorer software and students will have access to cornell theory center computing resources including video recording equipment audience researchers and students in the chemical and biological sciences interested in integrating state of the art computer graphics into their research computer scientists wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of scientific visualization the class size will be limited to participants on a first come first served basis

applications robotics medical satellite engineering oil exploration etc it is called hips and deals with sequences of multiband images in the same way it deals with single images it has been growing since we first wrote it both by additions from us as well as a huge user contributed library feature description hips is a set of image processing modules which together provide a powerful suite of tools for those interested in research system development and teaching it handles sequences of images movies in precisely the same manner as single frames programs and subroutines have been developed for simple image transformations filtering convolution fourier and other transform processing edge detection and line drawing manipulation digital image compression and transmission methods noise generation and image statistics computation over such image transformation programs have been developed as a result almost any image processing task can be performed quickly and conveniently additionally hips allows users to easily integrate their own custom routines new users become effective using hips on their first day hips features images that are self documenting each image stored in the system contains a history of the transformations that have been applied to that image hips includes a small set of subroutines which primarily deals with a standardized image sequence header and a large library of image transformation tools in the form of unix filters it comes complete with source code on line manual pages and on line documentation host configuration requirements originally developed at new york university hips now represents one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image processing environments currently available it runs under the unix operating system it is modular and flexible provides automatic documentation of its actions and is almost entirely independent of special equipment hips is now in use on a variety of computers including vax and microvax sun apollo masscomp ncr tower iris ibm at etc for image display and input drivers are supplied for the grinnell and adage ikonas image processors and the sun sun sun and sun i consoles we also supply user contributed drivers for a number of other framestores and windowing packages sun gfx sun console matrox vip iti ip lexidata macintosh ii x windowing system and iris the hipsaddon

general purpose packages i ve heard of besides what terramar has sips was written for aviris imagery i m not sure how general purpose it is you would have to contact goetz or one of his people and ask i have another piece of software pcw that does pc and walsh transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image modification you can compute an image using selected components i ve used it on megabyte aviris images without problems but for the best speed you need an external dsp card it will work without it but large images take quite a while times as long to process that s a freebie if you want it my favorite is idl interactive data language from research systems inc idl is in my opinion much better and infinitely easier its programming language is very strong and easy very pascal like it handles the number crunching very well also personally i like doing the number crunching with idl on the vax or mathematica igor or even excel on the mac if it s not too hairy then bringing it over to nih image for the imaging part i have yet to encounter any situation which that combination couldn t handle and the speed and ease of use compared to iraf was incredible by the way it s mostly astronomical image processing which i ve been doing this means image enhancement cleaning up bad lines pixels and some other traditional image processing routines then for example taking a

intergraph workstations a unix machine similar to a sun though there were rumors there are always rumors that the software would be ported to pc and possibly a sun environment pci a company called pci inc out of richmond hill ontario canada makes an array of software utilities for processing manipulation and use of remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard formats lgsowg bsq landsat and a couple of others whose titles i forget the software is available in versions for ms dos unix workstations among them hp sun and ibm and vms and quite possibly other platforms by now i use the vms version the pci software consists of several classes groups packages of utilities grouped by function but all operating on a common pci database disk file the tape i o package is a set of utility programs which read from the various remote sensing industry tape formats into or write those formats out from the pci database file this is the only package i use or know much about other packages can display data from the pci database to one or another of several pci supported third party color displays output numeric or bitmap representation of image data to an attached printer e g an epson type dot matrix graphics printer you might be more spe cifically interested in the mathematical operations package histo gram and fourier analysis equalization user specified operations e g multiply channel by add channel and store as channel and god only knows what all else there s a lot i don t have and don t use these so can t say much about them you only buy the packages your particular application interest calls for each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters read from a common parameter file which must be in vms anyway in your default directory some utilities will share parameters and use the same parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing setting up a series of operations the standard pci environment contains a scripting language very similar to ibm pc basic but which allows you to automate the process of setting up parameters for a common complicated lengthy or difficult series of utility executions in vms i can also invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure there s also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled language programs which can interface with read from write to the pci data structures database file parameter file the pci software is designed specifically for remote sensing images but requires such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the level where you can handle r s images you can figure out ways to handle a few other things as well for instance the tape i o package offers a utility for reading headerless multi band what adobe photoshop on the macintosh calls raw data from tape in a number of different interleave orders this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the graphic arts industry s ct t format would probably i haven t tried handle targa and so on above all however you have to know what you re doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start over it s worth noting that the pci database file is designed to contain not only raster image data but vectors for overlaying map information entered via digitizing table land use and all manner of other information i observe that a remote sensing image tape often contains all manner of information about the spectral bands latitude longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass all of this can go into the pci database i believe that on workstations the built in display is used on vax systems other than workstations pci supports only a couple of specific third party display systems the name gould deanza seems to come to mind one of my personal workarounds was a display program which would display directly from a pci database file to a peritek vct q q bus bit directcolor display subsystem pci software could be overkill in your case it seems designed for the very high end applications users i e those for whom a mac pc largely doesn t suffice although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time it s probably no coincidence that pci is located in canada a country which does a lot of its land resource management via remote sensing i believe the canadian government uses pci software for some of its work in these areas spam spectral analysis manager back in jpl developed something called spam spectral analysis manager which got a fair amount of use at the time that was designed for airborne imaging spectrometer imagery byte data pixels across by lines by bands a modified version has since been developed for aviris airborne visual and infrared imaging spectrometer which uses much larger images spam does none of these things rectification classification pc and ihs transformations filtering contrast enhancement overlays actually it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement stretching spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering the original spam uses x or sunview to display the aviris version may require vicar an executive based on tae and may also require a frame buffer i can refer you to people if you re interested pcw requires x for display map ii among the mac gis systems map ii is distributed by john wiley clrview clrview is a dimensional visualization

need help z buffering lines areas together i m asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low apparent precision in z buffering that i ve encountered in different pex implementations i can t find any discussion of this problem in any resources i can lay hands on e g the comp windows x pex faq gaskins s pexlib programming manual vendors documentation i m posting this article by itself on comp graphics and virtually the same article with a test program demonstrating the problem on comp windows x pex the problem is hard to describe without pictures hence this article is longish if you can run pexlib x programs and are interested i encourage you to build and run the test program in comp windows x pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach to dealing with it it depends on the utility code from the above gaskins book instructions for fetching it via anonymous ftp are given the problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize stitching artifacts resulting from the use of z buffering with polylines that are coplanar with filled areas the interpolated z values along a line will differ slightly due to roundoff error from the interpolated z values across an area even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with vertices of the area because of this it s a tossup whether the z buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed visually the result tends to be a dashed line effect even though the line is supposed to be solid using the pexlib api my approach to a solution is to use two slightly different pex view mapping transforms in two view table entries one for the areas and one for the lines the pex structures or immediate mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in effect for areas and the other is always in effect for lines the result is a slight shift in npc z coordinates for the lines so as to attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines this shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used in the pexlib view table entry for lines just a hair backwards i e smaller vrc z coordinates compared to their positions in the view table entry used for areas this means that when a point is transformed to npc its z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than if it comes from an area thus accomplishing the desired bias i would expect the z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount to a few units at most out of the entire dynamic range of the z buffer typically from to if not i e or bit z buffers therefore it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of z in vrc between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix the stitching but in fact experience shows that the shift has to be as much as to of the range empirically it s worst when the npc z component of the slope of the surface is high i e when it appears more or less edge on to the viewer it s as if only or bits of the z buffer have any dependable meaning this amount is so great that one problem is replaced by another sometimes the polylines show through areas which they are supposed to lie behind i ve observed the problem on both hewlett packard and digital workstation pex servers to approximately the same degree the test program demonstrates the problem on an mit pexlib x implementation this version is known to compile and run on an hp ux system with pex open questions why does this happen am i configuring the pex view table wrongly is there a systematic difference in z interpolation for lines as opposed to areas e g pixel centers versus corners which could be corrected for are pex implementors wantonly discarding z precision in their interpolators something else what to do about it can i fix my use of the view table to allow better precision in z buffered hlhsr is there another approach i can take to remove the stitching artifacts am i just out of luck any help would be immensely appreciated dave gorgen internet gorgen ann arbor applicon slb com applicon inc gorgen aaaca sinet slb com ann arbor michigan usa uucp uunet sharkey applga gorgen

tangent vectors of kochanek bartels splines i m working on a system which uses a given set of d key frame positions x y z to control an imaginary camera movement i m using kochanek bartels splines as described in the siggraph proceedings to create a variable number of inbetweens between the key frames i want the inbetweens to be given in the form x y z dx dy dz where the last three argumentsa are the x y and z component of the viewing direction vector of the camera when positioned at x y z the method presented by kochanek and bartels only deals with the positions of the inbetween view points to be generated i ve tried to set the viewing direction at a view point equal to the chord between the two adjacent view points which in general are not key frames but this causes a sligt discontinuity of the viewing direction vector at the key frame positions although the spatial movement seems to work fine and i m quite certain i think that i ve not simply made an implementation error now i wonder if anyone out there has used this spline form for similar purposes and how they decided the viewing vectors i d appreciate replies to be emailed to me at iharkest lise unit no anyone else interested in the answer will be sent a summary of the replies if they contact me n g e a r k e s t a d iharkest lise unit no comp sc nth norwegian institute of technology some people play hard to get i play hard to want ford fairlane
re need help z buffering lines areas together david gorgen writes i m asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low apparent precision in z buffering that i ve encountered in different pex implementations i can t find any discussion of this problem in any resources i can lay hands on e g the comp windows x pex faq gaskins s pexlib programming manual vendors documentation the problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize stitching artifacts resulting from the use of z buffering with polylines that are coplanar with filled areas the interpolated z values along a line will differ slightly due to roundoff error from the interpolated z values across an area even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with vertices of the area because of this it s a tossup whether the z buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed visually the result tends to be a dashed line effect even though the line is supposed to be solid using the pexlib api my approach to a solution is to use two slightly different pex view mapping transforms in two view table entries one for the areas and one for the lines the pex structures or immediate mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in effect for areas and the other is always in effect for lines the result is a slight shift in npc z coordinates for the lines so as to attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines this shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used in the pexlib view table entry for lines just a hair backwards i e smaller vrc z coordinates compared to their positions in the view table entry used for areas this means that when a point is transformed to npc its z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than if it comes from an area thus accomplishing the desired bias i would expect the z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount to a few units at most out of the entire dynamic range of the z buffer typically from to if not i e or bit z buffers therefore it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of z in vrc between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix the stitching but in fact experience shows that the shift has to be as much as to of the range empirically it s worst when the npc z component of the slope of the surface is high i e when it appears more or less edge on to the viewer it s as if only or bits of the z buffer have any dependable meaning this amount is so great that one problem is replaced by another sometimes the polylines show through areas which they are supposed to lie behind i ve observed the problem on both hewlett packard and digital workstation pex servers to approximately the same degree the test program demonstrates the problem on an mit pexlib x implementation this version is known to compile and run on an hp ux system with pex open questions why does this happen am i configuring the pex view table wrongly is there a systematic difference in z interpolation for lines as opposed to areas e g pixel centers versus corners which could be corrected for are pex implementors wantonly discarding z precision in their interpolators something else what to do about it can i fix my use of the view table to allow better precision in z buffered hlhsr is there another approach i can take to remove the stitching artifacts am i just out of luck we here at ibm have the same problem with our workstations i was also shocked when i first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by about bits assuming bit z buffer this seems huge but is only of the dynamic range in those terms it doesn t seem so bad what is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear due mainly to roundoff i believe so the polygon is not planar in z but is more like a ruffles potato chip ditto with lines when you start end at different x y values the ridges are out of phase resulting in the stitch effect you have the same problem if you try to draw polygon right on top of another but with different vertices you will likely see a smeared effect where they overlap example try polygon polygon your implementation is correct in fact we do a similar trick when rendering primitives that have lines and polygons such as nurbs surfaces with isoparametric lines without the trick the lines appear stitched as you say when the application draws lines polygons independently the system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting so the application must do it this is what you have discovered and are doing bravo note to ibm ers the information given here has been previously disclosed through proper channels so i m not giving away any new unpublished info mark einkauf einkauf austin ibm com ibm advanced workstations and systems graphics systems austin tx views and opinions expressed herein are not necessarily those of ibm corp
virtual sound i m looking for algorithms or articles on virtual sound what i want to do is the following from a fast source eg a cdrom several sound sources are read each having it s own defined position and other attributes eg direction etc given the listeners position and direction the sum of sound played back in each of the listeners earphones will be a function of this position and direction this means that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it s incoming direction have to be done for each sound source i think this is possible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles relative to each ear and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given angle this impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the source this impulse function must be changed every time some sound source changes position or the listener changes orientation additionally some reflection diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined could be simulated but this requires some sort of sound propagandation simulation kinda like some radiosity algorithm have someone done this and or written articles on implementing such a system please post or mail any answers or comments torgeir veimo studying at the university of bergen i m gona wave my freak flag high jimi hendrix and it would be okay on any other day the police

d widget wish list i am very interested in hearing from all of you who are using or implementing d interactive applications what types of d widgets you would like to have in your applications a d widget is usually located in the same scene as other d objects of the application it may let you manipulate application data the camera d objects in the scene and so on or view the status of the application or d objects via the widget s shape color position orientation and so on or do whatever i missed but you think is possible for example a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball shown as a partially transparent sphere super imposed on the object to be rotated a feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to objects the length of the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the ruler indicating the distance a widget can provide both manipulation and feedback for example the ruler can be used to change the distance between the objects along its own axis please e mail me or post your opinions on d interaction the information i gathered will help me design a d ui construction tool your help is very much appreciated tony lau tlau cs ubc ca m sc student dept of computer science

kubota vs e s freedome more people have been asking for information on the kubota graphics workstations so here is some more info on the kenai denali vs the e s freedom here is the text of a denali vs e s freedom done by d h brown associates denali bears a strong resemblance to evans and sutherlands freedom graphics subsystem in several aspects of its high level design both products use a parallel array of processors for geometric computations both have a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of pixel processors as a result denali and freedome overlap significantly in performance and functionality both design teams also appear to have similar philosophies with respect to modularity scalability and market penetration there remain however several important differences between the kpc and e s products evans and sutherland designed freedom as a high end developer s dream system with plenty of performance potential and flexibility in its favor freedom has configurations from two to sixteen floating point units a border range that starts and ends at a higher price and performance levels than denali all freedom systems include a large fixed number of pixel processors that support a broader variety of color blending functions the freedom design treats its entire image memory as general purpose memory allowing developers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special purpose applications finally e s provided freedom with very flexible otput and video integration features for multimedia and simulation applications note that kpc is working an auxiliary board for ntsc and pal output that will not require an external video encoder e s programmable output features however will remain much more flexible the kpc design team in contrast made denali more of an end user s system entry version have better performance range and flexibility than low end freedom configurations and come in at more realistic mainstream price points denali does not need as many modules as freedome because it uses a deeper scan conversion pipeline to support each one resulting in better cost performance characteristics although both products provide strong support for d imaging and volume rendering kpc recognized that not all users will want an even mix of these capabilities denali s configuration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase geometric and pixel processing capabilities separately and to upgrade them separately as needed both companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at workstation price levels as a way to attack sgi s more expensive vgxt and realityengine systems the only other products to provide this capability kpc supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation of textures in hardware but provides only software support for the higher qualtiy tri linear interpolated mipmapping method on balance however denali provideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than e s for most applications aside from being much more affordable kpc solutions deliver more parallelism for texture processing and more off screen memory for general graphics data storage by implementing texture mapping on its transformation modules e s foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels to obtain better texturing performance kubota avoids this problem by linking texturing to its frame buffer modules providing a lower cost more scalable solution hope this helps brian ps this was reprinted without permission for the full text please contact kubota
re xv problems in article apr nessie mcc ac uk c c lilley mcc ac uk writes yes xv is an bit program this is not a bug never claimed it is a bug xv can import bit images and quantises them down to bits this is a handy facility not a bug never claimed it is a bug how would you suggest doing colour editing on a bit file how would you group related colours to edit them together only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated if you want to do colour editing on a bit image you need much more powerfull software which is readily available commercially i guess i edited my note on this away from the article i posted to many newsgroups i wrote something about making color modifications quickly with bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the bit image this makes sense because the main use of xv is only viewing images doing many changes to image we should keep all modifications in a buffer and then before making the operations to bit image we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations and lastly jpeg is a compression algorithm it can be applied to any image of arbitrary bit depth again this is not a bug never claimed it is a bug i tried kept sure i don t claim that jpeg is noting else than a compression algorithm because i know what the jpeg is you propably misunderstood what i wrote as you have done in many places so far you also missed what is were wrong with xv however i did wrote it juhana kouhia

re xv problems in article apr nessie mcc ac uk c c lilley mcc ac uk writes in article rohjc avt cc tut fi jk lehtori cc tut fi kouhia juhana writes i wrote something about making color modifications quickly with bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the bit image this makes sense because the main use of xv is only viewing images doing many changes to image we should keep all modifications in a buffer and then before making the operations to bit image we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations think about what you are saying here the bit image is quantised down to bits so many similar colours are mapped onto a single palette colour this colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways you then want to apply these modifications back to the bit file so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette colour i suppose you don t know what about we have discussed we discussed about error s in xv which shows images only as bit and my suggestion above works perfectly with it so far i have seen a colormap editing window in xv that is there must be a colormap anyway the problems you present are exist anyway and i didn t tried to solve them at all because i would not make such problems to my programs in the first place gamma and color corrections are easily done to bit image as i presented there s no need make tricks from bit quantized image back to bit image how would you suggest doing colour editing on a bit file how would you group related colours to edit them together only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated ok you re writing about situation that user want edit images as bit and user want edit individual colors your questions by the way jumps off the discussion a bit my solution doesn t work because there s no colormap withing real bit image you see user see bit image going back to bit is silly about changing individual colors in bit quantized rasterized image changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the image xv allows this feature but i don t recommend to use it with the mentioned type images moreover xv is not a paint program you can only make those global changes in full bit xv changing individual colors sounds like paint program job if person have bit screen there s need for tricks to get the original bit image modified because user don t see full bit image there s need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups if image is rasterized to select indiavidual color there could be x cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area selecting individual color is possible from that ok i don t have thought very much bit painting programs never seen such in good view and are not planned to make such not to mention bit painting program in bit screen yes again what is was wrong with xv it saved bit quantized rasterized images as bit jpegs jpeg is not designed for that also human expect that bit will be saved as bit image say person would like to crop part of the image and save it then it is expected that the image still is the same so xv were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work design error i have heard xv were designed first for bit images files but it were not good idea to take full bit images without making major change to the original design so even all screen images are bit the processed images and saved images could have been bit very easily instead of bit before anybody will make a note yes i may as well make a lift where up means that the lift goes down and down means that the lift goes up and put a note on this design solution to the manuals however even the manuals tells the correct situation it doesn t solve the problem americans the lift is just an example well my text may be a bit hard reading hopefully you suggeeded to read it juhana kouhia

re tiff complexity in article aa enet gw pa dec com you write anyone who thinks that tiff is too complex hasn t dealt with cgm asn cda dca sgml or any one of a number of other very successful file format people seem perfectly capable dealing with these others well yeah but unlike tiff they all do substantially more than encode rectangular bitmaps and the others are hardly trouble free i hear that it is quite common for cgm implementations not to interoperate the annoying thing about tiff is that is that along with the useful options there are stupid options the most egregious example is that rather than picking a byte order and bit order and using it consistently in all tiff files byte and bit order are options and all tiff readers on all machines no matter what their natural byte order have to be prepared to do byte swapping there are four slightly different fax formats again any one of them would have been adequate rgb images can be stored by pixel or by component complexity without function etc etc i also note that the tiff doc says that aldus experiments show that lzw reliably compresses as well or better than any of the fax formats suggesting that none of the fax formats are really useful what s worse a lot of the formats aren t even implemented very well e g lzw limits code words to bits while or bits would have provided substantially better compression and the lzw method compresses bytes rather than pixels but the absolute worst thing about tiff is that any vendor can register proprietary tiff codes and formats without even publicly documenting them this means that there is no way to write a tiff reader that can reliably read all incoming tiff files some standard regards john levine johnl iecc cambridge ma us spdcc ima world iecc johnl

lcd vga display please help i have an ibm compatible notebook computer with an lcd vga screen while i was working with it this morning the screen started to flicker a little which i thought was odd since i do use a surge protector for my computer and all peripherals it only did this for a second and then stopped i left the room for several minutes and when i returned the screen was completely dim not blank but very very dim the contrast slider still worked so that i could adjust it to where i could faintly make out what was on the screen but the brightness slider had absolutely no effect i was plugged in at the time i e not using the battery but i still tried switching the battery changing the power saver features etc etc all to no avail has anyone else experienced anything like this if this just means that i need to replace the screen then i guess i ll have to but i thought that the death of my lcd screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventually happened i didn t want to take it in to be repaired before i asked on the net about this because i already know what they ll say yep you gotta have this replaced and it s gonna cost you i ve only had the computer for about months is that a reasonable life cycle for a lcd display oh i guess i ought to give specifics here the brand is compudyne is this a reputable company it s a sx mhz i forget the model number exactly and i was too ticked off to write it down before coming in to work today if anyone can help me please give me any advice you might have i m not opposed to having it replaced but i d rather not if it s not absolutely necessary if you wouldn t mind please e mail me at mike mik uky edu but if you d rather post i ll be checking back here in a couple of days btw if the answer to this question is already in a faq somewhere feel free to flame away but i would ask that you also include the location and name of the faq if you don t mind thanks in advance for any help mike mattone mike mik uky edu

oh make up your mind was re xv problems in article rqisi rhj cc tut fi jk lehtori cc tut fi kouhia juhana writes in article apr nessie mcc ac uk c c lilley mcc ac uk writes in article rohjc avt cc tut fi jk lehtori cc tut fi kouhia juhana writes i wrote something about making color modifications quickly with bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the bit image this makes sense because the main use of xv is only viewing images doing many changes to image we should keep all modifications in a buffer and then before making the operations to bit image we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations think about what you are saying here the bit image is quantised down to bits so many similar colours are mapped onto a single palette colour this colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways you then want to apply these modifications back to the bit file so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette colour i suppose you don t know what about we have discussed we discussed about error s in xv which shows images only as bit and my suggestion above works perfectly with it look be consistent first you post something that seems to suggest that you see xv being an bit program as some sort of error so i post and asy it is not a bug it is meant to be like that so you post and say it is not a bug you never said it was i have misunderstood etc now you are saying we discussed about error s in xv which shows images only as bit if you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the discussion a lot easier so far i have seen a colormap editing window in xv that is there must be a colormap anyway the problems you present are exist anyway and i didn t tried to solve them at all because i would not make such problems to my programs in the first place eh sorry i don t understand what you are saying here i am aware that english is not your native language and have tried hard to fathom your meaning but this paragraph defeats me gamma and color corrections are easily done to bit image as i presented there s no need make tricks from bit quantized image back to bit image yes as i originally said global changes are easily possible but this statement contradicts what you said earlier i wrote something about making color modifications quickly with bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the bit image how would you suggest doing colour editing on a bit file how would you group related colours to edit them together only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated ok you re writing about situation that user want edit images as bit and user want edit individual colors your questions by the way jumps off the discussion a bit no i don t think so actually you were talking about loading a bit image into xv by quantising manipulating the colours in the colour editor then somewhow applying these changes to the bit file when you exit xv xv lets you edit individual colours where is this sudden jumping off the topic my solution doesn t work because there s no colormap withing real bit image yes i am aware there is no colourmap in a bit file you see user see bit image going back to bit is silly i do not understand what this statement is supposed to mean about changing individual colors in bit quantized rasterized image changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the image what are you saying xv allows this feature but i don t recommend to use it with the mentioned type images ah now we see thew problem first you want to extend xv to allow editing of bit previews of bit images then i point out problems with this now you are saying there is no problem because you personally happen not to use those parts of the program that cause the problem moreover xv is not a paint program you can only make those global changes not sure what you are saying here certainly one can make local changes in full bit xv changing individual colors sounds like paint program job if person have bit screen there s need for tricks to get the original bit image modified because user don t see full bit image there s need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups if image is rasterized to select indiavidual color there could be x cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area selecting individual color is possible from that yes that is one possible approach i would find a program that took such an approach clumsy however ok i don t have thought very much bit painting programs never seen such in good view and are not planned to make such not to mention bit painting program in bit screen well here we agree you have not thought it through very much you don t seem to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the next ok we all have off days perhaps you should step back and think this one through yes again what is was wrong with xv it saved bit quantized rasterized images as bit jpegs jpeg is not designed for that as i said in the last post jpeg is a compression algorithm it is a way of saving disk space by trading off quality against compression i fail to see what the problem is you have not proposed any workable alternatives also human expect that bit will be saved as bit image speak for yourself you are the only person i have met or spoken to who having quantised a bit image down to bits expects this process to somehow reverse when the file is saved keeping all modificvations that heve been made to the bit image palette perhaps that is why you yused the singular say person would like to crop part of the image and save it then it is expected that the image still is the same look next time you import a bit image into xv look carefully at the main control panel it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the bit image xv makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original bit file you are the only person who claims this is confusing so xv were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work design error is a design error the same as a bug read my lips xv is a program for viewing and modifying bit images it lets you import other images it shows i would say a good deal of thought about the human interface and everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it was designed for it makes no false claims i have heard xv were designed first for bit images files but it were not good idea to take full bit images without making major change to the original design if you would come up with a solid logical well argued and lucid description of precisely how these proposed extensions would work feel free to post them so far you have not done so so even all screen images are bit the processed images and saved images could have been bit very easily instead of bit argh after all this a comment like that very easily ok go ahead and code it if it is so easy or alternatively look up the terms import and non reversible transformation before anybody will make a note yes i may as well make a lift where up means that the lift goes down and down means that the lift goes up and put a note on this design solution to the manuals however even the manuals tells the correct situation it doesn t solve the problem americans the lift is just an example i think this is a bit of an exageration what you are actually saying is you got into a lift elevator if you are in the states and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up everyone else had no problem now you are trying to sue the manufacturer well my text may be a bit hard reading you bet hopefully you suggeeded to read it mostly leaving aside the language issue however it betrays some very wooly thinking as you yourself admit which is the same in any language go think some more chris lilley technical author itti computer graphics and

full color image editor for sgi workstations i am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on sgi gl besides typical touchup tasks such as crop rotate smooth etc bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image the following is the relevant sections from the man page pre release of may bit l name bit bitmap image touchup for sgi workstations description bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on silicon graphics gl as a full color program bit handles images of both bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner as an image viewer bit allows list of images to be displayed in their original type bits or color index in any order and in any of the many built in styles of display you can walk up and down the list using mouse and keyboard or you can let bit do the walk for you the slideshow with the pan and zoom features large images can be viewed in full without being limited by the window or screen size as an image editor bit performs a large number of image editing and processing tasks accurately and efficiently it keeps information loss at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and or quantization of input images you can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into another in addition arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take advantage of the higher printer resolutions e g postscript bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be accessed by a press of a button and best of all the processed image will be read back and displayed immediately convolution using exter nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically giving great flexibility in processing an image features bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a continuous progress report and once the processing is complete the processed image will be displayed current features include o rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti aliasing and filling the rotated out region with an arbitrary color o scales an image by arbitrary factors in x and or y directions with the option of subpixel sampling o renders text of arbitrary color size or orientation on top of an image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving the text and raster separately such as into a postscript file to take advantage of a higher printer resolution besides normal text strings many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as in tex e g alpha small beta produces greek alphabet alpha followed by a slightly smaller greek alphabet beta o presents graphically the histogram of an image o performs arbitrary to pixel transformation the transformation function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary forms further the transformation can be applied to rgb channels separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of it many difficult tasks such as thresholding can be accomplished rather easily by to transformation in combination with the avai lability of graphical histograms of the image o places simple geometric figures sgfs e g arrows circles trian gles etc of arbitrary color size and orientation into an image at arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some user definable coordinate system units with the option of rendering directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately e g postscript file all sgfs can be scaled in x and y directions independently or simultaneously this is how to get an ellipse from a circle o performs edge detection in combination with image histograms and to transformation very accurate result can be obtained o performs histogram equalization o performs convolution with externally defined square matrices of arbitrary order o crops a rectangular portion of an image o cuts and pastes across images o magnifies any portion of an image by any amount o displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause interval between images slideshow o measures rgb intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels along an arbitrary line with the result presented as rgb intensities or as an intensity vs distance plot o performs image type conversions o converts image formats o smoothes an image special convolution o filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image back and display it o modify an individual pixel s rgb values o performs fft on the entire image or a portion of it and display the resulting power spectra o spray and brush paint in full color unavailable in this pre release supported formats o iris rgb native to sgi iris o jpeg jfif format o compuserv gif o pnm portable any map including ppm pgm and pbm o xbm x window bitmap o tiff o postscript write only hardware requirements any sgi workstation that supports rgbmode including indigoes where to get it anonymous ftp to monte svec uh edu pub bit bitxxx tar z where xxx is the version number current version is read src readme for installation instructions after unpacking acknowledgement jpeg support is based on the independent jpeg groups s library version forms library developed by mark overmars is used for gui both jpeg and forms library are included in this release bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate images the built in editing features will satisfy most of your editing needs in addition the external filter and dynamical kernel will utilize any program you already have so try it and you will like it as always any comments bug reports are welcome

where did the hacker ethic go a great many computer programmers read dr dobb s journal in a recent issue there was a paragraph in an article that pained me greatly to read it said there s nothing wrong if microsoft setting the standards for the computer industry the industry needs an ibm for the s where has the hacker ethic gone not the cracker ethic which is something entirely different and bad but the hacker ethic which tells us to value the free distribution of information and yield to the hands on imperative why is it that people and corporations like bill gates ibm and intel are able to have a virtual dead lock on the computer industry why is it that if a person like myself posts messages to usenet on how to get into the little nooks crannies and idiosyncrasies of a computer system they are not given any useful information by those who know just a badmouthing or are completely ignored why is it that people like steve jobs have to abandon their efforts to make truly innovative products i ask those of you who call yourselves hackers why is this and further how can you let it go on it is a fact that the computer industry has changed the world and shall continue to do so for a long time to come it has allowed the propagation of information in a volume unheard of even twenty years ago and has made this world even smaller than it was before i shudder to think what that world will be like if the corporations are allowed to have their way perpetuating more drivel like the windows and the ibm product line on the computer using public that is not to say i am against business per se people who profit off of innovative intelligent creative designs do not bother me in fact i applaud it that is the american way but those who manage to sell kludgy uncreative systems to the public and profit off of them are the ones who are the problem and unfortunately because they have enough money to make up for blunt stupidity they can keep doing it for a very long time i put it to you thus where has the hacker ethic gone if it still exists where and if it does exist why are those who call themselves hackers allowing this to perpetuate itself why are they not creating new innovative interesting ideas to stop the sos from maintaining its choke hold on the computer industry i await with interest what will probably be a resounding silence pstlb acad alaska edu revenge is a dish best served cold szechuan death khan singh star trek ii the wrath of khan

on separate lines if you don t get a reply the server may be misreading your return address add a line such as path myname mysite to specify your correct e mail address to reply to what is jpeg jpeg pronounced jay peg is a standardized image compression mechanism jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard jpeg is designed for compressing either full color or gray scale digital images of natural real world scenes it does not work so well on non realistic images such as cartoons or line drawings jpeg does not handle black and white bit per pixel images nor does it handle motion picture compression standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named jbig and mpeg respectively jpeg is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn t quite identical to what you originally put in the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details aren t perceived as well as small details of light and dark thus jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans if you plan to machine analyze your images the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality you can make extremely small files if you don t mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc conversely if you aren t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression why use jpeg there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store bit per pixel color data instead of bit per pixel data making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images being able to compress a mbyte full color file down to kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time if you are comparing gif and jpeg the size ratio is more like four to one more details below if your viewing software doesn t support jpeg directly you ll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images even with a jpeg capable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance thus using jpeg is essentially a time space tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply it s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file i ll let you do the arithmetic yourself the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information bits pixel million colors instead of or less or fewer colors if you have only bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you within a couple of years though bit gif will look as obsolete as black and white macpaint format does today furthermore for reasons detailed in section jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images gif is superior in image quality file size or both one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to as a rule of thumb jpeg is superior to gif for storing full color or gray scale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material jpeg is superior even if you don t have bit display hardware and it is a lot superior if you do see section for details gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings in particular large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif jpeg can t squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects this sort of image is best kept in gif form in particular single color borders are quite cheap in gif files but they should be avoided in jpeg files jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pure black pixels adjacent to a row of pure white pixels for example sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in gif files borders overlaid text etc the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that s only a few pixels high if you have a gif with a lot of small size overlaid text don t jpeg it computer drawn images ray traced scenes for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity the more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same goes for semi realistic artwork fantasy drawings and such plain black and white two level images should never be converted to jpeg you need at least about gray levels before jpeg is useful for gray scale images it should also be noted that gif is lossless for gray scale images of up to levels while jpeg is not if you have an existing library of gif images you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg you will lose a little image quality if you do section which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif only applies if both formats start from a full color original if you start from a gif you ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg can only make things worse however the disk space savings may justify converting anyway this is a decision you ll have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section for hints be prepared to leave some images in gif format since some gifs will not convert well how well does jpeg compress images pretty darn well here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy a x full color image of a ship in a harbor the first three files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section b file size in bytes comments ship ppm original file in ppm format no compression bits or bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead ship ppm z ppm file passed through unix compress compress doesn t accomplish a lot you ll note other text oriented compressors give similar results ship gif converted to gif with ppmquant fs ppmtogif most of the savings is the result of losing color info gif saves bits pixel not see sec ship jpg cjpeg q highest useful quality setting this is indistinguishable from the bit original at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs ship jpg cjpeg q default setting you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original even with both on screen at once ship jpg cjpeg q this has slight defects if you know what to look for you could tell it s been jpeged without seeing the original still as good image quality as many recent postings in usenet pictures groups ship jpg cjpeg q jpeg s characteristic blockiness becomes apparent at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some still i ve seen plenty of usenet postings that were of poorer image quality than this ship jpg o cjpeg q optimize optimize cuts table overhead blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or indexing purposes note that this file is tiny the compression ratio from the original is in this case jpeg can make a file that s a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality the q file is every bit as good as the gif better if you have a full color display this seems to be a typical ratio for real world scenes what are good quality settings for jpeg most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings quality does not mean keep of the information as some have claimed the quality scale is purely arbitrary it s not a percentage of anything the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb the default quality setting q is very often the best choice this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image try q first if you see defects then go up except for experimental purposes never go above q saying q will produce a file two or three times as large as q but of hardly any better quality if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to q without objectionable degradation on the other hand you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg the default q is about right for compressing bit images but q to is usually better for converting gifs see section for more info if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are prepared to tolerate large defects a q setting in the range of to is about right q or so may be amusing as op art note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section b and to many programs based on it other jpeg implementations such as image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale some programs don t even provide a numeric scale just high medium low style choices where can i get jpeg software most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp if you don t know how to use ftp see the faq article how to find sources if you don t have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail servers in the same article that article appears regularly in news answers or you can get it by sending e mail to mail server rtfm mit edu with send usenet news answers finding sources in the body the anonymous ftp list faq may also be helpful it s usenet news answers ftp list faq in the news answers archive note this list changes constantly if you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest jpeg faq from the news answers archive a if you are looking for canned software viewers etc the first part of this list is system specific programs that only run on one kind of system if you don t see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet but some commercial programs are listed too x windows xv shareware is an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and many other image formats it can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations it s available for ftp from export lcs mit edu file contrib xv tar z version is a major upgrade with support for bit displays and many other improvements however it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking if you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge stick with version also available from export note that version is not a good choice if you have a bit display you ll get only bit color nor for converting bit images to jpeg but works fine for converting gif and other bit images to jpeg caution there is a glitch in version be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a jpeg file or the file will be blurry another good choice for x windows is john cristy s free imagemagick package also available from export lcs mit edu file contrib imagemagick tar z this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks the imagemagick viewer handles bit displays correctly for colormapped displays it does better though slower color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software both of the above are large complex packages if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release xloadimage is free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xloadimage tar z xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg files because it has the ijg v decoder while xloadimage is using a hacked over v the next xloadimage release will fix this xli is also free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xli tar z both programs are said to do the right thing with bit displays ms dos this covers plain dos for windows or os programs see the next headings one good choice is eric praetzel s free dvpeg which views jpeg and gif files the current version is available by ftp from sunee uwaterloo ca file pub jpeg viewers dvpeg zip this is a good basic viewer that works on either or machines the user interface is not flashy but it s functional another freeware jpeg gif tga viewer is mohammad rezaei s hiview the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics hv zip hiview requires a or better cpu and a vcpi compatible memory manager qemm and max work windows and os do not hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen for larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen rather than using panning scrolling as most viewers do you may or may not prefer this approach but there s no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably note installation is a bit tricky read the directions carefully a shareware alternative is colorview for dos this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives its user interface is also much spiffier looking although personally i find it harder to use more keystrokes inconsistent behavior it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview at least on my hardware for images larger than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than hiview the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics dcview zip requires a vesa graphics driver if you don t have one look in vesadrv zip or vesa tsr zip from the same directory many recent pcs have a built in vesa driver so don t try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing a second shareware alternative is fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but i don t know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel archives at that time the well known gif viewer compushow cshow supports jpeg in its latest revision a however cshow s jpeg implementation isn t very good it s slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is poor except on hi color displays too bad it d have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow shareware available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos gif cshw a zip due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine if you can t get any of them to work you ll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif then view with your favorite gif viewer if you have hi color hardware don t use gif as the intermediate format try to find a targa capable viewer instead vpic is reputed to do the right thing with hi color displays the independent jpeg group s free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics jpeg zip or jpeg zip if you have a and extended memory these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section b they will convert jpeg to and from gif targa and ppm formats handmade software offers free jpeg gif conversion tools gif jpg jpg gif these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format in particular you can t get bit color output from a jpeg the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsi s proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenet standard jfif format since hsi format files are rather widespread on bbses this is a useful capability version of these tools is free prior versions were shareware get it from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics gif jpg zip note do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet since it is not readable on non pc platforms handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package image alchemy this will translate jpeg files both jfif and hsi formats to and from many other image formats it can also display images a demo version of image alchemy version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics alch zip note about simtel the internet s key archive site for pc related programs is simtel full name wsmr simtel army mil simtel runs a non unix system with weird directory names where this document refers to directory eg msdos graphics at simtel that really means pd msdos graphics if you are not physically on milnet you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel there are several internet sites that maintain copies mirrors of the simtel archives most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead a popular usa mirror site is oak oakland edu which keeps simtel files in eg pub msdos graphics if you have no ftp capability you can retrieve files from simtel by e mail see informational postings in comp archives msdos announce to find out how if you are outside the usa consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel mirror is microsoft windows there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware due to windows system overhead note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window the newest entry is winecj which is free and extremely fast version is available from ftp rahul net file pub bryanw pc jpeg wecj zip requires windows and or more colors mode this is a no frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers but it s so fast you ll use it anyway at least for previewing jview is freeware fairly fast has good on line help and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format but it can t create new jpeg files and it doesn t view gifs jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but it s an excellent basic viewer the current version is available from ftp cica indiana edu file pub pc win desktop jview zip mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites including wuarchive wustl edu winjpeg shareware displays jpeg gif targa tiff and bmp image files it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter it has some other nifty features including color balance adjustment and slideshow the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note above file msdos windows winjp zip this is a slow compatible version if you register you ll get the only version which is roughly faster colorview is another shareware entry this was an early and promising contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg if you want to try it anyway the current version is available from ftp cica indiana edu file pub pc win desktop cview zip i understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with colorview for dos dvpeg see dos heading also works under windows but only in full screen mode not in a window os the following files are available from hobbes nmsu edu note check pub uploads for more recent versions the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories pub os x graphics jpegv zip bit version of free ijg conversion programs version pub os all graphics

very fast jpeg viewing fast if you have huge amounts of ram otherwise about the same speed as the above programs strong bit display support shareware macintosh most mac jpeg programs rely on apple s jpeg implementation which is part of the quicktime system extension so you need to have quicktime installed to use quicktime you need a or better cpu and you need to be running system or later if you re running system you must also install the bit quickdraw extension this is built in on system you can get quicktime by ftp from ftp apple com file dts mac quicktime quicktime hqx as of this file contains quicktime which is better than qt in several ways with respect to jpeg it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file however some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt mac users should keep in mind that quicktime s jpeg format pict jpeg is not the same as the usenet standard jfif jpeg format see section for details if you post images on usenet make sure they are in jfif format most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format the first choice is probably jpegview a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format pict jpeg format or gif format it also can convert between the two jpeg formats the current version is a big improvement over prior versions get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app jpeg view hqx requires system and quicktime on bit displays jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers in fact it s the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over x pixels on a typical mb mac given a large image jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers you can zoom in on any desired portion though some people like this behavior some don t overall jpegview s user interface is very well thought out gifconverter a shareware image viewer converter supports jfif and pict jpeg as well as gif and several other image formats the latest version is get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac art gif gif converter hqx requires system or later gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeg gif viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images also the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images without quicktime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime but it s faster with quicktime note if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert then viewing the gif version jpeg convert a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities is available from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app jpeg convert hqx this will run on any mac but it only does file conversion not viewing you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v a jpeg gif converter based on an old version of the ijg code if you are using this program you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert apple s free program pictpixie can view images in jfif quicktime jpeg and gif format and can convert between these formats you can get pictpixie from ftp apple com file dts mac quicktime qt stuff pictpixie hqx requires quicktime pictpixie was intended as a developer s tool and it s really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface worse pictpixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix there is an old version of pictpixie called pictcompressor floating around the net if you have this you should trash it as it s even buggier also the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleaned up descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net storm technology s picture decompress is a free jpeg viewer converter this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without system or quicktime so you may be forced to use it on older systems it does need bit quickdraw so really old machines can t use it you can get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app picture decompress hqx you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to jpeg to allow picture decompress to open it if your machine is too old to run bit quickdraw a mac plus for instance gifconverter is your only choice for single program jpeg viewing if you don t want to pay for gifconverter use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg although not all can deal with the usenet standard jfif format adobe photoshop version or later can read and write jfif format jpeg files use the jpeg plug in from the acquire menu you must set the file type of a downloaded jpeg file to jpeg to allow photoshop to recognize it amiga most programs listed in this section are stored in the aminet archive at amiga physik unizh ch there are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one in the usa a good choice is wuarchive wustl edu look under mirrors amiga physik unizh ch hamlab plus is an excellent jpeg viewer converter as well as being a general image manipulation tool it s cheap shareware and can read several formats besides jpeg the current version is a demo version is available from amiga physik unizh ch and mirror sites file amiga gfx edit hamlab d lha the demo version will crop images larger than x but it is otherwise

targa formats the amiga world is heavily infested with quick and dirty jpeg programs many based on an ancient beta test version of the free ijg jpeg software thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk of the month without so much as notifying the authors among these are augjpeg newamyjpeg vjpeg and probably others i have not even heard of in my opinion anything older than

images to jpeg although this must be done from the cli rather than by double clicking recent versions since of the shareware program translator can handle jpeg along with about other image formats while older versions can be found on some archimedes bboards the current version is only available by registering with the author john kortink nutterbrink wj enschede the netherlands price dutch guilders about or pounds there s also a commercial product called jpeg which provides jpeg read write functionality and direct jpeg viewing as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options this is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs contact dt software freepost cambridge uk tel portable software for almost any system if none of the above fits your situation you can obtain and compile the free jpeg conversion software described in b you ll also need a viewer program if your display is bits or less any gif viewer will do fine if you have a display with more color capability try to find a viewer that can read targa or ppm bit image files there are numerous commercial jpeg offerings with more popping up every day i recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow in that case purchase a hardware assisted product ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final jpeg standard and about whether it can handle the jfif file format many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else s

this hoopla about color quantization most people don t have full color bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware stores or fewer bits per pixel so it can display or fewer distinct colors at a time to display a full color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors this process is called color quantization this is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term we re stuck with the standard usage though clearly color quantization is a lossy process it turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings since jpeg is a full color format converting a color jpeg image for display on bit or less hardware requires color quantization this is true for all color jpegs even if you feed a or less color gif into jpeg what comes out of the decompressor is not colors but thousands of colors this happens because jpeg s lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray scale output incidentally because of this effect it s nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences i occasionally see posted images described as color jpeg this tells me that the poster a hasn t read this faq and b probably converted the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classified as color or gray scale just like photographs but number of colors just isn t a useful concept for jpeg on the other hand a gif image by definition has already been quantized to or fewer colors a gif does have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesn t allow more than palette entries for purposes of usenet picture distribution gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients don t have to this is also the disadvantage of gif you re stuck with the sender s quantization if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to re quantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full color image furthermore if the sender didn t use a high quality color quantization algorithm you re out of luck for this reason jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don t match the sender s display hardware jpeg s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user s display hardware furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of jpeg images you already have with a gif you re stuck forevermore with what was sent it s also worth mentioning that many gif viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines if you view a color gif on a color ega display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the gif one to display it but often it s also due to sloppiness jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed thus jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for low color resolution displays as well as high resolution ones finally an ever growing number of people have better than bit display hardware already bit hi color pc displays true bit displays on workstations and macintoshes etc for these people gif is already obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively thus jpeg is an all around better choice than gif for representing images in a machine independent fashion how does jpeg work the buzz words to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding this article s long enough already so i m not going to say more than that here for technical information see the comp compression faq this is available from the news answers archive at rtfm mit edu in files pub usenet news answers compression faq part if you need help in using the news answers archive see the top of this article what about lossless jpeg there s a great deal of confusion on this subject the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm i e one that guarantees the final output is bit for bit identical to the original input however this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offers much less compression at present very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist and all of them are commercial saying q to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step with the v free jpeg code you can also say sample x to turn off subsampling keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value it s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image at this minimum loss setting regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed bit per pixel image true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bit for bit accuracy if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with or more bits per pixel furthermore jpeg is public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents why all the argument about file formats strictly speaking jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations since we can t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem in the absence of official standards a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs aren t compatible with anybody else s the closest thing we have to a de facto standard jpeg format is some work that s been coordinated by people at c cube microsystems they have defined two jpeg based file formats jfif jpeg file interchange format a low end format that transports pixels and not much else tiff jpeg aka tiff an extension of the aldus tiff format tiff is a high end format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides tiff is a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of tiff it s not likely that adding jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpeg related products it s reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the tiff spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details even when tiff jpeg is well defined the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator tiff jpeg files may never be as transportable a particular case that people may be interested in is apple s quicktime software for the macintosh quicktime uses a jfif compatible format wrapped inside the mac specific pict structure conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward and several mac programs are available to do it see mac portion of section a if you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section for details another particular case is handmade software s programs gif jpg jpg gif and image alchemy these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi this format is not readable by any non hsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings use the j switch to get jfif output this applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif format by default you still should be careful not to post hsi format files unless you want to get flamed by people on non pc platforms how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software won t read it s likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg based format you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file a jfif standard file will start with the characters hex ff d ff e followed by two variable bytes often hex followed by jfif if you see ff d at the start but not the rest of it you may have a raw jpeg file this is probably decodable as is by jfif software it s worth a try anyway hsi files start with hsi you re out of luck unless you have hsi software portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they won t decompress properly with non hsi programs a macintosh pict file if jpeg compressed will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a jfif header scan for jfif strip off everything before the ff d and you should be able to read it anything else it s a proprietary format or not jpeg at all if you are lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d try stripping off everything before that in uuencoded usenet postings the characteristic jfif pattern is begin line m c x whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with begin line m i if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non jfif files what about arithmetic coding the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed the choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file on typical images arithmetic coding produces a file or percent smaller than huffman coding all the file size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm at t and mitsubishi thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies the fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best at least in the short run i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding the space savings isn t great enough to justify the potential legal hassles in particular arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future stay tuned for further details does loss accumulate with repeated compression decompression it would be nice if having compressed an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially unfortunately this is not the case in general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss i e you get an identical jpeg file even this is not true at least not with the current free jpeg software it s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first generation output it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change one of the things on our to do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but i am not optimistic about it in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full color output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff error degradation if you re wondering why it s because the pixel block boundaries move if you cropped off only multiples of pixels you might be safe but that s a mighty limited capability the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you don t want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while working on the image then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compression decompression time this way what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg as stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg if you can obtain the original full color data the gif was made from it s far better to make a jpeg from that but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you a chance to re do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary some gifs may be better left as gifs as explained in section in particular cartoon type gifs with sixteen or fewer colors don t convert well you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif so check the sizes too experience to date suggests that large high visual quality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to jpeg with least degradation don t waste your time converting any gif much under kbytes also don t expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from full color originals to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight through jpeg files would be i e shoot for or rd the size of the gif file not th as suggested in earlier comparisons many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant color border around a gif image while useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files it is not free in jpeg files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging if you are on an x windows system xv s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this cjpeg s default q setting of is appropriate for full color input but for gif inputs q settings of to often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation if you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher q setting may not be necessary color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the colors that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value the trouble with dithering is that to jpeg it looks like high spatial frequency color noise and jpeg can t compress noise very well the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you had it to get around this you want to smooth the gif image before compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a better looking output image than you d get without smoothing with the v free jpeg software or products based on it a simple smoothing capability is built in try smooth or so when converting gifs values of to seem to work well for high quality gifs heavy handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors if you can see regular fine scale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you don t want if you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package however cjpeg s built in smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality smooth is probably a good starting point for converting gifs but if you really care about the image you ll want to check the results and maybe

re gamma correction in article t meinnrc gap caltech edu madler cco caltech edu mark adler writes can someone who knows what they re talking about add a faq entry on gamma correction thanks i get regular questions about gamma correction since i go to great pains to deal with it properly in xli the image loader program i maintain here is an explanation i often use to answer these questions this might be suitable for inclusion in the faq graeme gill a note on gamma correction and images author graeme w gill graeme labtam oz au date what is all this gamma stuff anyway although it would be nice to think that an image is an image there are a lot of complications not only are there a whole bunch of different image formats gif jpeg tiff etc etc there is a whole lot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit complicated gamma is one of those things if you ve ever downloaded images from bbs or the net you ve probably noticed with most image viewing programs that some images look ok some look too dark and some look too light why is this you may ask this is gamma correction or the lack of it why do we need gamma correction at all gamma correction is needed because of the nature of crts cathode ray tubes the monitors usually used for viewing images if you have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer image by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of the scene then you have created a linear or un gamma corrected image this is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate the image as if the values in the image file were light ie adding and multiplying will work just like real light in the real world now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage and feed it into a crt you find that the crt doesn t give you an amount of light proportional to the voltage the amount of light coming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage something like this light out voltage crt gamma so if you just dump your nice linear image out to a crt the image will look much too dark to fix this up you have to gamma correct the image first you need to do the opposite of what the crt will do to the image so that things cancel out and you get what you want so you have to do this to your image gamma corrected image image crt gamma for most crts the crt gamma is somewhere between and if that is all it is why does it seem so complicated the problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction also not all sources of images give you linear images video cameras or video signals in general because of this a lot of images already have some gamma correction done to them and you are rarely sure how much if you try and display one of those images with a program that does gamma correction for you the image gets corrected twice and looks way to light if you display one of those images with a program that doesn t do gamma correction then it will look vaguely right but not perfect because the gamma correction is not exactly right for you particular crt whose fault is all this it is really three things one is all those display programs out there that don t do gamma correction properly another is that most image formats don t specify a standard gamma or don t have some way or recording what their gamma correction is the third thing is that not many people understand what gamma correction is all about and create a lot of images with varying gamma s at least two file formats do the right thing the utah graphics toolkit rle format has a semi standard way of recording the gamma of an image the jfif file standard that uses jpeg compression specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of ie a linear image but not everyone obeys the rules some image loaders for instance xli an x image utility allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you are using but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to view other image viewers eg xv another x image program and utilities eg the pbm toolkit provide ways of changing the gamma of an image but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction yourself allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has and then the gamma correction you need to suite your crt monitor note that xv doesn t provide an easy way of modifying the gamma of an image you need to adjust the r g and b curves to the appropriate gamma in the coledit controls altering the intensity in the hsv controls doesn t do the right thing as it fails to take account of the effect gamma has on h and s this tends to give a tint to the image how can i figure out what my viewer does or what gamma my screen has the simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma jpg provided with xli distribution which is a jfif jpeg format file containing two grayscale ramps the ramps are chosen to look linear to the human eye one using continuous tones and the other using dithering if your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects images then the two ramps should look symmetrical and the point at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half way from the top to the bottom to find this point it helps if you move away a little from the screen and de focus your eyes a bit if your viewer doesn t do gamma correction then left hand ramp will have a long dark part and a short white part and the point of equal brightness will be above the center if your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction for a display then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the gamma and decrease it if it is below the center the value will usually be around with xli for instance you can adjust the display gamma with the dispgamma flag and once you ve got it right you can set the display gamma environment variable in your profile how do i figure out what the gamma of an image is this is the most tricky bit as a general rule it seems that a lot of true color ie bit ppm jpg images have a gamma of linear although there are many about that have some gamma correction it seems that the majority of pseudo color images ie bit images with color maps gif etc are gamma corrected to some degree or other if your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will look good and gamma corrected images will look too light if your viewer doesn t do gamma correction then linear images will look too dark and gamma corrected images will ok why linear images are sometimes not such a good thing one of the reason that many high quality formats such as video use gamma correction is that it actually makes better use of the storage medium this is because the human eye has a logarithmic response to light and gamma correction has a similar compression characteristic this means images could make better use of bits per color for instance if they used gamma correction the implication though is that every time you want to do any image processing you should convert the bit image to or so linear bits to retain the same accuracy since little popular software does this and none of the popular image formats can agree on a standard gamma correction factor it is difficult to justify gamma corrected images at the popular level if some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma and if image manipulation software takes care to use extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing i am told that the kodak photocd format for instance has a standard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the highest quality out of the bits used to hold the image

correct e mail address to reply to what is jpeg jpeg pronounced jay peg is a standardized image compression mechanism jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard jpeg is designed for compressing either full color or gray scale digital images of natural real world scenes it does not work so well on non realistic images such as cartoons or line drawings jpeg does not handle black and white bit per pixel images nor does it handle motion picture compression standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named jbig and mpeg respectively jpeg is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn t quite identical to what you originally put in the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details aren t perceived as well as small details of light and dark thus jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans if you plan to machine analyze your images the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality you can make extremely small files if you don t mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc conversely if you aren t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression why use jpeg there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store bit per pixel color data instead of bit per pixel data making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images being able to compress a mbyte full color file down to kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time if you are comparing gif and jpeg the size ratio is more like four to one more details below if your viewing software doesn t support jpeg directly you ll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images even with a jpeg capable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance thus using jpeg is essentially a time space tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply it s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file i ll let you do the arithmetic yourself the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information bits pixel million colors instead of or less or fewer colors if you have only bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you within a couple of years though bit gif will look as obsolete as black and white macpaint format does today furthermore for reasons detailed in section jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images gif is superior in image quality file size or both one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to as a rule of thumb jpeg is superior to gif for storing full color or gray scale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material jpeg is superior even if you don t have bit display hardware and it is a lot superior if you do see section for details gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings in particular large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif jpeg can t squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects this sort of image is best kept in gif form in particular single color borders are quite cheap in gif files but they should be avoided in jpeg files jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pure black pixels adjacent to a row of pure white pixels for example sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in gif files borders overlaid text etc the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that s only a few pixels high if you have a gif with a lot of small size overlaid text don t jpeg it computer drawn images ray traced scenes for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity the more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same goes for semi realistic artwork fantasy drawings and such plain black and white two level images should never be converted to jpeg you need at least about gray levels before jpeg is useful for gray scale images it should also be noted that gif is lossless for gray scale images of up to levels while jpeg is not if you have an existing library of gif images you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg you will lose a little image quality if you do section which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif only applies if both formats start from a full color original if you start from a gif you ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg can only make things worse however the disk space savings may justify converting anyway this is a decision you ll have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section for hints be prepared to leave some images in gif format since some gifs will not convert well how well does jpeg compress images pretty darn well here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy a x full color image of a ship in a harbor the first three files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section b file size in bytes comments ship ppm original file in ppm format no compression bits or bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead ship ppm z ppm file passed through unix compress compress doesn t accomplish a lot you ll note other text oriented compressors give similar results ship gif converted to gif with ppmquant fs ppmtogif most of the savings is the result of losing color info gif saves bits pixel not see sec ship jpg cjpeg q highest useful quality setting this is indistinguishable from the bit original at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs ship jpg cjpeg q default setting you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original even with both on screen at once ship jpg cjpeg q this has slight defects if you know what to look for you could tell it s been jpeged without seeing the original still as good image quality as many recent postings in usenet pictures groups ship jpg cjpeg q jpeg s characteristic blockiness becomes apparent at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some still i ve seen plenty of usenet postings that were of poorer image quality than this ship jpg o cjpeg q optimize optimize cuts table overhead blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or indexing purposes note that this file is tiny the compression ratio from the original is in this case jpeg can make a file that s a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality the q file is every bit as good as the gif better if you have a full color display this seems to be a typical ratio for real world scenes what are good quality settings for jpeg most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings quality does not mean keep of the information as some have claimed the quality scale is purely arbitrary it s not a percentage of anything the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb the default quality setting q is very often the best choice this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image try q first if you see defects then go up except for experimental purposes never go above q saying q will produce a file two or three times as large as q but of hardly any better quality if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to q without objectionable degradation on the other hand you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg the default q is about right for compressing bit images but q to is usually better for converting gifs see section for more info if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are prepared to tolerate large defects a q setting in the range of to is about right q or so may be amusing as op art note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section b and to many programs based on it other jpeg implementations such as image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale some programs don t even provide a numeric scale just high medium low style choices where can i get jpeg software most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp if you don t know how to use ftp see the faq article how to find sources if you don t have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail servers in the same article that article appears regularly in news answers or you can get it by sending e mail to mail server rtfm mit edu with send usenet news answers finding sources in the body the anonymous ftp list faq may also be helpful it s usenet news answers ftp list faq in the news answers archive note this list changes constantly if you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest jpeg faq from the news answers archive a if you are looking for canned software viewers etc the first part of this list is system specific programs that only run on one kind of system if you don t see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet but some commercial programs are listed too x windows xv shareware is an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and many other image formats it can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations it s available for ftp from export lcs mit edu file contrib xv tar z version is a major upgrade with support for bit displays and many other improvements however it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking if you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge stick with version also available from export note that version is not a good choice if you have a bit display you ll get only bit color nor for converting bit images to jpeg but works fine for converting gif and other bit images to jpeg caution there is a glitch in version be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a jpeg file or the file will be blurry another good choice for x windows is john cristy s free imagemagick package also available from export lcs mit edu file contrib imagemagick tar z this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks the imagemagick viewer handles bit displays correctly for colormapped displays it does better though slower color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software both of the above are large complex packages if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release xloadimage is free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xloadimage tar z xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg files because it has the ijg v decoder while xloadimage is using a hacked over v the next xloadimage release will fix this xli is also free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xli tar z both programs are said to do the right thing with bit displays ms dos this covers plain dos for windows or os programs see the next headings one good choice is eric praetzel s free dvpeg which views jpeg and gif files the current version is available by ftp from sunee uwaterloo ca file pub jpeg viewers dvpeg zip this is a good basic viewer that works on either or machines the user interface is not flashy but it s functional another freeware jpeg gif tga viewer is mohammad rezaei s hiview the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics hv zip hiview requires a or better cpu and a vcpi compatible memory manager qemm and max work windows and os do not hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen for larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen rather than using panning scrolling as most viewers do you may or may not prefer this approach but there s no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably note installation is a bit tricky read the directions carefully a shareware alternative is colorview for dos this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives its user interface is also much spiffier looking although personally i find it harder to use more keystrokes inconsistent behavior it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview at least on my hardware for images larger than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than hiview the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics dcview zip requires a vesa graphics driver if you don t have one look in vesadrv zip or vesa tsr zip from the same directory many recent pcs have a built in vesa driver so don t try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing a second shareware alternative is fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but i don t know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel archives at that time the well known gif viewer compushow cshow supports jpeg in its latest revision a however cshow s jpeg implementation isn t very good it s slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is poor except on hi color displays too bad it d have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow shareware available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos gif cshw a zip due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine if you can t get any of them to work you ll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif then view with your favorite gif viewer if you have hi color hardware don t use gif as the intermediate format try to find a targa capable viewer instead vpic is reputed to do the right thing with hi color displays the independent jpeg group s free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics jpeg zip or jpeg zip if you have a and extended memory these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section b they will convert jpeg to and from gif targa and ppm formats handmade software offers free jpeg gif conversion tools gif jpg jpg gif these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format in particular you can t get bit color output from a jpeg the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsi s proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenet standard jfif format since hsi format files are rather widespread on bbses this is a useful capability version of these tools is free prior versions were shareware get it from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics gif jpg zip note do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet since it is not readable on non pc platforms handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package image alchemy this will translate jpeg files both jfif and hsi formats to and from many other image formats it can also display images a demo version of image alchemy version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics alch zip note about simtel the internet s key archive site for pc related programs is simtel full name wsmr simtel army mil simtel runs a non unix system with weird directory names where this document refers to directory eg msdos graphics at simtel that really means pd msdos graphics if you are not physically on milnet you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel there are several internet sites that maintain copies mirrors of the simtel archives most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead a popular usa mirror site is oak oakland edu which keeps simtel files in eg pub msdos graphics if you have no ftp capability

windows system overhead note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window the newest entry is winecj which is free and extremely fast version is available from ftp rahul net file pub bryanw pc jpeg wecj zip requires windows and or more colors mode this is a no frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers but it s so fast you ll use it anyway at least for previewing jview is freeware fairly fast has good on line help and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format but it can t create new jpeg files and it doesn t view gifs jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but it s an excellent basic viewer the current version is available from ftp cica indiana edu file pub pc win desktop jview zip mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites including wuarchive wustl edu winjpeg shareware displays jpeg gif targa tiff and bmp image files it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter it has some other nifty features

jpeg format see section for details if you post images on usenet make sure they are in jfif format most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format the first choice is probably jpegview a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format pict jpeg format or gif format it also can convert between the two jpeg formats the current version is a big improvement over prior versions get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app jpeg view hqx requires system and quicktime on bit displays jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers in fact it s the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over x pixels on a typical mb mac given a large image jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers you can zoom in on any desired portion though some people like this behavior some don t overall jpegview s user interface is very well thought out gifconverter a shareware image viewer converter supports jfif and pict jpeg as well as gif and several other image formats the latest version is get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac art gif gif converter hqx requires system or later gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeg gif viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images also the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images without quicktime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime but it s faster with quicktime note if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert then viewing the gif version jpeg convert a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities is available from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app jpeg convert hqx this will run on any mac but it only does file conversion not viewing you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v a jpeg gif converter based on an old version of the ijg code if you are using this program you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert apple s free program pictpixie can view images in jfif quicktime jpeg and gif format and can convert between these formats you can get pictpixie from ftp apple com file dts mac quicktime qt stuff pictpixie hqx requires quicktime pictpixie was intended as a developer s tool and it s really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface worse pictpixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix there is an old version of pictpixie called pictcompressor floating around the net if you have this you should trash it as it s even buggier also the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleaned up descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net storm technology s picture decompress is a free jpeg viewer converter this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without system or quicktime so you may be forced to use it on older systems it does need bit quickdraw so really old machines can t use it you can get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app picture decompress hqx you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to jpeg to allow picture decompress to open it if your machine is too old to run bit quickdraw a mac plus for instance gifconverter is your only choice for single program jpeg viewing if you don t want to pay for gifconverter use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg although not all can deal with the usenet standard jfif format adobe photoshop version or later can read and write jfif format jpeg files use the jpeg plug in from the acquire menu you must set the file type of a downloaded jpeg file to jpeg to allow photoshop to recognize it amiga most programs listed in this section are stored in the aminet archive at amiga physik unizh ch there are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the

can handle jpeg along with about other image formats while older versions can be found on some archimedes bboards the current version is only available by registering with the author john kortink nutterbrink wj enschede the netherlands price dutch guilders about or pounds there s also a commercial product called jpeg which provides jpeg read write functionality and direct jpeg viewing as well

imageviewer is a pd utility that displays images and can do some format conversions the current version reads jpeg but does not write it imageviewer is available from the standard next archives at sonata cc purdue edu and cs orst edu somewhere in pub next both are currently being re organized so it s hard to point to specific sub directories note that there is an older version floating around that does not support jpeg portable software for almost any system if none of the above fits your situation you can obtain and compile the free jpeg conversion software described in b you ll also need a viewer program if your display is bits or less any gif viewer will do fine if you have a display with more color capability try to find a viewer that can read targa or ppm bit image files there are numerous commercial jpeg offerings with more popping up every day i recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow in that case purchase a hardware assisted product ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final jpeg standard and about whether it can handle the jfif file format many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else s files b if you are looking for source code to work with free portable c code for jpeg compression is available from

for details we hope to make this software industrial quality although as with anything that s free we offer no warranty and accept no liability the independent jpeg group is a volunteer organization if you d like to contribute to improving our software you are welcome to join what s all this hoopla about color quantization most people don t have full color bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware stores or fewer bits per pixel so it can display or fewer distinct colors at a time to display a full color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors this process is called color quantization this is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term we re stuck with the standard usage though clearly color quantization is a lossy process it turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings since jpeg is a full color format converting a color jpeg image for display on bit or less hardware requires color quantization this is true for all color jpegs even if you feed a or less color gif into jpeg what comes out of the decompressor is not colors but thousands of colors this happens because jpeg s lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray scale output incidentally because of this effect it s nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences i occasionally see posted images described as color jpeg this tells me that the poster a hasn t read this faq and b probably converted the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classified as color or gray scale just like photographs but number of colors just isn t a useful concept for jpeg on the other hand a gif image by definition has already been quantized to or fewer colors a gif does have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesn t allow more than palette entries for purposes of usenet picture distribution gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients don t have to this is also the disadvantage of gif you re stuck with the sender s quantization if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to re quantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full color image furthermore if the sender didn t use a high quality color quantization algorithm you re out of luck for this reason jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don t match the sender s display hardware jpeg s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user s display hardware furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of jpeg images you already have with a gif you re stuck forevermore with what was sent it s also worth mentioning that many gif viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines if you view a color gif on a color ega display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the gif one to display it but often it s also due to sloppiness jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed thus jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for low color resolution displays as well as high resolution ones finally an ever growing number of people have better than bit display hardware already bit hi color pc displays true bit displays on workstations and macintoshes etc for these people gif is already obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively thus jpeg is an all around better choice than gif for representing images in a machine independent fashion how does jpeg work the buzz words to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding this article s long enough already so i m not going to say more than that here for technical information see the comp compression faq this is available from the news answers archive at rtfm mit edu in files pub usenet news answers compression faq part if you need help in using the news answers archive see the top of this article what about lossless jpeg there s a great deal of confusion on this subject the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm i e one that guarantees the final output is bit for bit identical to the original input however this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offers much less compression at present very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist and all of them are commercial saying q to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step with the v free jpeg code you can also say sample x to turn off subsampling keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value it s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image at this minimum loss setting regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed bit per pixel image true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bit for bit accuracy if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with or more bits per pixel furthermore jpeg is public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents why all the argument about file formats strictly speaking jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations since we can t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem in the absence of official standards a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs aren t compatible with anybody else s the closest thing we have to a de facto standard jpeg format is some work that s been coordinated by people at c cube microsystems they have defined two jpeg based file formats jfif jpeg file interchange format a low end format that transports pixels and not much else tiff jpeg aka tiff an extension of the aldus tiff format tiff is a high end format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides tiff is a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of tiff it s not likely that adding jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpeg related products it s reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the tiff spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details even when tiff jpeg is well defined the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator tiff jpeg files may never be as transportable a particular case that people may be interested in is apple s quicktime software for the macintosh quicktime uses a jfif compatible format wrapped inside the mac specific pict structure conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward and several mac programs are available to do it see mac portion of section a if you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section for details another particular case is handmade software s programs gif jpg jpg gif and image alchemy these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi this format is not readable by any non hsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings use the j switch to get jfif output this applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif format by default you still should be careful not to post hsi format files unless you want to get flamed by people on non pc platforms how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software won t read it s likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg based format you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file a jfif standard file will start with the characters hex ff d ff e followed by two variable bytes often hex followed by jfif if you see ff d at the start but not the rest of it you may have a raw jpeg file this is probably decodable as is by jfif software it s worth a try anyway hsi files start with hsi you re out of luck unless you have hsi software portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they won t decompress properly with non hsi programs a macintosh pict file if jpeg compressed will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a jfif header scan for jfif strip off everything before the ff d and you should be able to read it anything else it s a proprietary format or not jpeg at all if you are lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d try stripping off everything before that in uuencoded usenet postings the characteristic jfif pattern is begin line m c x whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with begin line m i if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non jfif files what about arithmetic coding the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed the choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file on typical images arithmetic coding produces a file or percent smaller than huffman coding all the file size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm at t and mitsubishi thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies the fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best at least in the short run i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding the space savings isn t great enough to justify the potential legal hassles in particular arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future stay tuned for further details does loss accumulate with repeated compression decompression it would be nice if having compressed an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially unfortunately this is not the case in general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss i e you get an identical jpeg file even this is not true at least not with the current free jpeg software it s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first generation output it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change one of the things on our to do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but i am not optimistic about it in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full color output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff error degradation if you re wondering why it s because the pixel block boundaries move if you cropped off only multiples of pixels you might be safe but that s a mighty limited capability the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you don t want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while working on the image then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compression decompression time this way what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg as stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg if you can obtain the original full color data the gif was made from it s far better to make a jpeg from that but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you a chance to re do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary some gifs may be better left as gifs as explained in section in particular cartoon type gifs with sixteen or fewer colors don t convert well you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif so check the sizes too experience to date suggests that large high visual quality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to jpeg with least degradation don t waste your time converting any gif much under kbytes also don t expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from full color originals to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight through jpeg files would be i e shoot for or rd the size of the gif file not th as suggested in earlier comparisons many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant color border around a gif image while useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files it is not free in jpeg files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging if you are on an x windows system xv s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this cjpeg s default q setting of is appropriate for full color input but for gif inputs q settings of to often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation if you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher q setting may not be necessary color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the colors that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value the trouble with dithering is that to jpeg it looks like high spatial frequency color noise and jpeg can t compress noise very well the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you had it to get around this you want to smooth the gif image before compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a better looking output image than you d get without smoothing with the v free jpeg software or products based on it a simple smoothing capability is built in try smooth or so when converting gifs values of to seem to work well for high quality gifs heavy handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors if you can see regular fine scale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you don t want if you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package however cjpeg s built in smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality smooth is probably a good starting point for converting gifs but if you really care about the image you ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings for more information about jpeg in general or the free

re optimizing projections in article sua tinnqs no names nerdc ufl edu lioness ufcc ufl edu writes my three d library does a lot of projections duh but currently it is projecting an object s vertices on a per triangle basis this is grossly inefficient for of the objects displayed which can be optimized by doing projections one time once for each vertex but objects whose z extents intersect the hither plane can t benefit from this because new vertices must be created during z clipping anyone have any better ideas yes here s what you should do keep the vertices in an array and have the polygons triangles are okay but n sided polygons are slightly more efficient store the indices into the array of the vertices that comprise them you set a flag for each vertex when you transform it so you don t have to transform any vertex more than once you also do backface elimination before processing the polygon so that vertices that belong only to bacfacing polys don t have to be transformed at all whenever you transform a vertex check if it s on the far side of the hither plane if it is you can project it right away and store the result then do your z clip any vertices that get produced will have to have their projection done at that stage bernie roehl university of waterloo dept of electrical and computer engineering mail broehl sunee uwaterloo ca voice x work

re where did the hacker ethic go vinci filipe vxcrna cern ch wrote in article may hal com bobp hal com bob pendleton writes from article may pony ingres com by mwmeyer ingres com mike wading through the muck and meyer in article may hal com bobp hal com bob pendleton writes this is getting pretty silly first off hacker is an obsolete term doesn t matter what it used to mean today it means thief it only means thief if you want it to mean that to me it means lots of context wickedly omitted by myself anyway if i say joe is a hacker to most english speaking people who know the word they ll probably think he is either a poor golfer or a bad carpenter but there are very very few people who will think he is a good and clever programmer if you chose to call yourself by a term that means thief don t be surprised when people think you are a thief even if you don t agree with that definition of the word the narrower view that a hacker when associated with the computing environment is a dishonest expert is not so widespread i m my opinion at least with the people involved with the field imho the wider meaning is not obsolete at all no matter how much the lay press would like it to be therefore i conclude that if you call yourself a hacker and somebody perceives you as a thief then this person belongs to a very very small group that has some computer knowledge but not enough to know the wider and original meaning of the word unfortunately the general public has a very narrow view of the deep dark recesses of the art of computing what little they do see is from the view given to them by the media from what i have seen from the media hacker is not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person i on the other hand know what hacker means from those who consider themselves such following is the definition from jargon file this is also known as the hackers dictionary the definitions are arranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage hacker originally someone who makes furniture with an axe n a person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities as opposed to most users who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary one who programs enthusiastically even obsessively or who enjoys programming rather than just theorizing about programming a person capable of appreciating hack value a person who is good at programming quickly an expert at a particular program or one who frequently does work using it or on it as in a unix hacker definitions through are correlated and people who fit them congregate an expert or enthusiast of any kind one might be an astronomy hacker for example one who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations deprecated a malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information by poking around hence password hacker network hacker see cracker the term hacker also tends to connote membership in the global community defined by the net see network the and internet address it also implies that the person described is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic see hacker ethic the it is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe oneself that way hackers consider themselves something of an elite a meritocracy based on ability though one to which new members are gladly welcome there is thus a certain ego satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker but if you claim to be one and are not you ll quickly be labeled bogus see also wannabee hacker ethic the n the belief that information sharing is a powerful positive good and that it is an ethical duty of hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and facilitating access to information and to computing resources wherever possible the belief that system cracking for fun and exploration is ethically ok as long as the cracker commits no theft vandalism or breach of confidentiality both of these normative ethical principles are widely but by no means universally accepted among hackers most hackers subscribe to the hacker ethic in sense and many act on it by writing and giving away free software a few go further and assert that all information should be free and any proprietary control of it is bad this is the philosophy behind the gnu project sense is more controversial some people consider the act of cracking itself to be unethical like breaking and entering but this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who see themselves as benign crackers see also samurai on this view it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy to a break into a system and then b explain to the sysop preferably by email from a superuser account exactly how it was done and how the hole can be plugged acting as an unpaid an unsolicited tiger team the most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share technical tricks software and where possible computing resources with other hackers huge cooperative networks such as usenet fidonet and internet see internet address can function without central control because of this trait they both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be hackerdom s most valuable intangible asset finally a true hacker does not name himself herself one for this is a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large to me a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who says nahh i just know a thing or two people always exagerate note that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing limself meaning himself herself one but simply says that it is better not to do so there are many who do not know the meaning of hacker so in order to defend the true meaning of the word it is sometimes necessary to borrow on the reputation of a known respected hacker around the workplace this means that hacker is defined in terms of some well known and respected person sometimes there may only be one such person no matter what mr dumpty says language doesn t work that way actually it does you just have to get adequate press coverage language works anyway that we want it to work the purpose of language is to communicate to oversimplify as long as communication is taking place then language is

setting up a slip client under dos and windows long i have been posting monthly how to setup a slip client on a pc posts for a few months lots of work and imminent graduation have come in the way of posting one of these for march or earlier this month for which i apologize this file includes information on writing a script for university of minnesota phone and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with phone for additions modifications and corrections i can be reached at ashok biochemistry cwru edu best wishes ashok begin slip txt based on my experiences on setting up slip under dos and windows here are my comments on setting up slip in this environment i thank the trumpet beta testers and the cwru slip beta testers for their comments configuring your modem a turn off dtr at d w i have to disable dtr because the communication program that i use to dial my slip server qmodem drops dtr when i exit the program and therefore hangs up the line if you use a program like kermit or conex to establish the slip connection then this need not be done these programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit note if you use univ of minn phone to dial and establish a slip connection you do not need to turn off dtr b dial and establish the slip connection first this can be done automatically if you use a program like phone from the university of minnesota which will dial and establish a slip connection then load the slip packet driver the phone scripting language is simple and phone scripts can be easily written to configure phone to work with other slip server in addition while the only packet driver that phone works with is umslip currently it is easy to write a batch file hack that lets phone work with other packet drivers there is a section on phone in the document with both script and batch file examples configuring the slip drivers there are five slip packet drivers commonly available cslipper exe peter tattam s compressed slip driver slipper exe peter tattam s slip driver slip com crynwr driver i like phil burn s modified driver ethersl com crynwr driver ethernet simulation over slip umslip com univ of minnesota driver based on slip of these four i vastly prefer c slipper exe over slip com or ethersl com for the following reasons a it is much faster even though my modem has just a uart b while using etherslip slip umslip myself and several others have noticed that the pc clock gets messed up after performing a long ftp transfer c it supports pktmux when used in ethernet simulation mode d when used in ethernet simulation mode c slipper seem to work with every tcp ip application that i have tested it with instructions for c slipper exe and you do not use phone a load slipper in your autoexec bat file according to instructions for instance if you have a v bis modem on com slipper com vec baud b if you use dos tcp ip applications in win dos boxes then use the double ended packet driver shim winpkt com this creates a virtual packet driver at x dos applications in native mode dos applications in windows dos boxes and windows applications can all use this virtual driver at x winpkt com x x c if you use qvt net load pktint com next qvt net is configured in qvtnet ini to use the interrupt at x pktint com instructions for slip com a try getting a version slip driver philip burns of northwestern university has a modified slip com driver that is better at hardware handshaking this driver is distributed along with nupop b load the driver after establishing the slip connection my modem is a v bis modem on com so here is how i would load the driver slip w x h slip x f c as discussed above if you use dos tcp ip applications in windows x dos boxes you probably want to use winpkt com winpkt com x x d if you use winqvt net load pktint com pktint com instructions for ethersl com if you choose to use ethersl com instead of slip com the instructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference you will have to delete the line device vcd from the enh section of system ini this will interfere with running regular windows comm applications such as crosstalk and you will get lots of dropped characters etc in these applications this is therefore not recommended etherslip would be loaded as ethersl w x h x f configuring windows a make the following modifications to the system ini file enh section i list all your com ports with their addresses and interrupts com base f com irq com base f com irq com base e com irq this can also be done from within windows control panel but double clicking on the ports icon ii give the port to which your modem is attached a generous com buffer com buffer iii change the com port autoassign value for the com port that you wish to use for your modem to zero this is the amount of time that windows waits in seconds before handing control of that com port to another application if you use winqvt net and then want to switch from one session to another and this value is at the default value of seconds you are will get a gpf and windows will crash com autoassign this can also be done from within windows control panel double click on enhanced and under device contention set the device contention for the com port your modem is on to never warn additional notes what to do if you are assigned a different ip address for each slip session i am fortunate in that our campus slip server assigns each user a permanent ip address so i do not have worry about editing qvtnet ini each time that i establish a slip connection if you are assigned a new ip address on every occasion that you dial in please try to use bootp aware software and let bootp do the configuration for you however qvtnet is not bootp aware and rarp will not work over a slip connection to get qvtnet working in a situation such as this you must do the following edit the qvtnet ini file let the net section look like this net name ip netmask or whatever is appropriate for you arptime packet vector or whatever is appropriate save the changes and then write protect this file attrib r qvtnet ini start your slip connection and remember the name and ip address that you are assigned each time you start qvt net x the general configuration dialog box will open enter the name and ip address and you were assigned for that session click on ok and you should be up and running the changes you make will not be saved as qvtnet ini is write protected a more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic slip ip address assignment is provided by victor menayang victor ccwf cc utexas edu victor uses the program bootpq to semi automate qvtnet preparation bootpq is used to inquire the assigned ip which is then saved to a file called myip another file noip is essentially a complete qvtnet ini file that lacks the ip address in the final step myip and noip are copied into a single qvtnet ini file an example of victor s batch file is provided below slipper com pktint com bootpq i ip s myip bootpq i my ip is s copy q net myip noip e com qvtnet qvtnet ini del q myip echo off echo echo ready to run winqvtnet for questions and more details about bootpq please contact victor menayang victor ccwf cc utexas edu qpc software is attempting to add bootp capability to winqvt net how do you use pktmux over slip pktmux will not work over the slip com packet driver and crashes immediately if used with ethersl com pktmux will work with c slipper exe when c slipper is used in ethernet simulation mode an example of this configuration is shown below the latest release of pktmux is c and it is important that you use this version if you want to use virtual packet drivers with applications like trumpet for windows to be released very shortly from autoexec bat lh c slipper com vec baud ether packet driver lh pktmux pktmux loaded for virtual packet drivers lh pktdrv f first virtual packet driver used for qvt net lh pktint com qvt net pktint com pktdrv pktdrv for use in native dos or wintrumpet additional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from within windows dos boxes for example my pif file to load popmail is directed to the file popmail bat this is what popmail bat reads like pktdrv loads a virtual packet driver at x cd popmail popmail cd pktdrv u unloads the packet driver at x exit causes the dos window to close i have similar batch files that load other dos tcp ip applications like pc gopher it is my experience that pktmux works fine even if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual dos sessions are loaded at the same software interrupt for example within two different dos boxes one for popmail and the other for gopher the virtual packet driver pktdrv is loaded at x in each instance how much does pktmux degrade the performance of c slipper i have a v bis v bis modem in a running windows with a reasonably fast video card ati graphics ultra under these conditions when i have three virtual packet drivers loaded and being used as follows a driver at x f qvtnet ftp client session b driver at x in one dos window cutcp tn session c driver at x in another dos window trumpet for dos i get ftp transfer rates of kb sec while transferring compressed files this rate is comparable to that which i get with slip loaded as a packet driver and where a single tcp ip session is active if cslipper is used a packet driver and a single session is active i get transfer rates of kb sec on the same files while there is about degradation in the performance of slipper for me the benefits of being able to use pktmux outweigh the performance hit c slipper and ethernet simulation mode in ethernet simulation mode c slipper ver works with all the applications that i have tested it with one or two applications that required ethernet simulation balked at c slipper but even these rare problems have been resolved with ver when slipper is used in ethernet simulation mode and used with pktmux i get some an error message in the qvtnet console window that reads ip incorrect packet type or ip bad version number this does not seem to prevent qvtnet from functioning although i cannot comment on loss of performance what can you do if your dos tcp ip application does not work with c slipper in ethernet simulation mode in the rare event that you find a package that does not work with c slipper in ethernet simulation mode first contact the author peter tattam peter psychnet psychol utas edu au and let him know chances are that he can fix it in the meanwhile you can try the following i do not know if it is kosher but it worked when i had problems with c slipper ver c slipper is loaded at x as described above under the pktmux section i load ethersl com at x run the application and then terminate ethersl com this also works within windows virtual dos boxes however a packet driver like ethersl can be used in only one virtual dos box at a time so for example here is my batch file to run grateful med a medical reference retrieval program developed at the national library of medicine ethersl w x h x f loads etherslip cd gm search cd termin x terminates etherslip exit closes the dos box and returns me to windows if you use this method be cautious about one thing don t have any active pktmux dos sessions open at the same time after closing the ethersl window you can run your pktmux dos sessions with no problem btw the example above grateful med works with no problems with c slipper ver phone script files the documentation that accompany phone provide good instructions on writing script files to get phone to dial slip servers other than the university of minnesota server for example here is a script that i use to dial a cisco server at the university that i attend background to start a slip connection i dial our terminal server and login with a username and password after doing so i start a slip session with the following command slip username slip dialin cwru

packet drivers other than umslip with phone the quick answer there is no clean way below is a batch file hack that i wrote to use phone with other packet drivers in this example the packet driver is

true type font problem repost please help word c doesn t show the period centred character to indicate spaces if i use the ttfonts from coreldraw our editors need to be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character displayed is a large hollow box they overlap each other and characters on each side which is useless i believe the character used by w w is the period centred this character shows up with the windows charmap display as the hollow box which tends to confirm this i have edited the corel font with fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the character makes no difference to the font output in charmap or w w altering the paragraph or cedilla does alter their font graphics displayed however is the w w character used to indicate spaces the period centred character has anyone been able to get this character displayed from a coreldraw ttf russ sharp russ deakin edu au ph fax deakin university school of engineering technology geelong australia

summary canon bj vs hp deskjet hello again about a week and one half ago i posted a query looking for people feelings on the inkjet family of printers specifically a comparison between the canon bj bubblejet and the hewlett packard deskjet many people asked me to post the summary account of all the postings and e mail i received below is my original query and the responses i received i have not deleted any part of the responses only the headers and signatures so you can extract what you find necessary some people asked me for an unbiased account however the very nature of the question suggests favoritism and biased comments you must extract the information you believe unbiased and a fair representation of each printer there are a wide range of comments each has its own value there was no clear winner some like the bj especially its price performance ratio others preferred the durability and reliability of the deskjet the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid background two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention a new printer to be introduced by hewlett packard later this year around summertime and an addition to the epson product line their first inkjet you will find that after the initial purchase the costs of re filling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same this largely depends on where you purchase the re fills or replacements so shop around first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your printer no one mentioned approx how many sheets each ink cartridge will print but i suspect they are roughly equal at about sheets laser printers will do sheets per toner cartridge well that s a brief research summary of my personal research enjoy hello fellow netters i am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer i should purchase the canon bj bubblejet vs the hp deskjet i thought rather than trust the salesperson i would benefit more from relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest potential and i figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls better than any salesperson now i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the dpi of the canon bubblejet vs the hewlett packard deskjet dpi which is faster is there a noticeable print quality difference particularly in graphics which will handle large documents better pages or more any personal experience on either will be appreciated here which works better under windows any driver problems etc cost of memory font packages toner cartridges etc basically your personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable both good and bad well i bought the bj about a month ago at the start of their rebate program on that printer it ends and i bought it from computer discount warehouse because their price of couldn t be beat anywhere i looked and i think it s a hot printer just using regular copier paper produced fantastic results just in high quality mode i compared the output of a micrografx designer legal size drawing with pt type done on my bj with the same drawing printed on an hp laserjet iid and i was amazed how well i could read the small print on the bj printing speed was several seconds faster on the bj which is amazing considering that the hp has m ram installed i measured the time from when the printer first indicated it was receiving data as i used print manager in windows i showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one immediately for his office and two other engineers placed their orders too if you need cdw s phone number it s delivery to ny was two days good luck craig witkowski ceng maccvm corp mot com motorola communications electronics inc glen rock nj i own a deskjet performance isn t spectacular under windows using truetype fonts but neither is the canon from what i have seen quality for the hp is very much dependent on paper quality on standard photo copy paper the characters have slightly frayed edges but on better quality distinction type paper things look better for most applications i find copy paper fine still better than dot matrix comes with a windows driver which seems to by pass print manager has a few intelli fonts which are hp scaleable fonts probably faster than truetype but haven t really tried them out can get ram font cartridges but unless the speed of truetype is a problem i wouldn t bother the ram cartridges can t be used as buffer soft fonts only for graphics i e bmp images etc the hp can be put into a dither mode via the hp supplied win driver there a number of dither options such as scatter pattern etc the manual gives recommendations depending on the type of image being printed text is not so good in this mode problem arises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text the range of tones for graphic images isn t brilliant but i think that is more of a limitation with inkjet printers in general from what i have seen the canon is similar in most respects however a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from epson this printer is faster cheaper and capable of producing laser like quality on normal copier paper can t remember the model lx something i think i purchased my hp days before the epson was released here the introductory price on the epson was the same as the hp here in new zealand about a month ago i got a canon bj i absolutely love it it is incredibly fast except for printing from pspice i don t know if you ever do stuff with that or not most of the stuff i print is either from microsoft word for windows or just plain text the only problems i ve had are printing headers footers the printer freaked out and printing on cheap paper lots of streaks normal copy paper works great with it you can only tell it s not laser printed by holding it oh less than twelve inches from your face that is if you re nearsighted like me the printer comes with its own driver for windows i have no other complaints the printer also can act just like some epson or another for those archaic software packages that haven t written a driver for it yet the teeny weeny footprint is a real plus too and if you purchase it between now and may you get a rebate from canon i bought mine from a store called compusa and the price now is i have a friend who has the hp you are looking at it also prints very well and everyone has drivers for it but it is very slow hope i helped dpi sure looks great heather stehman in article apr schbbs mot com ceng maccvm corp mot com craig witkowski writes in

the printer first indicated it was receiving data as i used print manager in windows i guess i have some experience with both i have a bj at work and a deskjet at home i prefer the deskjet the printing speed and quality are similar i tested both with text and graphics before buying the deskjet for home the feature that sets the deskjet apart is the driver support in so many applications the bj ends up emulating the epson lq or ibm proprinter to get it to work with many non windows apps and this will be the case for a long time the design is superior if you just want to use cut paper the deskjet is quieter and the ink cartridges are quite a bit cheaper due to the number of deskjets out there in comparision to the bjs just my worth mike mattix agricultural group of monsanto p o box luling la internet address dmmatt bigez monsanto com yes there is the landscape mode printing problem but it does not present a problem in windows as the windows printer driver handles the translation i actually thought of some other points after i posted the note the deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately inch around the paper the bubblejet does not you are right about the graphics resolutions i tested the printers with the applications i had access to wordperfect harvard graphics wingif paintshop pro and paintbrush and could not tell a difference in fact one of the hp deskjet windows drivers gives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer hence controlling the amount of ink you put down the bubblejet did not i had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no comparision there finally i wanted sheet feeding in that configuration the bubblejet cost approximately more than the deskjet i went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the deskjet when i spent my own money btw i am replacing the bj with a deskjet at work this month anyway regards mike mattix ag group of monsanto luling la i spent some time comparing the two we ended up getting the bubblejet bj versus the hp our reasons were the hp seemed to have worse banding than the canon dpi versus we felt we could see the difference price canon has a rebate program going on at the moment the bj was our choice over the bj ex we could have pages in the bj feeder the bj ex holds only pages i think as you can see up to pages on the bj we haven t done anything big with the bj but its performance seems reasonable under windows i know that the microsoft bbs has a newer windows driver than comes with the printer but i don t know how it compares also the driver included with the printer is canon s whereas i don t know where the microsoft bbs one comes from microsoft hope this helps thomas v frauenhofer wa yyw tvf cci com uunet uupsi cci tvf tvf cs rit edu mandlebratwurst the meal that eats itself altough i m sometimes also a salesperson if i m not suppost to study i would recommend to buy the bj the printing quality is a bit better but you you ve got much more possiblities don t forget the hp engine is at least years on the marked the canon engine witch is also used in other new bubblejet printers like e g the epson ones is quite recently available now i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the dpi of the canon bubblejet vs the hewlett packard deskjet dpi which is faster is there a noticeable print quality difference particularly in graphics which will handle large documents better i ve seen during a short demonstration from someone who tryed to sell me canon printers times the same picture one printed with the bj one with the canon the other with the hp and there was a difference in printing quality the canon was a bit better greetz kris when we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to inkjet printers they have near laser quality speed and they are quiet we use both hp deskjets and the canon bj s i prefer the paper handling qualities of the deskjets but i feel the canons have superior print quality the ideal would be a canon with a sheet feeder however i did end up buying a deskjet for home use got too good a deal anyway we are using canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well out of deskjets and bj s i have only had one problem with a deskjet and that was taken care of very quickly by hp nate whenever i buy anything i look at what the experts say pick out the top few and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt i ve been unusually flush lately no begging letter please and so i ve done this a few times including about four months ago with inkjet printers i can t remember much about the process except that i read about three reviews of inkjets and that the was always at or near the top i bought the c because of the added dimension of colour i intend to build a multi media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner towards that although i haven s used the colour thing in earnest yet i tried it out on a couple of windows bitmaps and i was pleased with the result i note that even though you can now get the c the one with both colour and mono with no need to change the cartridge the c and are still readily available at least in the uk the following are my views experience i don t know anything about the canon except that i came away from reviews and replies to a posting similar to yours with the idea that the hp offered the best performance price ratio i believe hp are the originals in the field not always the ideal place to be but the market s still young so one assumes they have the expertise the c is worth the extra operation in mono is perfectly acceptable and i get good crisp reproduction of fonts from windows i used to work for monotype when they still manufactured typesetters before their american owners closed them down and i can tell you that in terms of definition dpi is pretty poor anyway so dpi is just a bit less poor the hp comes with a reasonable set of drivers if you buy it invest in the additional ram pack it s pretty slow with it god knows what it s like without i actually work in germany and my pc is home in the uk so it s not in daily use i would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and having a really dumb problem at the start it s easy peasy to operate hope this is of use regards david just bought the bj i thought the price couldn t be beat with rebate thru and so far it is comparable even superior to the deskjet in print quality speed per page rate seems to be faster i don t have figures i don t print long docs though quality i think the graphics quality is excellent print quality is excellent as well unless you use small fonts and hold it up close you can see a lot more jaggies than on a laserjet the dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the page print head in place i would imagine large docs not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages manual says up to though haven t tried it drivers no problems under win yet winword doesn t want to print the envelopes the same way the canon does though know nothing of add on costs daniel a hartung dhartung chinet chinet com ask me about rotaract the deskjet is slow this is in comparison to the other printers i mentioned i have no idea how the bubblejet compares the interface between win and the printer is just dandy i ve not had any problems with it i just bought a bj printer a couple of days ago i compared it to the sample print of an hp deskjet and knew that the hp wasn t for me the bj is pretty fast and really prints with good quality i can compare it with the hp laserjet iiid postscript and they look almost identical depending on the kind of paper i don t have problems with the ink not being dry it seems to dry very fast probably within a second since canon is giving a rebate until the end of may it is really a good buy sean eckton computer support representative college of fine arts and communications wow it s funny you should ask this i m a little behind in news reading so i know this may be late i just purchased the canon bubblejet last night i was really worried that i wouldn t like it but the print quality and noise level is fantastic i printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it printed damn near laser quality you can t tell it s not laser unless you get inches from the page no problems with drivers the printer came with the driver diskette which is good because i was beginning to panic when i couldn t findi it under windows or wordperfect it works well under both i have yet to install word for windows so don t know how it works with them i had a deskjet at work last year it was a good printer as well ut i felt it was awfully slow and much noisier than the bubblejet i won t say the bubblejet is much better but i really do like it more just my worth brett sincerely robert kayman kayman cs stanford edu or cpa cs stanford edu in theory theory and practice are the same in practice they are

question on eisa video board performance i have an eisa machine and i just do not understand why most eisa video cards only match the performance of their isa counterparts for instance the eisa orchid pro designer iis e is only about as fast as the isa diamond speedstar plus which isn t what i would call fast i don t understand why eisa video cards aren t as a group on the same level of performance as local bus cards given that eisa video cards have a bit bus to move data around instead of isa s bits since they are not why would anyone me included pay a higher cost for a eisa video card when its performance is no better than and often worse that a much cheaper isa video board such as a diamond speedstar x from pc magazine s i think recent report i know that ati makes a pretty fast eisa video card but it s around which is just about double what my wallet will allow me to spend and for i could get a diamond viper and still have left over of course i d have to get a local bus mother board too can anyone shed some light on my confusion frustration thanks christopher wroten cfw world std com

local windows vs shared windows discussion i would like to see a serious discussion on the best way to install windows from a novell administrator s point of view i just got off the phone with ms access support and was told that they microsoft has decided to implement as a standard for software support the local setup described below as the most advantageous installation if this is true and microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation then i will comply but i d like to hear it from administrators first the local windows installation windows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive assuming the resources are available from a network administrator s implementation he she would install all windows disks on a network drive using setup a then install windows on a per machine bases by running setup off the network to install the complete system on the local drives in this way all drivers are available to the setup procedure w o the need to change disks advantages reduce traffic running windows locally reduces network traffic due to the local access of main windows files network independence if the network fails and they all do at one point or another the local installation would allow users to keep producing and reduce the cost of down time faster windows theoretically windows will run faster from a local hard drive than over a network this may be a hard point to prove if the network has an optical backbone and or the network drives are significantly faster access than local ones a user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about varying setups monochrome color types of mouse etc since the windows installation is assigned to the workstation disadvantages cost installing windows locally requires a significant amount of disk space workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can increase the cost of the workstation from to percent administration local windows installations are very difficult to administer new drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available each of which would have to be individually installed on each workstation security users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system files from simple ignorance this could result in quite a headache for administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations backup we all know the problems backing up local hard disks the backup sets if done via a centralized tape system get very large very quickly backup individually to floppy may not happen at all this may be eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable applications and not user data the shared windows installation windows is fully installed to a network disk via the setup a procedure described above users or administrators then install a minimal set of files to individual user directories these directories may be on a local hard disk or perhaps a network home directory the bulk of the windows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory some files and are accessed shared as needed by users throughout their windows session the user s files consist of a small set of files that the user has updated during his her windows session these include group files ini files and other regularly updated files advantages a single location for all files makes updates to drives easy as an updated driver becomes available it only needs to be installed in this single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it assuming that the users files are maintained in network home directories the administrator can easily edit any ini file as needed to correct problems that may arise this includes win ini and system ini backup of all pertinent files is done easily even if the users files are on a local hard disk the bulk of the windows system is backed up with all driver updates disadvantages network traffic since all windows files are being shared in a network directory traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the speed of windows if the network crashes all production comes to a stop since window s is reliant upon the network for its files loss of data usually occurs as well since users working in windows at the time of the crash will usually not be able to save their work although minimal disk space is still a consideration if the users files are maintained on the network a large number of users can cause a significant utilization of disk space due to their personal windows files alone users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation hardware are similar this is due to the windows installation being tied to a particular username in the case of network user files the discussion i would like to know from other administrators with a large windows userbase how they prefer setting up windows personally i have setup numerous installations using the shared setup all windows and application files are on the network with little or no utilization of local hard disks in fact i sold a network on the fact that the company would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations and thus save that much more money i would also like to see recommendations for applications should apps such as word and or excel be installed locally regardless of how windows is installed again i keep all files on the network for easy backup and administration but this is putting all eggs in one basket if the network crashes work comes to a halt now i am sure microsoft and i know your out there has their own ideas about this and their insights would be of great value but i hope to hear from people with actual working experience with users and network administration

tcp ip through windows i don t know much about computers so please bear with me here s my question context i use a package called slip on my home computer to connect to the university mainframe an ibm running vms mvs and log on to my account when i installed slip on my computer i had to configure it for my modem kbs etronics internal and had to supply the phone number to dial to reach the mainframe the way it works now is that i type telnet uicvm or tn uicvm either will work at the dos prompt uicvm is the node name of the mainframe the program then dials the mainframe establishes a protocol and gives me the logon screen telnet and tn are the names of batch files in my slip directory i have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the session problem i would like to be able to do all this under windows because i hardly ever use dos directly slip will not run under windows i talked to the people at our computer center and they suggested that i use a packet driver called winpkt com with slip they gave me instructions on how to load it before i start windows and how to modify the tcpstart and tcpstop batch files in the slip directory to ensure that it would work i did all that and i could run slip from windows but there were other problems for one thing slip would not hang up the phone when i exited i had to run my communi cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when that didn t work for another there were too many errors it often took me tries to connect to the mainframe our computer center does not support slip under windows so i can t keep going back to them with more questions question is there some other shareware package that will run under windows and do what slip is supposed to do i need a package that is not too expensive which is why i am looking for shareware i have heard that there are regular commercial packages that do all this but they cost hundreds of dollars these are the main requirements must be able to run under windows must allow vt and ibm tn terminal emulation must allow ftp file transfers since that s the only kind the mainframe allows no y modem or z modem etc i believe the ftp transfers are made through a kermit protocol but i m hazy about that a subsidiary feature that would be nice to have if it s a true windows program rather than a dos program modified to run under windows is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet session and other applications any information received is appreciated pankaj saxena u uicvm uic edu

re question on eisa video board performance from article c ubg k w world std com by cfw world std com christopher f wroten i have an eisa machine and i just do not understand why most eisa video cards only match the performance of their isa counterparts for instance the eisa orchid pro designer iis e is only about as fast as the isa diamond speedstar plus which isn t what i would call fast i don t understand why eisa video cards aren t as a group on the same level of performance as local bus cards given that eisa video cards have a bit bus to move data around instead of isa s bits good question answer the eisa bus does move bits rather than isa s but it still moves it at about the speed as the isa bus i think that s either or mhz the local bus designs also move bits like the eisa but they move the data at the cpu speed up to mhz so on a mhz cpu the local bus is moving bit data at mhz and the eisa is moving bit data at or mhz so the local bus should be to times faster than eisa on a mhz cpu eisa should be about two maybe times as fast as isa since they are not why would anyone me included pay a higher cost for a eisa video card when its performance is no better than and often worse that a much cheaper isa video board such as a diamond speedstar x from pc magazine s i think recent report i know that ati makes a pretty fast eisa video card but it s around which is just about double what my wallet will allow me to spend and for i could get a diamond viper and still have left over of course i d have to get a local bus mother board too that s a very good question the eisa bus does have more advantages over the isa bus than just it s width for example more better interrupts and bus mastering but these other factors do not impact a video card very much they have more impact on file servers with multiple hard drives full throttle network cards cd roms etc can anyone shed some light on my confusion frustration thanks christopher wroten cfw world std com

precambrian electronics falstaff rd rochester ny thomask kodak com copyright march abstract the format of images created for use by ms windows applications is documented in the ms windows programmer s reference guide this guide is intended as a clearify some wording of the specifications and to put forth a recommendation among the various alternatives please send updates corrections suggestions and revisions to me please thank me for writing this on my own time by keeping my name with the document thank you for your respect this document copyright by thomas b kinsman if desired a postscript version of this document is available this information is free you get more than what you pay for don t sue me if i m wrong overview the dib image file format is intended to be a device independent bitmap file format what microsoft means by device independent is unclear to me four pixel resolutions are supported bit bit bit and bit pixels these images were intended for use on dos ibm or little endian systems if you are creating them on another architecture you will have to byte swap all short and long integer values by convention dib images end in the extension bmp this is because march they are a super set of earlier bitmap image files consequently you will sometimes hear dib files referred to as bmp files since dib images files are a super set there are three flavors of dib images o dos dib images these are the recommended convention and the form which i will describe how to create they are intended for applications running under ms windows in a dos environment o os dib images my understanding is that these are the flavor of dib images that were used by the presentation manager o old style bitmap images march differences between flavors the dos dib images consist of a bitmapfileheader file header which identifies the file as a dib file this header also gives the total size of the image file and the offset to the image data a bitmapinfoheader image header which specifies the image attributes an optional palette of colors used by the image if it exists this may contain or entries each entry is a windows rgbquad structure the image data itself the os dib images consist of the same bitmapfileheader file header which identifies the file as a dib file this header also gives the total size of the image file and the offset to the image data a bitmapcoreheader image header which specifies the image attributes an optional palette of colors used by the image again if this exists it may contain or entries each entry is a windows rgbtriple structure the image data itself the old style image bitmap consists of either a bitmapinfoheader or a bitmapcoreheader which header type is determined by the first long integer dword value an optional color palette this palette may be composed of either windows rgbquad structures if the header was a bitmapinfoheader or windows rgbtriple structures if the header was a bitmapcoreheader the image data itself creating dib image files creating a dos dib image file consists of several straight forward steps the headers need to be created and then written to the file these header structures are defined in the ms windows windows h include file palette information needs to be stored for images that are not bit images the five general steps are filling in the bitmapfileheader and the bitmapinfoheader structures the basic image information if the image is a bit bit or an bit image creating the color palette of rgbquads calculating the total file size and putting this information in march the bfsize field of the bitmapfileheader calculating the offset to the image data from the start of the file and putting this in the bfoffbits field of the bitmapfileheader writing to the file the bitmapfileheader the bitmapinfoheader the color palette and the image data in that order the following sections describe structures in terms of microsoft c type defined keywords the following table describes these keywords for those not familiar with microsoft c type defined keywords in microsoft c typedef meaning byte unsigned character word two byte unsigned integer dword four byte unsigned integer march the bitmapfileheader this structure is defined in windows h as typedef struct tagbitmapfileheader word bftype dword bfsize word bfreserved word bfreserved dword bfoffbits bitmapfileheader the bftype field is the two ascii characters b and m this serves to identify the file as a dib image file on an intel byte ordered machine ibm or a compatible this constant can be formed in c as the quantity m b x d on an intel system the bfsize field is the total size of the file for our purposes this field is equal to the size of the bitmapfileheader plus the size of the bitmapinfoheader plus the number of entries in the color palette times the size of a rgbquad plus the number of bytes of image data if the image data is being written out in an uncompressed form this value can be calculated ahead of time otherwise this field needs to be filled in later both the bfreserved and the bfreserved fields are always set to zero the bfoffbits field is set to the offset to the start of the image data from the start of the file for our purposes this field should be set to the size of the bitmapfileheader plus the size of the bitmapinfoheader plus the number of entries in the color palette times the size of a rgbquad this works out because the image data is written write after the color palette if one exists march the bitmapinfoheader this structure is defined in windows h as typedef struct tagbitmapinfoheader dword bisize dword biwidth dword biheight word biplanes word bibitcount dword bicompression dword bisizeimage dword bixpelspermeter dword biypelspermeter dword biclrused dword biclrimportant bitmapinfoheader the bisize field is set to the size of the bitmapinfoheader structure itself when reading the image file this value is what is used to determine that the image contains a bitmapinfoheader and not a bitmapcoreheader the biwidth field is the width of the image in image pixels the biheight field is the height of the image in image lines the biplanes field should always be set to this data is written out as if there was one color plane the bibitcount field is the bit depth of the image this must be either or depending on the bit depth of the image data the bicompression field tells how the image data is compressed if it is compressed dib images support two forms of run length encoding however i have never seen any images which use it and don t know yet how it works set this field to zero long zero or l to indicate that the data is not compressed all subsequent fields of the bitmapinfoheader structure may be set to zero a requirement of the interpretting software that it be able to compute these fields as necessary from the previous information the field which you might want to explicitly specify might be biclrused for bit and bit images this field indicates that not all of the possible color entries are used and that the image contains biclrused colors if you are using only colors with an bit image then you may only want to save of the possible palette entries generally set this field to zero march color palettes each entry of a color palette is a rgbquad structure the rgbquad structure is defined in the windows h include file as typedef struct tagrgbquad byte rgbblue byte rgbgreen byte rgbred byte rgbreserved rgbquad the rgbreserved field is always zero for each color used the amount of blue green and red are filled into the structure and the structure is written to the file a value of zero in the rgbblue rgbgreen or rgbred fields indicates that that particular component does not contribute to the color composition a value of in any of these fields indicates that the component contributes fully to the color composition image data there are three surprises about the ordering of image data in dib image file the creator of this format was determined to be creative and certainly was within the image data each line written out is padded to the next four byte quantity so if you had an bit image which was only one pixel wide you still have to write out four bytes for every image line the number of bytes per line can be calculated as bytes per line width in pix bit depth or in terms of the fields of the bitmapinfoheader structure bytes per line biwidth bibitcount when writing out your image data you must write it out bottom line first the bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the first line of image data in the file for bit bit and bit images information is written as you would expect one bit images are padded eight pixels to a byte four bit images are padded two pixels to a byte eight bit images are written one pixel per byte twenty four bit images are written three bytes per pixel however for bit images the information must be written out in the order blue green red while most image file formats write data out in march an rgb ordering a dib image file writes the data out in an bgr ordering summary this should provide enough information to create dib images from applications such as scanners or for image exporting routines if you find out any more about dib images please pass the information on to me so that i can modify

re challenge to microsoft supporters rsrodger wam umd edu yamanari writes i d say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare windows itself almost never crashes but it can be crashed by an errant application my personal favorite any one of the corel programs on the other hand i have had os crash randomly a number of times mostly just running it s own applications i do know that ibm systems the ps slc in particular have absolutely no problem with os never had a random crash while running any of my programs under os in fact i don t remember ever crashing of course i really don t run any os programs just the same bunch of dos and windows stuff that i ve always been running and when i had the slc this is the slc system running dos windows i had only one crash and it was consistent ftp had a tendency to crash whenever i would get large files mb from particularly fast clients dtr s k k sec i figured out the problem was with smartdrv s write buffering if i turned off the write buffer everything would work fine ftp under os has never locked though i can even format floppies to use the most often cited example of the superiority of os for instance i m still wondering why print preview in a windowed wp dos locks up my system yeah i guess i m willing to admit that os is somewhat sensitive to specific hardware wp for dos works perfectly fine on my slc please explain the only time i wait on anything under windows is when i m copying or formatting a floppy or when printing and even then not long i get to pages dumped to the printman per minute and can still go do things slowly while it s doing this i ve downloaded with pp while printing well i save all my personal files to floppy and when i did that under windows a floppy save of a large file hung up the system i also found it quite bothersome to have to continually tweak the tasking options on fractint for dos whenever i wanted to do a fractal computation in the background and not being able to address your memory better than dos not sure what you mean here the idea is that os s dos sessions can see more memory than windows dos sessions i let xpl a shareware calculus program see around kb of free conventional memory which lets me do bigger symbolic manipulations than is possible under straight dos where it would see around kb of conventional ram i also found it really handy for my own dos based programs which without any re writing could now handle larger data sets simulate for more iterations etc of course the point is now moot since the os programs i now write simply never run into memory limitations i never programmed for windows so i don t have much of a comparison here though

sample ftp session is given at the end of this file changes in version update from v to v in this version we have revised cosy pak to take advantage of the more robust signal processing functions available in mathematica v since mathematica provides a better and working laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform functions than mathematica v did we adopted them this has made cosy pak smaller thus brian evans signal processing packages that supported the laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform functions in the cosy pak v are no longer needed directly by cosy pak v for power users who use signal processing we still recommend the use of the very fine brian evans package on signal processing available at the anonymous ftp site gauss eedsp gatech edu or ip on the downside the disadvantage of this update can be that mathematica requires more runtime resources than its previous version for mathematica users we have included the laplacetransform package from mathematica in

engineering texts ogata phillips and harbor for undergraduate courses in control engineering i taught at the systems engineering department of cwru in addition to the next they have also been tested successfully on apple macintosh computers tm and ibm pc s tm running ms windows tm we would be very much interested to hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this software on platforms not mentioned above ibm users however will have to evaluate the notebooks first to visualize the graphics once installed see below for instructions this collection of mathematica packages can be loaded by any user bundled with the packages are many notebooks cosy notes which demonstrate the functionality of these packages the notebooks follow a plan of many fine standard undergraduate control engineering text books listed in the references examples used in these notebooks have been collected from the various references given at the end of this file the contents of the notebooks in the cosy notes directory are given below begin cosy notes contents notebook file name introduction ma chapter introduction to control systems sections analyticity poles and zeros signals forward laplace

re creating a batch file from windows nt in sasswb k sasswb unx sas com scott bass writes for windows nt is there an alternative to the archane fairly useless dos batch programming language for os ibm introduced the rexx language as an alternative to bat surely windows nt should do the same thing right in lieu of the above is there any way to escape the cr lf in a bat file and continue a single command across multiple lines i have an application which exits to the system and submits a batch file the batch file is created on the fly from site specific code stored within the application as currently designed the line length for the stored code and the output file bat file is characters which is not enough for all the options that must be specified on a particular command it would help tremendously if i didn t have to redesign my code to kludge around the lack of a true batch shell programming language rest deleted as a followup to my post let me add that i m not really a windows or windows nt user so please excuse my ignorance however i m a developer at sas institute and one component of the application that i support is the ability to submit a sas batch job from within an interactive sas session the user site can enter their site specific batch profile into a dataset within our product specifying the pathname to the sas executable specifying site specific sas options etc at run time certain variables are resolved and the resolved file is written to an external ascii file then i exit to the operating system and run the job asynchronously returning to the interactive session as soon as the job is submitted the batch job then runs concurrently with the interactive session as currently designed the internal dataset has a record length of characters but to run the batch job the command to reinvoke sas in batch mode requires more than characters up til nt this has not been a problem since every job control shell language up til nt eg mvs cms vms unix os had a way to escape the cr lf and enter a single command across multiple lines os via their rexx language which is standard with os the gist of all this is since this application is for end users not within my company i have to try to develop this process using native nt since my first posting i ve learned that there are several third party companies that provide alternative script languages for windows windows nt and i m sure a company that licenses our product would use that alternative script language if they had it but i can t develop under the assumption that they have anything other than what comes with nt i saw another post on this list the subject was something like is vi available for windows in which someone said that vi make awk and ksh was available with microsoft toolkit what is that product is it a separate product or part of windows ksh would do what i need if i could count on it at all nt sites one last question i ve heard that nt has remote processing capabilities i e i could shove this batch job off to a server machine and have it run there if these are native nt commands rather than network specific commands this would also help me improve this process if you can comment on these commands i would appreciate it thanks again for the help scott bass sas institute inc integrated systems a x sas campus drive cary nc sasswb k unx sas com x

re questions about dos external join command in article srg c i spud hyperion com the author writes i am setting up my dos unix box on a m ide and a m scsi drive and was wondering about the use of the ms dos join command i like the way it sets things up since i won t have to stick with the c d e crap that dos enforces i like how it would mimic mount points of unix filesystems i have heard that there were problems with using it or at least under older versions of dos please tell i have been using the join command for many years now mostly with good success in duplicating unix style file mounts you will hear lots of people cursing join because they confuse it with the dos append command a truely gnarly hack but don t believe them you also will hear people saying that microsoft recommends that you not use join but in microsoft s windows workgroups resource toolkit the following appears join an ms dos utility works fine with windows for workgroups if you do not change the state of the joined drives during a windows for workgroups session this includes adding or removing joined drives from within windows for workgroups we recommend that you do not use join when running windows setup or windows for workgroups within this caveat join appears to be valid under windows however i have found a couple of applications that don t deal well with filesystems that have been mounted using join in particular the worst offender is word for windows x it gets very confused when you edit and then try to save a file on a joined drive it wants to create the saved file as nnnnn tmp in the current dir then delete the old file and rename the nnnnn tmp file to the doc file unfortunately wfw usually writes the nnnnn tmp file in some idiotic place other than the current directory often in the root dir of the joined filesystem but not always then after deleting the original doc file it can t find the nnnnn tmp file to rename it unless you search your disk systems the document is gone i have also found subtle problems using the mks toolkit from a dos box when joined filesystems are present i used to join c temp with a meg ramdisk but mks sometimes gets confused when doing an ls on the c temp dir and misses some files in the temp dir this is difficult to reproduce but it goes away totally when join is not used i think this is a windows problem rather than mks s since it works ok under raw dos so i would suggest that you can use join but be aware that it may not be as robust you would like wouldn t it be real great to mount network drives i e z under the main file tree rather than having all those darned drive letters unfortunately join won t let you do it there was talk on the net about a simple patch to let join work on network drives but i don t remember the source it s too bad the join command is not better implemented since it would avoid using all those stupid drive letters i realize that messdos was meant for casual even ignorant users so mounting all the drives in one file tree might be confusing but it looks like ms is going to carry this over into windows nt another os meant for casual even igorant users not with all it s old family system baggage maybe ms needs a recovery group so they can get on with life jerome jerry schneider domain jls atg com aspen technology group uucp uunet csn atglab jls po box ft collins co voice

re mac disks in windows you re right you cannot read or write a mac or apple ii k disk or apple ii disk without extra hardware however mac mb disks can be read and written in a pc hd drive with software only this should probably be added to every pc and mac faq file it sure gets asked enough i agree that this should be added to some sort of faq list but we have strayed from the original topic our computer environment is pretty split between mac s and pc s i am lucky and get to have both on my desk but there are people who have pc s and need to share data with the mac users here the mac users have no problems because of package called dos mounter which automatically lets the mac read dos disks natively for the pc there is no equivilant that i know of both mac ette and macsee have been inconsistant under the dos platform and requires you to perform the activity in a dos program to selectively transport the files the question originally posed was if there is such a program that hooks into windows like a dll that will interpret the reading of a mac disk when it is in a pc and allow access to it through the standard file dialogs it is quite clear that this would only be available for the mb flopies t j fiske tfiske qualcomm com

experiences with dos i have been having trouble posting this article from within tin for over a week if you do get multiple copies my apologies here is a challenge to microsoft or microsort supporters to defend the pathetic state of dos as an upgrade distribution it is a long story but would make good reading for those who are interested in knowing the potential pitfalls of upgrading to dos that i have been able to notice after only about a week of playing around with it my envorinment ti travelmate winsx sx m ram m disk system bios version by texas instruments cl gd vga bios v a by cirrus logic quadtel advance power manager battery pro v b by texas instruments smart drive cache win dos parameters a b windows benchmark winbench tm v by zd labs after updgrading to dos i could not understand why certain things became so slow especially after i decided to try dblspace in the process of finding out why i discovered some interesting things disk performance with double space and smart drive while most things did not appear to slow down most of the time certain applications appeared to run very much slower what was interesting is that commands like chkdsk and defrag were running far too slowly to consider them useful by any standards i suspected double space ds and decided to measure its impact on my system using winbench tm the real disk winmark of for the original system as shipped from factory with dos and windowws became when upgraded to dos with ds thus there is an effective performance degradation of more than percent which did not really surprise me because i knew that ds compression must cost something specifically for short sequential reads up to bytes ds actually improves transfer rates by about because cpu being faster than i o more cpu cycles needed for ds is more than compensated by savings in i o cycles however for all other cases particularly large random writes the transfers take up to three times as long while the performance depends on the type of access i e random or sequential small or large transfer units on the average based on winbench s assumptions the disk slows down to half its speed the tests alone done in real mode see winbench and with smartdrv on do not say much except that it helps to put into those subjective statements like there is no noticable difference in performance or even that it will speed up disk access when you have a fast cpu and slow disk i o this explained why some applications ran markedly slower but not why chkdsk and defrag the latter especially too so long double space and windows dblspace will not run at all from within windows not even if you wanted to only to get information not modify anything or for that matter even check on its usage try fasthelp dblspace in a dos box within windows and you will see what i mean from the error message you get how narrow minded can a programer get i wonder yes this information can be obtained through the mstools dd add on to file manager but this mstools dll does not understand a compressed floppy use the dos supplement utility to create a compressed floppy if you dont know how to dos defragmenter is incompatible with ti apm defragmentation seemed to take too much time even so i waited patiently till it finished and then ran it again to just to confirm this confirmation dblspace def command for the m drive should take no more than seconds much faster on other defragmenters i have used but it took minutes i discovered that if i moved the mouse defragmentation checking ran faster the figure ticked more rapidly it dawned on me that this had to do with ti s battery saver advanced power management apm module which slows the clock down when it thinks that the cpu is idle and it obviously thought ds defragmentation was an idle process after disabling the ti s power saver this operation took only seconds microsft programmers think ti and gateway nomad users are idiots in the readme txt file you can find the the following running microsoft backup with ti and gateway nomad computers to avoid a conflict between the turbo feature and microsoft backup for windows or ms dos add a l switch to the device command in your config sys that loads the battery pro file or before you run microsoft backup type setpower l at the command prompt if you checked ti s manual on the l option you will realise that it means disable all power saving features of your notebook why would anyone want to run a driver disabled as i have found out not only does ti s power management interfere with microsoft backup as the readme txt claims but chkdsk and dblspace and who knows what else are crippled by the ti s power saver it is obvious that there is not such thing as apm specifications if there indeed is such a thing then either microsoft programmers or ti programmers dont know how to read these specifications you dont have to guess as to who are the idiots by the way if you run the advance power management utility power exe in dos when you check the status it says power management status setting adv max cpu idle of time this figure of seems to be the steady state value on my notebook when i am running nothing windows with only program manager in iconised form does that mean that windows takes up of my cpu all for itself and that i have at best only left for useful work is such an overhead justified whether or not windows is an operating system or just another user interface in dos alone it reports idle time looks like windows is a good example of busy waiting type of package that i like my students to study as the classical negative example of our times microsoft programmers do not know batch programming i like to structure my startup script and thus have the equivalent of addpath statements like this set path c dos set path c etc bin path c bin set path c etc windows path c windows set path path c bcc bin set path path mouse even though the new dos was installed in the same directory as the old one i e c dos dos installation program modifes each and every path statement and prepends c dos to its value as a result my resultant path has so many dos s if the installation program wanted to remove the old dos path and add the new dos path clearly it has to only scan for the path statement containg the old dos directory and replace it by the new dos path even this should only be done if the new dos is installed in a directory different from the old one being upgraded instead the microsoft programmer if you can call this person one decided to meddle every path statement i had in the autoexec and prepend dos to the value i wonder if microsoft is so desparate that it would not fire programmers who are incapable of the thought process i started a thread on this when dos came up and the microsoft representative in singapore called me about this poster in fact he specifically said his us counterparts saw the poster and relayed the information to him as he did not have access to internet now that has not changed one bit in fact if you have a path statement with path already in it is it not obvious that the this statement should not be touched for any reason as another example of the inability of microsoft programmers to understand batch programming i had the mouse driver invoked as set mouse c etc mouse set path path mouse loadhigh mouse mouse com guess what memmaker did it replaced the last statement with lh c etc mouse mouse com why is it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with lh and its parameters without touching the rest of the line i do not understand dos software quality dos is the only operating system i know in which under normal usage you end up creating a file that you cannot get rid of using of the commands that come with it i am deliberately being cryptic about this i challenge microsoft to use all its programmers to catch this bug and publish it if they dont within a week i will post how you can create this ghost file surely if i can pick this bug without even looking for it after using a particular command only twice i am sure two dozen microsoft idiot programmers randomly banging on their keyboards over a week could find it that is what i was told how microsoft tests the quality of their products i think it is funny that microsoft has found ways to test quality when it is accepted in the industry that quality cannot be tested but can only be built into the product no wonder they cannot provide any form of guarantees on their products not even a decent list of bugs that will prevent scores of user from destroying their disks beyond repair also if you run dblspace def often enough repeatedly when the disk is fully defragmented you may get errors that was created by the defragmenters i got my io sys file size error and it got truncated when i did the chkdsk this happend only after five successive defragmentation efforst after the first one supposedly did its job and with no new file creation since microsft dont

re ide cable vacsc qe vax csun edu wrote i just bought a new ide hard drive for my system to go with the one i already had my problem is this my system only had a ide cable for one drive so i had to buy cable with two drive connectors on it and consequently have to switch cables the problem is the new hard drive s manual refers to matching pin on the cable with both pin on the drive itself and pin on the ide card but for the life of me i cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug in the cable to align these most ide drives that i have dealt with have had pin labeled on the printed circuit board this is sufficient to determine which side is which if your ide drive does not have a label then you can look for a polarization notch in the receptacle the connector on the drive with the pins if the receptacle is center polarized that is it has one rectangular notch about mm wide positioned in the center of one side then you can identify pin as follows look into the pins with the notch at the top pin is at the top right on all drives i have seen this is toward the power connector as for which pin is pin on the controller well you can use the same criteria but look hard for the labelling of any pin once you know which end pin are on or pins the oposite end then you are all set all you need to do is keep the pin end connected to the pin end you don t even have to look at the cable itself just trace the pin side of the cable through usually the pin of the cable is identified by a different color red usually but beware many cable makers are not very careful about this i have seen cables with pin being the one marked red of course with non polarized connectors this doesn t matter you can plug the cable in either way and you decide which side is pin secondly the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them i figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into the drives does it matter which i plug into the master drive and which into the slave any help appreciated thanks it doesn t matter what gets plugged where but it does matter how the drives are jumpered there will be amongst other options two jumpers that you should be concerned with on both drives one jumper will select whether the drive is the slave or the master if it is the master then a second jumper selects whether or not a slave is present you will have to consult the docuementation that came with you drives if you do not have docuementation then just call the manufacturers hotline number or fax number if they have one this kind of information is routinely needed by people just like yourself they will fax you complete info about the jumpers if you don t have convenient access to a fax machine then you can usually get voice help or post the specific question to this group i probably won t be able to help you good luck gordon lang

re ip numbers on ethernet cards tigger djohnson moose uvm edu wrote hi is it possible through either pin configuration or through software programming to change the ip numbers on an ethernet card thanks in advance dave tigger djohnson moose uvm edu tiggers are wonderful things dave c johnson i think you mean the ethernet numbers the byte ethernet id is the unique electronic serial number esn assigned to each ethernet board in existence this is a physical layer concept the ip address is a higher layer protocol the analogy to telephone service is the ip address is your phone number while the particular wire pair in the cable on the pole has some unknown to you or i physical identification scheme number but to answer your question assuming you indeed meant the ethernet number it is not supposed to be possible to change the number of course the manufacturer can always retro fit a board but there could hardly be a reason to ever do that if your question is actually referring to the ip address it is most definetly changable but it is strictly software gordon lang

old keyboards never die hello i am almost ashame to ask this question it really looks like a faq but couldn t find the answer anyway the original ibm pc xt or key keyboard is in my opinion still the best keyboard around function keys on the right place eh left place firm click etc is there any chance to connect one of these to a modern at clone i do understand that the new at keyboard has more functionality i e the typematic repeat rate is programmable etc it seams to me that the pins electrical specs of the old and the new keyboard are however the same maybe the communication protocol is different please answer by e mail also if you can tell me that is absolutely impossible in that case i will bring the keyboard the museum of obsolete technology thanks duco duco fijma tel x university of twente fax x p o box internet fijma cs utwente nl ae enschede the netherlands no ugly pictures in this sig
re ide vs scsi dma and detach in article apr julian uwo ca wlsmith valve heart rri uwo ca wayne smith writes in article richk apr gozer grebyn com richk grebyn com richard krehbiel writes can anyone explain in fairly simple terms why if i get os i might need an scsi controler rather than an ide will performance suffer that much for a mb or so drive if i don t have a tape drive or cd rom any help would be appreciated so when you ve got multi tasking you want to increase performance by increasing the amount of overlapping you do one way is with dma or bus mastering either of these make it possible for i o devices to move their data into and out of memory without interrupting the cpu the alternative is for the cpu to move the data there are several scsi interface cards that allow dma and bus mastering how do you do bus mastering on the isa bus ide however is defined by the standard at interface created for the ibm pc at which requires the cpu to move all the data bytes with no dma if we re talking isa at bus here then you can only have dma channel active at any one time presumably transferring data from a single device so even though you can have at least devices on a scsi bus explain how all of those devices can to dma transfers through a single scsi card to the isa at bus at the same time think it s the scsi card doing the dma transfers not the disks the scsi card can do dma transfers containing data from any of the scsi devices it is attached when it wants to an important feature of scsi is the ability to detach a device this frees the scsi bus for other devices this is typically used in a multi tasking os to start transfers on several devices while each device is seeking the data the bus is free for other commands and data transfers when the devices are ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data on an ide bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked the data and transfered it this is typically a ms second lock out for other processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time also i m still trying to track down a copy of ibm s at reference book but from their pc technical manual page the fdd adapter is buffered on the i o bus and uses the system board direct memory access dma for record data transfers i expect to see something similar for the pc at hdd adapter so the lowly low density original pc fdd card used dma and the pc at hdd controller doesn t that makes real sense guy dawson hoskyns group plc guyd hoskyns co uk tel hoskyns uk guyd austin ibm com tel ibm austin usa

bit dma failure system halted i have a mhz isa board with kbyte cache and megs ram i just bought the new soundblaster and tried to install the card the sb uses bit dma channel i could select between channel to it is the first card i ever installed that uses bit dma transfer after i tested the card the first time the computer crashed and i got a parity error system halted this happens either from dos as also from windows so it seems that my bit dma channels are not working properly they are there because testsb exe recocnize them and tests them ok until first access well does anybody know a solution for this problem or a special test program for dma problems i eliminated the problem temporaly by using only bit dma channel but it makes the system slow thanks for your help yours markus
re parity error system halted anyone have any ideas you unfortunately failed to mention if the error occurs with the parity error checking enabled or disabled i assume you mean it gives you a parity error when it s enabled and not when it s disabled how high will the count go on the memory check at boot up before this error occurs does the system beep at all if so what s the pattern of beeps the error could be occuring in cache memory not so likely or video memory as well as the simms the fact that you have ami bios is not conclusive in determining the board manufacturer either boards are made by thousands of small taiwanese companies among others that buy the name brand chips and put them together with some simm sockets to make your board i tend to doubt your problem is with your ide controller also anyway perhaps if you answer those questions someone can help you out better mrb boltz vivaldi psu edu mrb psuvm psu edu

re how is a null modem cable kevin kimmell computer science german undergrad ke kimmell vax cns muskingum edu wrote i am interrested in the extrodinarily simple concept of the null modem cable actually i have no idea so don t count that last statement what i m asking is what pins does it use or what are it s specifications i just want to solder one myself instead of buying one i don t even know what port is used help me please at ke kimmell vax cns muskingum edu kevin p s i m intending to use the cable for pc to pc transfers via lap link or telix ideas and info gladly accepted i do not have specific knowledge of lap link or telix but my recommendation for any package is to follow each one s instructions for making the null modem cable the reason is that each one may be different since there isn t really a standard for pc to pc communications the following is a tutorial i wrote up that will give you an understanding about rs and null modems but you should still check your software i will eplain a couple of details of rs rs is a commumications specification for communicating between a computer and a modem actually it can be between any end system and any communications hardware the terminology used is data terminal equipment dte and data communications equipment dce rs spells out the voltage levels the connector type the pinouts and the signal protocols the connector is a db but ibm has set an alternative standard of db the primary signals are transmit data td recieve data rd and signal ground sg there are other signals that provide control between the dte and the dce for example the dte announces that it is powered up and ready to participate in communications via the data terminal ready dtr signal dtr is an output on the dte and an input on the dce similarly the dce announces that it is ready to participate in communications via the data set ready dsr signal dsr is an input on the dte and an output on the dce ok that s five signals there are only four more of interest the request to send rts signal is an output from the dte and an input to the dce that is used to ask the dce permission to send data if the dce agrees it sends an ok via the clear to send cts signal for completeness the cts is an input to the dte and an output from the dce the other two signals of interest are ring indicator ri and data carrier detect dcd these are both inputs to the dte and outputs from the dce ri is just what you would expect a signal to the dte saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection to the dce this is rather specific to the modem telephone line setup dcd is a way for the dce to announce that the connection has been established i e the local dce is talking to some remote dce there that s it oh there are many other rs signals defined but they are obsolete i have explained the nine signals that are on a pc the pinouts are as follows name db db sg td rd dtr dsr dcd rts cts ri now to address your problem at hand when you connect a pc to a pc a dte to a dte there is no dce pair in the middle and therefore the rs signal definitions don t work out quite right there is no dce to assert the cts dsr dcd or ri so the common thing to do is to not use these signals at all and also forget about the dtr and rts outputs as well if this is done you simply make a null modem a cable that passes through sg and crosses td and rd i e pin of one end connects to pin at the other end etc the problem with this solution is that a pc that wants to send data has no way of knowing if the other pc is ready it would have to just send the data and hope it got through therefore a better null modem would include the dtr dsr pair crossed a particular point a confusion is in the software area just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft ware will use them if you are using the built in bios to control the serial port then the bios dictates what wires you need and how they are to be used but if you have a comm package such as brooklyn bridge or lap link or telix then those packages dictate the cabling requirements the only thing you can guess reliably is the sg td and rd the dtr dsr is also fairly common there is one more issue that needs to be addressed here and that is flow control in the rs scenerio the dce s are responsible for flow control and it is assumed that the dce couldn t possible over run the dte by this i mean that as long as the dte has its dtr line asserted the dce will send data without requesting permission first note the contrast to the other direction of data flow the dte must request permission by asserting the rts line and it must wait for the cts signal before it can send and now in the dte to dte scenerio the question is do you need flow control the answser is usually but how for non binary communications one common technique is xon xoff which is implemented in software no wires are dedicated to flow control the td and rd carry the xon and xoff commands this type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware flow control but the problem is that you can t send binary data because your data might include the xon or xoff codes and cause erroneous conrol signals a work around is to have the software insert and extract escape codes but the hardware flow control is prefered the problem with hard ware flow control is that there is no standard there are lots of ways to do it and i bet they have all been tried one cornerstone of all the methods is to use the rts cts for one direction but beyond that anything is fair game again you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements but i bet you ll find that one cable if wired properly could work with all of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage by the way i am familiar with one package that uses rts cts and dtr dsr for flow control the rts is request to send and the dtr is ready to recieve the cts is the clear to send and the dsr is the request to recieve this does not mean a differnt cable it is just software the clincher to all of this cabling stuff is that it is common to have the uart directly controlled by the cts signal which means that the cts must be present even if you are not support ing it in software for these cases you will find cables that short the rts to the cts at the same end or perhaps the dtr to the cts other possible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain signals that you don t have or don t feel like providing because it would mean additional wires specifically i am talking about the dsr shorting the dtr to the dsr is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like this it is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose one more gotcha signal is the dcd some software including the pc bios expects to see the dcd before it will work this signal sometimes gets shorted with the dtr but my favorite null modem has the rts and cts shorted at each end but the rts is also connected through to the other end and connected to dcd and of course the dtr dsr are crossed as are the td rd and of course the sg must pass through this null modem works with most software the flow control if any can use the rts dcd with the dtr dsr if your comm package does not specify the cable required for pc to pc connection then i suggest you use this one td rd rd td dtr dsr dsr dtr dcd rts rts dcd cts cts

re ide vs scsi wlsmith valve heart rri uwo ca wayne smith writes wayne amtower spacecoast org writes ide also uses dma techniques i believe floppy controller also uses dma and most a d boards also use dma dma is no big deal and has nothing to do directly with scsi no the simple style ide controller does not use dma the cpu performs the data transfer with a string move instruction this requires that the cpu stop what it had been doing and transfer the data only the smart drive controllers be they ide or scsi can transfer via dma these controllers tend to cost the same wether they are ide or scsi to get the dma benefits ide must sacrifice it s price advantage on the controller for example when rewinding or formatting a tape the command is issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other devices on the bus this greatly increases productivity or at least do something else while backing up your hard drive which happens to be what i am doing while reading this group you can thank your software for that if dos had a few more brains it could format floppies etc while you were doing something else the hardware will support it but dos at least won t again this has nothing to do with scsi floppies aren t on the ide bus your arguement makes no sense this isn t an ide issue the floppys have their own processor on their controller board which handles all of these commands the difference between ide and scsi is that all scsi peripherials are intelligent they each have their own controller they depend on the cpu to do fewer things for them i e ide drives needing a processor to transfer their data its a long story but i still use ide on my except for the cdrom which thanks to scsi i can move between both machines if and when scsi is better standardized and supported on the ibm clone machines i plan to completely get rid of ide and if you stick with dos you ll wonder why you can t multitask again i ask why can t a unix or os type os do all the miraculous things with an ide harddrive that it can with a single scsi hard drive the dettach callback mechanism alows the cpu to make requests of the devices on the scsi bus and then dettach and go about its business later when the device is done it issues a callback to say that the data has arrived or the function has completed most scsi cards will also dma the data into memory without the interupting the cpu therefore allowing it to continue working uninterupted ide supports no such concept as dettach callback can you see how this would be a win in any multitasking system david willmore willmore iastate edu death before dishonor better dead than greek david willmore ever noticed how much they look like orchids lovely

upgrading the processor on machines in case anyone was wondering about upgrading their or class machine without spending a lot of money i looked into replacing the processor on those machines and here are the facts as i understand them if you have a ps model or model you can replace the i chip with either a cyrix dlc chip for which will increase your processing power by about for normal fuctions and not at all for math functions this chip will only run at your original clock speed ie if you have a mhz machine the cyrix dlc will run at mhz note windows does not use the math functions so it is a good upgrade if you are running windows or you can get a kingston now platform for with a mhz i sx on it which will increase your normal processing power by about if you were running at mhz originally but again it will not increase the speed of your math fuctions i think that it will continue to run at mhz even if your original processor runs at a slower speed there is also the kingston now platform for with a mhz i dx on it this might speed up your math functions as well but i am not sure if you have a ps model b or other ps machine with either an i sx or a non clock doubling i dx ie it runs at either or mhz in it then you can get an intel overdrive chip which is really an i dx chip and replace your chip with it you should get about better preformance for both normal and math functions the mhz version of the overdrive chip costs and the mhz version costs the replacement for the mhz sx chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math coprocessor which the sx does not have note that the speed ratings on the overdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run if you have a mhz sx then the overdrive chip will run at mhz ie mhz externally and mhz internally there is no reason to buy an overdrive chip which is rated at faster then your machine you will not get faster performance you should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that advertise at the back of pc magazine or pc week you might want to shop around as prices do vary if you need a name phone number for a source for a particular chip e mail me and i will respond with a couple of sources lawrence khoo khoo husc harvard edu lawrence khoo computer consultant khoo haavelmo harvard edu econ dept harvard u

to their senders or for which no clarification is provided will be identified in the final vote tally every vote counts feel free to flood my mail rationale the rationale for this proposal is a need for those interested or involved in the publishing of cdrom materials to have a forum for the discussion relating to their needs at the moment the main fora for such discussion are in alt cd rom and comp multimedia neither of which have publishing as their focus some lists serve the general cdrom community with focuses on library government and network usage and until several weeks ago none were devoted to publishing cdpub has just been setup in any case a list is not and ought not be a replacement for regular usenet newsgroups the reason for the division into three groups is a natural partition of interest between the hardware and software topics and between the two main focal points of software i e fulltext and multimedia publishing topics such as cdrom xa cdi cd r photo cd and other related formats would be included as well topics related to cdrom publishing that are neither clearly hardware or software related such as books copyright issues and other legal matters packaging distribution could be included in the purvue of comp publish cdrom software as would any other nonhardware or multimedia topic that relates in some way to cdrom publishing in any format and is appropriate to the internet the main focus of comp publish cdrom software would be topics such as index and retrieval software premastering software cdrom simulation software hypertext sgml scanning and imaging software data capture software data clean up compression encryption etc as relates to publishing cdroms the main focus of comp publish cdrom multimedia would be software that aids in the multimedia authoring and publishing process audio and video the main focus of comp publish cdrom hardware would be hardware that relates to cdrom publishing as well as hardware for data capture such as all sorts of scanners and data capture hardware as well as information that publishers need to know about the hardware that the intended enduser will utilize the hardware that will eventually play the published cdrom including networks for cdrom notes these groups are not to be used for topics such as reviews or questions relating to already published cdroms or reviews or questions relating to general purpose cdrom drives and the like requests for help in installing a cdrom drive and other general topics should be directed to other fora questions about cdroms mounted on lans

if the sportster line is fully dsp driven like the more recent courier modems are so upgrades in the future may be an issue again take all of the above with a grain of salt i ve never evaluated the sportster so i m going by bits and pieces that i ve heard if you want a real answer post the question in comp dcom modems and you ll find people who have worked with the sportster personally though if i were going to look at the courier modems i d buy the dual standard then i d get both hst and v bis in fact this is exactly what i did i m sitting here looking at my usr ds right now and now to correct a few very incorrect statements folks if you want to get reliable answers to modem and or uart questions post them to comp dcom modems if you post in other groups you never know what you ll get in the way of an answer you may very well get a good answer or you may get something like the one below at least in cdm if someone posts complete and utter bs you ll see a flurry of folks correcting them to avoid spreading faulty info the sportster at has v error control and v bis data compression just as it does at lower speeds too there is absolutely nothing in either ccitt recommendation v or v bis that says that they can only operate on modems that are running v bis v bis of course is currently only standardized for operation on top of v in its primary mode of operation lapm but that s about as far as that goes and just in case there s some confusion on this v v bis are also supported by the courier line unless you have a really ancient one the difference with the courier is that it can run at and only in the hst mode take a second look at the original question in a previous article cs sd ae maccs mcmaster ca holly ks says what is the difference between the us robotics courier v bis external see the v bis up there the question was not about the courier hst modem or about the courier dual standard it was about the courier v bis modem the modem in question does not support hst period it therefore does not support the kb hst also not all courier hst courier dual standard modems support the kb version of hst my dual standard only supports hst at kb there are even older models that only run hst at kb this is a proprietary mode of usr and it will only connect to another of the same type unit to achieve this speed hst is usr s proprietary modulation scheme but we re not talking about hst we re talking about v bis v bis is most definitely not a proprietary modulation scheme the sportster will do asynchronous transmissions as well as synchronous the hst is one way only i do hope you didn t mean for these two sentences to be related in some way first off v and v bis are both synchronous and asynchronous this is part of the ccitt recommendation i e part of the standard it isn t a feature unique to the sportster i just looked at the appropriate chapter in the courier ds manual second hst is not one way only more correctly put it is an asymmetrical modulation scheme meaning it doesn t work at the same speed in both directions hst operates at in one direction and has a low speed back channel in the other direction the high speed channel goes in the direction of the higher data flow this is fine if you re logged on to say a bbs and type one letter and get screens of info back transfer files not using bimodem etc there is of course a penalty for turnaround time when the high speed channel needs to reverse directions v and v bis are both symmetrical meaning they do transfer the full data rate in both directions at the same time third synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do with symmetrical vs asymmetrical they are two completely different topics the hst s will be upgradeable to the v fast spec when it is available again more correctly put some of the courier line will be upgradeable to whatever v fast is called when it s complete if you have the large footprint courier modems like i do you re s o l there was an upgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety which could eventually be upgraded to support v fast but the cost of the two upgrades together pretty much put it

re any info on cyrix dru chip it seems that there are a lot of questions regarding the cyrix compatible dlc and dru my info comes directly from cyrix s fast fax service and also from installing one of these chips in an ibm model the dlc is a instruction set compatible cpu which fits into a dx socket pin grid array or pga the dlc currently is available in speeds the the and the they do not have a coprocessor on board but any software query will return coproc as present i guess they emulate the coproc instructions math functions are on the dx level without the actual coprocessor the internal cache on the dlc is k cyrix literature claims a hit rate my informal tests show that the cache accounts for a performance boost when it is enabled by software overall performance boost from a dx to a dlc is about the benchmarks i used were nu si and qaplus dhrystones and whetstones the performance with the cache enabled is about on a par with my dx with k external cpu cache which is around the performance for a sx the computer runs noticebly faster and dos with dblspace is not complaining the company claims os compatibility but i didn t test it the dru is not a chip as commonly thought the dru is actually a small daughterboard slightly larger than the dx which contains the logic to manage the clock doubler this board plugs into the dx pga and the dlc or plugs into this board i guess the board doubles the frequency apparent to the cpu and insert wait states when access to the rest of the system is required there are no info available from cyrix there anyway the dru is available for dx and dx only double these clock rates and you get the mhz and the mhz dlcs if cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the dru then they need to put out the mhz dlc first i also tested a dlc motherboard along with a cyrix coprocessor with k external cache performance were about faster than the but still significantly slower than an actual intel dx imho the dlc is a great low price upgrade for people who can t afford or can t install a new motherboard it is definitely worth what i paid for it but if you need dx performance the dlc won t cut it i m not sure about the dlc but i think even if it matches the performance it won t beat it in any significant way the last time i posted info about the dlc people sent quite a bit of mail asking where i got it so here is where i got mine treasure chest peripherals they advertise in the computer shopper the dlc kit was but i liked the chip so much that i found the supplier and became a dealer if you are interested in the chip e mail me and i can fax or mail you more info i m well aware of the net s policy against commercial use so i can t post anymore info here however if there are more questions regarding the dlc itself i ll post what i can jamesc if someone asks if you are a god you say yes

re help adding a scsi drive can it coexist with an ide eric bosco ebosco us oracle com wrote first of all please edit your postings wading through lines of quoted crud which people have already read makes people much less likely to help you of course if you don t want to be helped that s your problem is this true i was under the impression that people on the net had both scsi and ide working together no it s not true you can get scsi and ide to work together but there are restrictions at least with the adaptec you must boot from the ide drive there is no way to boot from the scsi drive if you have both ide and scsi drives you must disable the scsi rom bios i m not sure about this though and so you must also use some special drivers to access the scsi drive hmm i know that you have to disable something related to the scsi bios but i m not sure if it is the rom itself back in february someone asked about ide and scsi this question gets asked again and again at the end of this message i ve included an edited copy of my reply you might find it interesting darryl okahata internet darrylo sr hp com disclaimer this message is the author s personal opinion and does not constitute the support opinion or policy of hewlett packard or of the little green men that have been following him all day is it worth it to get scsi over ide will there be a noticable decrease in access time increase in xfer rate for msdos applications isa based scsi and ide controllers generally have comparable throughput you might get slightly higher throughput with a scsi disk but you ll also pay more for the disk and up in some cases you ll also pay much much more for a good scsi controller note that good scsi controllers really show their power if they re used with a good multitasking operating system like a pc unix unfortunately neither msdos nor windows is a good multitasking operating system the performance advantage of scsi controllers is mostly wasted with these which leaves the advantage of being able to connect multiple devices to the scsi bus as the only advantage however note that you can expect to pay a premium for scsi devices if you re only going to be using msdos stick with ide it s cheaper and you ll have less headaches will virtually any scsi device chain into the controller for my hard drive bernoulli box cd rom tape drive etc note the following is true for msdos windows only who knows what the future holds for windows nt and unix no generally you have to find drivers for each scsi device which probably don t exist unless you re using one of the better high performance scsi controllers these are typically bus mastering scsi controllers that cost around street prices and up and drivers that allow you to connect these controllers to popular name brand scsi devices either come with the card or can be purchased for under list price examples of such driver kits are adaptec s ez scsi kit list this works only with adaptec scsi controllers corelscsi from the same people who make coreldraw list this driver kit will supposedly work with any scsi controller card that has an aspi driver like the adaptec central point s pc tools for dos supports a number of scsi tape drives the documentation lists tape drives unfortunately it works only with adaptec controllers are there likely to be other problems incompatibilities with a scsi controller and sound cards video accelerators and similar equipment yes you will run into problems if you re using a high performance bus mastering scsi controller this doesn t sound right doesn t it it s true though with one of these controllers you ll probably have to tweak your system to get it to work with sound cards floppy controller based tape drives like the cms jumbo and windows i know i ve been to h ll and back getting my scsi controller to work with various hardware software thank god for tape backups if you want a copy of my adaptec hints and tips file send email these problems aren t really the fault of the scsi controller card the problems are really with the general hardware and software design of the pc e g no standards however adding a bus mastering scsi card is what brings these problems to the surface and makes them visible scsi holds a lot of promise but you can run into a lot of pc compatibility problems if you re planning on using only msdos windows stick with ide if you want to use windows nt or a pc unix you ll have to make some hard decisions a good scsi controller and more than one scsi hard disk will probably give you excellent performance at the possible cost of msdos compatibility i say probably because while i know this to be true with a pc unix i don t know if this really will be true of windows nt i suspect that it will but i don t know for sure

re soundblaster irq and port settings pdb ipl jpl nasa gov paul bartholomew writes clip clip interesting would you care to explain to me then how my soundblaster pro card and my printer card are sharing irq successfully i assure you that they are both set to irq and that i have no problem my computer is a dtk ibm clone running ms dos or a derivative os obviously please take note that the following is not what exactly happens but a slightly simplified explanation technically the irq line is only a means for the device printer adapter soundblaster modem hard disk to signal the cpu that something s happening here please take note how the cpu is programmed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system in ms dos the interrupt vector is used to store the address of the function that handles each interrupt now basic dos doesn t care whether the printer reports that it s ready to print some more stuff or not it simply ignores the interrupt when dos prints it looks at the lpt buffer if there s a character there wait a while and check again if there s not copy a new character to the lpt port since the irq is ignored as a printer interrupt it s free for use for any other adapters in this case the sb with any multitasking or otherwise advanced os this kind of printing approach just doesn t work or more precisely it wastes a lot of cpu cycles hence you can t share the irq with lpt and sb if you re running unix or os or whatnot another issue with the sb is that only the digitized sound uses interrupts when the sb plays plain music the cpu simply tells it what to play until told otherwise with digitized sound the interrupt is required to notify the cpu when the output ends and new data is needed you can however hook two or more com ports to one interrupt but use them only one at a time this is because the interrupt handling routine is same for both ports and it can see from which port the data came from this of course applies for some other devices like lpt as well remember this was greatly simplified in parts but i think gives the general picture correctly enough cheers juha liukkonen aka jliukkon cc helsinki fi university of helsinki dept of lost souls trust me i know what i m doing sledge hammer

hercules vlb a couple of months ago i tried out a hercules graphite card a pretty nice board fairly fast and seemed quite compatible even seemed to handle the svga modes i have whined about here on occasion at the time i was just buying a vlb system so after checking out the card i sent it back i wanted a vlb card and purchased a fahrenheit vlb card this card is fairly fast will do hz refresh at x but is not compatible with my cd roms the svga thing i think i have merely conjectured that is the cause of an old graphics board being able to run in a higher resolution with those programs than the modern boards i have tried i have not gotten a straight answer out of anybody the monitor i am using it with is a magnavox which also tops out at x x hz so its really a pretty good match but that is for my wife i just purchased a viewsonic for myself and am looking for a graphics card to drive it i want hz refresh and would really like it to handle my cd roms i tried the orchid p which did neither of those things though robert at wietek did say that the hz was possible if i modifed the driver data base so my thoughts go back to hercules they were supposed to be coming out with a vlb version of the graphite around the end of march i have heard precisely zero about it since then does anyone know if the card was actually released and what capabilities and price it has any info would be most appreciated geoff sherwood

re diamond stealth giving winmarks in article netnews upenn edu balog eniac seas upenn edu eric j balog writes when posting winmark results it is a good idea to give the version of winbench that you used to obtain the scores as well as the resolution that you tested and the version of the drivers doesn t anybody actually read the licence agreement of winbench before blindly running it the licence agreement very clearly says that details about hardware configuration driver resolution and other relevant facts must be included when giving winmark results ziff davis wants everybody to do this and that requirement makes sense really plain numbers are useless when resolution driver and machine are unknown pekka taipale hut fi

re soundblaster irq and port settings discussing the use of irq in recent article msprague superior mcwbst b mike sprague writes i as a number of poeple in this thread have already written i can t prove it s true but i believe it lpt does not actually use irq even though that interrupt is supposed to be dedicated to lpt to put it a little differently irq is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity dos doesn t monitor irq it uses other means to determine when it s time to send out another byte to the printer most all hardware printer adapters have the ability to disable the use of irq usually by merely breaking the connection between the isa pin and the associated driver other adapters control the irq line by a tri state driver and by programming just leave it in the high impedence mode unfortunately there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate drivers i e either assert high or assert low for the irq lines rather than tristate drivers assert high assert low or don t assert anything the presence of such a card on an irq line precludes the use of that irq by any other adapter unless it is physically disconnected by a jumper incidentally note that there s no requirement that a card hold the irq line low when no interrupt is desired if that were true you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected irq lines and that certainly isn t a requirement non dos operating systems os nt various unices or whatever the proper plural of unix might be require the use of irq for performance reasons and the sb alas is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers joe morris mitre jcmorris mitre org

re cpu fans russest ampex com steve russell writes deletions the attached fans look slick and work well but i m bothered by the potential loss of cooling if the fan goes out at least with the power supply fan you can reach back there every few days and feel the fan blowing yes this is a valid concern imho with the directly attached fan units i ve seen it looks like if the fan were to stop the chip cooling would be a good bit worse than no heat sink at all in other words if the fan stops the unit turns into an insulator and the chip might get hot enough to suffer permanent damage not just stop working temporarily i prefer to put a stock fan off the drive brackets or front panel to blow air across the cpu depends a lot on case and board layout though my zeos dx tower case has a passive heat sink on the cpu and it s located so the front fan which sucks air into the case blows right on the heat sink if that fan stops the heat sink is still cooled by convection air flow so should not see too dramatic a temperature rise essentially the arrangement you re talking about and a good idea imho on chip fans from fry s electronics in the sf bay area are about i get the stock power supply fans for about steve al devilbiss al col hp com

cpu temperature vs cpu activity organization compact solutions canberra act australia this may be a very naive question but is there any basis for the claim that a cpu will get hotter when a computationally intensive job is running my friend claims that there will be little difference in the temperature of an idle cpu and a cpu running a computationally intensive job from what i ve seen in coursework most cpus never actually idle they will continue to service interrupts etc etc the clock will always be running at n mhz no matter what it s doing i suppose depending on the instruction the cpu may use circuitry which has more transistors than other instructions but if you consider the additional heat generated by only a handful of additional tiny resistors and then spread that heat dissipation over the cpu s packaging the change in temperature to the immediate environment ie the surface of the package will be negligible cheers ben ben j elliston bachelor of engineering computer engineering university of canberra ooo ooo email compsol fir canberra edu au v also ellib cbr cpsg com au uucp uunet munnari sserve adfa oz au compsol root fidonet origin compact solutions canberra act australia

instructions i have a question congratulations you ve come to the right place usenet is a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions how do i lock a floppy disk to queries that would make steve jobs himself run screaming from the room in terror i used resedit to remove resources init wdef and nvir from my system file and used the hex editor to add code string a b as a patch to the sfgetfile routine so the standard file dialog box would be a nice shade of mauve everything worked fine until i installed supercdevblaster and now when i use the aldus driver to print from pagemaker d to a linotronic my system hangs p s i m running system on a powerbook since the macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume we ask that you first peruse this faq list including at least the table of contents for the other pieces of it check any other relevant on line resources listed below in question especially the faq lists for the other macintosh newsgroups and rtfm read the friendly manual before posting your question we realize that you are personally incensed that the system is taking up fourteen of your newly installed twenty megs of ram but this question has already made its way around the world three hundred times before and it s developing tired feet finally before posting to any newsgroup macintosh or otherwise please familiarize yourself with the basic etiquette of usenet as described in the newsgroup news announce newusers how do i use this document where can i get it comp sys mac faq is currently divided into multiple pieces a general introduction which you re reading now and specific lists for the newsgroups comp sys mac system and comp sys mac misc faq lists for comp sys mac wanted comp sys mac apps and comp sys mac hardware are in development when ready each part will be available in its respective newsgroup all pieces are available via anonymous ftp from rtfm mit edu in the pub usenet news answers macintosh directory except for this document itself which is named general faq z the pieces are named as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover followed by faq e g system faq z misc faq z the z means the file is stored compressed so you ll need to ftp it in binary mode and use either maccompress stuffit deluxe or the unix uncompress command to decompress it however if you leave off the z extension when you get the file rtfm will automatically decompress the file before sending it to you this introductory document is posted to all of the concerned newsgroups the tables of contents for each of the specific faq lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to get at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere else in the faq even if you don t have the other parts at hand it s not always obvious especially to newcomers where a particular question or comment should be posted please familiarize yourself with the faq lists in all the major macintosh newsgroups before posting in any of them which questions appear in which faqs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong where to jump to a particular question search for section number question number enclosed in parentheses for example to find where can i ftp macintosh software search for the string to jump to a section instead of a question use a zero for the question number what other information is available comp sys mac faq provides short answers to a number of frequently asked questions appropriate for the usenet newsgroup comp sys mac misc and comp sys mac system four other files are worthy of particular note daryl spitzer maintains a faq list covering macintosh programming for the newsgroup comp sys mac programmer it s posted to that group weekly and available for anonymous ftp from ftp cs uoregon in pub mac eric rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list for comp sys mac comm available in that newsgroup and from rascal ics utexas edu in mac faq where the file you re reading now is also irregularly archived this list answers many frequently asked questions about networking unix and the mac telecommunications and foreign file formats norm walsh has compiled an excellent faq for comp fonts that answers a lot of questions about the various kinds of fonts and cross platform conversion and printing it s available in comp fonts or by ftp from ibis cs umass edu in pub norm comp fonts faq finally jim jagielski maintains a faq for comp unix aux covering apple s unix environment a ux it s posted every to weeks in comp unix aux and news answers it s available for anonymous ftp at jagubox gsfc nasa gov which newsgroup should i post to there are no stupid questions but there are misplaced ones you wouldn t ask your english teacher how to do the definite integral of ln x between zero and one would you so don t ask the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when microsoft word is in the background ignorance of basic netiquette is not an excuse if you want people to help you you need to learn their ways of communicating posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your mailbox with pearls of wisdom and maybe a few rotten oysters too posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering silence for instance the most common and glaring mispost one that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the macintosh regions of usenet as would a purple elephant to aleuts in the arctic asking a question about networking anywhere except comp sys mac comm normally produces no useful responses posting the same question to comp sys mac comm ensures that your post is read and considered by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few network software designers please post to exactly one newsgroup do not cross post if a question isn t important enough for you to take the extra minute to figure out where it properly belongs it s not important enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading for the same reason comp sys mac misc should not be used as a catch all newsgroup the breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs where specifically questions about productivity applications software you bought your macintosh to run not software you bought to make your macintosh run better should go to comp sys mac apps unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup communications programs games hypercard compilers and databases all have more topical comp sys mac newsgroups post questions about non communications hardware including questions about what software is necessary to make particular hardware work to comp sys mac hardware questions about macos system software belong in comp sys mac system questions about utilities and extensions normally belong in comp sys mac misc questions about a ux go to comp unix aux detailed questions about appletalk belong in comp protocols appletalk direct questions about hypercard to comp sys mac hypercard non hypercard programming questions and questions about development environments should go to comp sys mac programmer resedit questions may be posted either to comp sys mac misc comp sys mac system or comp sys mac programmer but generally the netters who inhabit the darker recesses of comp sys mac programmer are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking a general exception to the above rules is that any very technical question about an application that actually begins to delve into the how s of a program as well as the what s recent example how does writenow which is written entirely in assembly compare to other word processors written in high level languages might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup for sale and want to buy posts should go to comp sys mac wanted and misc forsale computers mac only we understand that you re desperate to sell your upgraded k mac to get the for a powerbook but trust me anyone who wants to buy it will be reading comp sys mac wanted political and religious questions the mac is better than windows is not is too is not is too hey how bout the amiga what about it is not is too belong in comp sys mac advocacy anything not specifically mentioned above probably belongs in comp sys mac misc finally don t be so provincial as to consider only the comp sys mac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions many questions about modems in comp sys mac comm are much more thoroughly discussed in comp dcom modems questions about mac midi are often better handled in comp music even though it s not a macintosh specific newsgroup shop around usenet s a big place and not everything relevant to the macintosh happens in comp sys mac someone just asked why the system was taking up sixteen of their twenty megabytes of ram shouldn t i put my brilliance and wit on display for the world by posting the seventeenth response no frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as frequent questions unless you really have something new to add to the traditional answers such as the recent discovery that fonts in system could eat memory private e mail is a much better medium for answering common questions like this one you might want to add a mention of this faq in your e mail response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it before posting future questions i do read all the newsgroups covered here and have written a small script in microphone ii that lets me send pwfaq s people with frequently asked questions the section of this document that answers their question with just the click of a button so please don t feel obligated to respond to someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they can t be troubled to read the faq list to get it ftp where can i ftp mac software the three major north american internet archives of shareware freeware and demo software are sumex aim stanford edu mac archive umich edu and wuarchive wustl edu which mirrors the other two sites and several others wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove them for space concerns and still has files that were deleted from the formerly important site rascal ics utexas edu rascal was notable for storing its files in macbinary format rather than the less efficient binhex format common at the other archives unless otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document should be available at the above sites to keep traffic on the internet manageable scandinavians should try connecting to ftp funet fi ftp lth se or sics se instead those in the u k should look first at src doc ic ac uk continental europeans can try nic switch ch ezinfo ethz ch and anl anl fr australian users should try to find what they want at archie au which mirrors info mac and mac archive japanese users will find sumex mirrored at ftp u tokyo ac jp a fourth very important site is ftp apple com this is apple s semi official repository for system software developer tools source code technical notes and other things that come more or less straight from apple s mouth some material at this site may not be distributed outside the u s or by other sites that don t have an official license to distribute apple system software please read the various readme documents available at ftp apple com for the detailed info if you re connecting from outside the u s or if you wish to redistribute material you find here can i get shareware by e mail the info mac archives at sumex aim are available by e mail from listserv ricevm bitnet alternately listserv ricevm rice edu the listserver responds to the commands macarch help macarch index and macarch get filename mac archive files are available from mac mac archive umich edu send it a message containing the words help and index no quotes on the first two lines of your message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files you may request you can retrieve files from other sites by using the server at ftpmail decwrl dec com for details send it a message with just the text help no quotes where can i find application x if you can t find what you re looking for at one of the above sites try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it an e mail message addressed to archie with the subject help archie servers are located at archie rutgers edu america archie mcgill ca the original archie server in canada archie au australia archie funet fi scandinavia and archie doc ic ac uk the u k and the continent these sites index the tens of thousands of files available for anonymous ftp login as archie no password is needed and type prog filename to find what you re looking for or type help for more detailed instructions for instance you would type prog disinfectant to search for a convenient ftp site for disinfectant if the initial search fails to turn up the file you want try variations on and substrings of the name for instance if you didn t find disinfectant with prog disinfectant you might try prog disi instead substring searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross to avoid many erroneous matches add a hqx to the end of the substring e g prog disi hqx most mac software available on the net ends in hqx but almost no unix or pc software does please check the above archives and archie personally before asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware if you follow the above advice you should almost never have to ask the net where to find a particular piece of software can someone mail me application x no nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from comp binaries mac that was corrupt or missed at your site please refer to the first questions in this section to find out about anonymous ftp archie and automatic e mail servers what is bin hqx cpt etc most files available by ftp are modified twice to allow them to more easily pass through foreign computer systems first they re compressed to make them faster to download and then they re translated to either a binhex hqx or macbinary bin format that other computers can digest the macintosh uses a special two fork filing system that chokes most other computers binhex files are bit ascii text files while macbinary files are pure bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary protocol how a file has been translated and compressed for transmission is indicated by its suffix normally a file will have a name something like filename xxx yyy xxx indicates how it was compressed and yyy indicates how it was translated to use a file you ve ftp d and downloaded to your mac you ll need to reverse the process most files you get from the net require a two step decoding process first change the binhex hqx or macbinary bin file to a double clickable macintosh file then decompress it which programs decode which file types is covered in the table below also note that most macintosh telecommunications programs will automatically convert macbinary files to regular macintosh files as they are downloaded suffix sit cpt hqx bin pit z image dd zip uu tar extractors stuffit x x x x x compact pro x x packit x uutool x maccompress x suntar x x x x binhex x binhex x diskdoubler x x unzip x diskcopy x macutil x x x x a few notes on the decompressors stuffit is a family of products that use several different compression schemes the freeware stuffit expander will unstuff all of them versions of stuffit earlier than stuffit stuffit classic unstuffit and stuffit deluxe and will not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by stuffit you need to get a more recent version of stuffit or stuffit expander stuffit lite and deluxe consistently makes smaller archives than any other macintosh compression utility to allow maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep net bandwidth down please compress all files you send to anonymous ftp sites with stuffit uutool maccompress and suntar handle the popular unix formats of uuencode uu compress z and tar tar respectively the unix versions are often more robust than the mac products so use them instead when that s an option translators that allow stuffit lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also available by anonymous ftp macutil is dik winter s package of unix utilities to decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading them to a mac since unix stores files differently than does the mac macutil creates macbinary bin files which should be automatically converted on download it can t decompress everything in particular it can t decompress the new stuffit archives however if you need only one or two files out of an archive for instance if you want to read the readme to find out if a program does what you need it to do before you download all of it macutil is indispensable it can be found at sumex aim in the info mac unix directory a few notes on the compression formats bin these are macbinary files always use a binary file transfer protocol when transferring them never ascii or text most files on the net are stored as hqx instead only rascal stores most of its files in bin format most communications programs such as zterm and mackermit are capable of translating macbinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance they ll be downloading macbinary files image this format is normally used only for system software so that on line users can download files that can easily be converted into exact copies of the installer floppies instead of using diskcopy to restore the images to floppies you can use steve christensen s freeware utility mountimage to treat the images on your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive mountimage has a reputation for being buggy so you should have some blank floppies and a copy of diskcopy handy just in case sea x x sea files don t merit a position in the above table because they re self extracting they may have been created with compact pro stuffit or even diskdoubler but all should be capable of decompressing themselves when double clicked for some unknown reason alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard designation for self extracting archives created with their payware products superdisk and more disk space instead they append either x or x to self extracting archives how can i get binhex stuffit etc by far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human being to copy them onto a floppy for you if you re at a university there s absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to give you a copy and if you re anywhere less remote than mcmurdo sound chances are very good that someone at a computer center dealership or user group can provide you with a copy of stuffit once you have stuffit any version you don t need binhex if you re such a computer geek that the thought of actually asking a living breathing human being instead of a computer terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of protoplasmic jelly you can probably download a working copy of stuffit from a local bulletin board system if you have religious objections to software gotten by any means other than anonymous ftp then i suppose i ll mention that you can in fact ftp a working copy of stuffit though this is by far the hardest way to get it ftp to wuarchive wustl edu and login type the word binary hit return type cd mirrors rascal ics utexas edu compression and hit return then get stuffit expander sea bin and hit return of course it s always possible that by the time you read this stuffit expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this fails look for something similar if you ve ftp d straight onto your mac you should now have a self extracting archive which will produce a working copy of stuffit expander when double clicked if you ve ftp d to your mainframe or unix account first you still need to use a modem program to download it to your mac just make sure that the mac is receiving in macbinary mode and the mainframe is sending in binary mode if you need more details on the last step consult the faq list for comp sys mac comm and the manuals for both your mainframe and macintosh telecommunications software how can i get binhex stuffit etc from a pc you can t there is absolutely no way to get an executable macintosh file from an ftp site onto a pc and then onto your mac without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp you must beg borrow or steal the necessary software such as binhex or stuffit lite from another person i realize this may terrify those among you who haven t left your parents basement since you got an apple ii in but eventually you re going to need to link up with some human being other than your mother though i suppose if you re this much of a nerd you could send your mother out to get it for you while you re gathering your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world of daylight please don t bother the net by asking this question again there simply is no way to move executable macintosh programs from a pc or other non macintosh computer onto a mac without software that is not bundled with most macs troubleshooting what to do before posting when things go wrong while the various faq lists cover a lot of specific problems there are far more problems that aren t covered here these are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking for help you should probably also perform the ten step preventative maintenance routine described in section four especially rebuilding the desktop and resizing the system heap following these steps may or may not solve your problem but it will at least make it easier for others to recommend solutions to you identify the problem microsoft word is crashing doesn t say much what were you doing when it crashed can you repeat the actions that lead to the crash the more information you provide about the actions preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you the more precisely you ve identified the problem and the actions preceding it step the easier it will be to tell if the following steps fix the problem for example sometimes quarkxpress crashes with a coprocessor not installed error is not nearly as helpful as quarkxpress crashes when i link two text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already contain text the former will leave you wondering whether the bug remains after a given step the latter lets you go right to the problem and see if it s still there or not read the read me file many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and bugs in their read me files often these aren t documented in the manual read any read me files to see if any of the problems sound familiar check for viruses run disinfectant or another anti viral across your disk virus infections are rarer than most people think but they do occur and they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do reinstall the application and all its support files for half a dozen reasons external magnetic fields improperly written software the alignment of the planets a file on a disk may not contain the data it s supposed to contain this can cause all types of unexplained unusual behavior restoring from original masters will normally fix this reinstall the system software bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous see question for a detailed procedure for performing a clean reinstall if the problem continues to occur after you ve taken these steps chances are you ve found either a conflict between your application and some other software or a genuine bug in the program so it s time to isolate the problem you need to find the minimal system on which the problem will assert itself here are the basic steps of isolating the cause of a system or application crash a run only one application at a time occasionally applications do conflict with each other if the problem does not manifest itself without other applications running simultaneously you can begin launching other applications until you find the one that causes the crash b if you re running system turn off multifinder if you re running system allot as much memory to the application as you can afford sometimes programs just need more memory especially when performing complicated operations c if you re running system turn off virtual memory and bit addressing there s still an awful lot of system hostile software out there including some from companies that really have no excuse can you say microsoft word boys and girls i knew you could some of this software only expresses its incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken d boot from a virgin system floppy if the problem disappears you likely have an init conflict you need to progressively remove extensions until the problem vanishes use a little common sense when choosing the first extensions to remove if the problem occurs when you try to open a file remove any inits that mess with the standard file open procedure such as super boomerang first if the problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or if you have a lot of them perform a binary search by removing half of the extensions at a time once the problem disappears add half of the most recently removed set back continue until you ve narrowed the conflict down to one extension when you think you ve found the offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem contact technical support by now you should have a very good idea of when where and why the conflict occurs if a tech support number is available for the software call it if you re lucky the company will have a work around or fix available if not perhaps they ll at least add the bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release preventive maintenance you wouldn t drive your car miles without giving it a tune up a computer is no different regular tune ups avoid a lot of problems although there are mac mechanics who ll be happy to charge you or more for the equivalent of an oil change there s no reason you can t change it yourself the following nine step program should be performed about every three months trash unneeded files many of the operations that follow will run faster and more smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a little time cleaning up your hard disk if you re at all like me you ll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for applications you no longer have archives of software you ve dearchived shareware you tried out and didn t like announcements for events that have come and gone and many other files you no longer need if you re running system you may also have several more megabytes in your trash can alone throw them away and empty the trash rethink your extensions some macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain seriously consider whether you actually need every extension in your collection if you don t use the functionality of an extension at least every fifth time you boot up you re probably better off not storing it in your system folder where it only takes up memory destabilizes your system and slows down every startup for instance if you only read pc disks once a month there s no need to keep accesspc loaded all the time cutting back on your extension habit can really help avoid crashes rebuild the desktop the desktop file database holds all the information necessary to associate each file with the application that created it it lets the system know what application should be launched when you open a given file and what icons it should display where depending on its size each application has one or more representatives in the desktop file as applications and files move on and off your hard disk the desktop file can be become bloated and corrupt think of it as a congress for your mac every so often it s necessary to throw the bums out and start with a clean slate fortunately it s easier to rebuild the desktop than to defeat an incumbent one warning rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments you ve stored in the get info boxes under system maurice volaski s freeware init commentkeeper will retain those comments across a rebuild commentkeeper also works with system but only if apple s desktop manager extension is also installed to rebuild the desktop restart your mac and as your extensions finish loading depress the command and option keys you ll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild the desktop and warning you that this could take a few minutes click ok it will take more than a few minutes the more files you have the longer it will take if you re running system you may want to turn off multifinder before trying to rebuild the desktop if you re experiencing definite problems and not just doing preventive maintenance you may want to use fifth generation s freeware init desktop reset desktop reset completely deletes the desktop file before rebuilding it thus eliminating possibly corrupt data structures zap the pram and reset the clock all macs from the original k thin mac to the quadra contain a small amount of battery powered ram to hold certain settings that properly move with the cpu rather than with the disk such as which disk to boot from unfortunately this parameter ram can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes to reset it under system hold down the command option p and r keys while restarting your mac under system hold down the command option and shift keys while selecting the control panel from the apple menu click yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter ram since you ve erased almost all the settings in the general control panel you should now reset them to whatever you want the one setting that zapping the pram does not erase is the date and time but since the internal clock in the macintosh is notoriously inaccurate you ll probably want to take this opportunity to reset it anyway resize the system heap even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most people still have at least half a row of icons march across the bottom of their screen every time they restart all these extensions and most applications too need space in a section of memory called the system heap if the system heap isn t big enough to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of it they all start playing king of the mountain on the system heap knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and trying to climb back on after they get knocked off all this fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance and almost inevitably crashes the mac if you re using system your macintosh will automatically resize the system heap as necessary but if you re running system it s important to set your system heap size large enough to manage all your extensions and applications by default this size is set to k way too small for most macs with any extensions at all the system heap size is stored in the normally non editable boot blocks of every system disk bill steinberg s freeware utility bootman not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much needs to be allocated if you re running system get bootman use it and be amazed at how infrequently your macintosh crashes reinstall the system software system files can become corrupt and fragmented especially if you ve stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them merely updating the system software will often not fix system file corruption i recommend doing a clean reinstall here s how boot from the installer floppy of your system disks copy any non standard fonts and desk accessories out of your system file into a temporary suitcase trash the system file on your hard disk also trash the finder multifinder da handler and all other standard apple extensions like control panel and chooser these will all be replaced in the new installation if you re running or installing system move everything in the extensions control panels and preferences folders into the top level of the system folder rename the system folder any name other than system folder is fine double click the installer script on your system disk then choose customize select the appropriate software for your model mac and printer you could do an easy install instead but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you don t need that waste your memory and disk space once installation is finished move everything from the temporary folder you created in step into the new system folder if you re asked if you want to replace anything you forgot to take something out in step you ll need to replace things individually until you find the duplicate piece reinstall any fonts or da s you removed in step reboot you should now have a clean defragmented system file that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable system overall disk utilities much like system files hard disks have data structures that occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even causing data loss apple includes disk first aid a simple utility for detecting and repairing hard disk problems with its system disks it s also available for anonymous ftp from ftp apple com in the directory dts mac sys soft hdsc even if you have an earlier version you should get the latest version from ftp apple com and run it on all your hard disks several companies have released payware disk utilities that detect and repair considerably more problems than disk first aid though interestingly none of them detect and repair everything that disk first aid does the three most effective for general work are central point s mactools deluxe fifth generation s public utilites and symantec s norton utilities for the macintosh a department or work group should have all of these as well as disk first aid since none of them fix everything the others do for individuals mactools street is about half the price of norton street or public utilities street so features and ease of use being roughly equal i recommend mactools all of these products occasionally encounter problems they can t fix when that happens it s time to backup and reformat backing up this is one part of preventative maintenance that should be done a lot more often than every three months the simplest back up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies or other removable media if you keep your data files separate from your application and support files then it s easy to only back up those folders which change frequently nonetheless every three months you should do a complete backup of your hard disk a number of programs are available to make backing up easier apple included a very basic full backup application with system with the performas apple ships a new apple backup utility that can backup the entire disk or just the system folder onto floppies the previously mentioned norton utilities for the mac and mactools deluxe include more powerful floppy backup utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups finally if you re lucky enough to have a tape drive network server or removable media device to use for backups you should check out the more powerful payware utilities redux street doesn t support tape drives and diskfit pro street there are no freely available backup utilities other than the old hd backup from system disk defragmentation as disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free space in the same place to write large files therefore the operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be stored in different places on your hard disk as files become more and more fragmented performance can degrade there are several ways to defragment a hard disk the most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your files erase the hard disk and you might as well reformat while you re at it see question and restore all the files a number of payware utilities including norton utilities for the mac and mac tools deluxe can defragment a disk in place i e without erasing it although the ads for all these products brag about their safety once you ve bought the software and opened the shrink wrap they all warn you to back up your disk before defragmenting it in case something does go wrong there are no freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please don t annoy the net by asking for one reformat your hard disk just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use so a hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data you don t need to reformat every three months but when your system is crashing no matter what you try reformatting is the ultimate means of wiping the slate clean reformatting your hard disk may even gain you a few extra megabytes of space not all hard disks are created equal some can hold more data than others to facilitate mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks megabytes is the average formatted capacity your mileage may vary apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator of drive capacity when you reformat there s no reason at all not to reclaim whatever unused space apple s left on your disk unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to initialize them most hard disks come with formatting software apple s disks and system software ship with hd sc setup a minimal disk formatter which will format apple brand hard drives only most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with their hard drives normally this will be all you need to reformat your hard disk a number of general purpose formatters are also available which go beyond the bundled software to include features like encryption password protection multiple partitioning faster disk access system compatibility and even compression two of the best are the payware drive and hard disk toolkit personal edition street for either while there are one or two freeware formatters available none are likely to be superior to the ones bundled with your hard disk powerbook users should be sure to turn off sleep and processor cycling before reformatting their hard drives no matter what software they use otherwise disk corruption crashes and data losses are a very good possibility elliotte rusty harold department of mathematics elharo shiva njit edu new jersey institute of technology erh tesla njit edu newark nj

monitor jitter several weeks ago i described a problem with my apple high resolution monitor and promised to summarize replies received by e mail to recapitulate occasionally every two or three hours or so my monitor momentarily loses sync the entire raster image bounces down about an eighth of an inch or so then rights itself this usually happens right after i close a large window highlight a large area or do something that radically alters the image on the screen sometimes though it happens with no provocation whatsoever i have received a bewildering range of replies at one extreme was a man clearly quite knowledgable about monitors who said that the problem was that the monitor s power supply simply couldn t always keep up with sudden changes of the raster image the rapid change from a largely light screen to a largely dark one overtaxed the monitor s power supply there was no fix available he said because nothing was really wrong i guess he meant that the flaw was so fundamental that it had to be endured this seemed quite persuasive and i would have been tempted to adopt an attitude of stoicism except for a reply from a monitor owner who discovered that this very problem is documented in the apple service technical procedures volume under the heading jitter correction the section describes a fix involving the replacement of a capacitor the adjustment of a potentiometer or failing that the swap of a circuit board i would be grateful for a discussion among those who have had experience with this sort of thing

x x how do they compare also amiga comparisson david a schnider bmug org wrote the real question here in my opinion is what motorola processors running sy stem on a mac are comparable to what intel processors running windows on a pc i stuff deleted david even better than that how does a based amiga perform in daily tasks compared to my based iici answer except in a very few cases i get my butt kicked by the amiga sure there are other considerations but it goes to show you how proper design from the beginning in hardware and software can give you great returns as well as showing you that if you don t have a marketing department to speak of no one will care how good your system is i ve had the same experience actually i love the mac interface and any number of the features but am sorely dissapointed with the speed i use macs daily and am a moc consultant for osu statistics department i m familiar with almost every model out there and my experience is that both the amiga and the atari st simply blow the mac out of the water in terms of performance at this time i would in general say that the other advantages of the mac outweigh the advantages of the amiga or the st and falcon but i really wish apple would get their heads together on speed they could take a real lesson in muli tasking from the amiga os or the multitos in the atari falcons too i m still happy with my ci but i don t understand why the performance is so bad comparatively they could have done multi tasking properly they could have done everthing else better but apple didn t of course dos and windows are nothin to write home about either i just hope that someone comes out with a machine that does everything well someday if i had my choice i would go with mac in most aspects but add the speed and superior multi tasking of the other platforms as for the original topic trying to compare just the chip in a machine seems almost worthless a fast with a wiz bang graphics accelerator will be faster in productivity for many applications than a even a stock quadra add a graphics accelerator to a and you really fly of course add one the the quadra and then you re blowing the away etc oh well y all got worth for the price of i think mine was only worth david butler dhbutler magnus acs ohio state edu this is not a novel to be tossed away lightly it should be thrown with great force dorothy parker

mac ii vi to be discontinued good buy a local dealer is offering mac ii vi machines equipped with kodak multi session compatible cd rom drives for what seems like an attractive price i ve used many other models up to a ii ci but this would be the first i could have my own mac is it safe to buy an about to be discontinued model such as this i d like to yank the cd rom drive out put it in a housing and share it with my pc is this feasible the only info i have on the ii vi is that it is relatively slow mhz has an chip with a math coprocessor i want to add a non apple portrait monitor and use this machine for hypercard stack design is this a good buy or would i be wasting my money i would appreciate some advice thanks robert matthews grfg twnmoe bitnet edu tw taiwan
re the mhz iisi re methods for attaching heat sink to processor go to radio shack and buy a tube of heat sink compound it comes in a little blue and white tube with a black screw on cap at radio shack it s catalog number it s a mix of silicone and zinc oxide and conducts heat very well plus it s tacky usually you would smear a bit between the chip and the sink and then bolt or clamp the sink down but if you don t move your mac gravity and the stickiness of the goo should be more than suffcient to hold things in place just make sure you remember it s in there in case you tilt your mac and jar it hard enough to shake it loose you wouldn t want a loose piece of metal running around inside your mac

re stereo sound problem on mac games in article ingemar isy ingemar ragnemalm ingemar isy liu se writes enter game developers the sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games the sound driver is pretty ok since it s fast sound manager used by the book is useless disposing of sound channels as soon as sound has completed is out of the question for games with smooth animation it s too slow why would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more sounds soon if you are trying to write a game you shouldn t be using sndplay instead make a channel and use buffercmds to play sounds on it it works great you can add callbacks to the channel also to let you know when the channel is getting empty before it gets empty the sound driver is so much snappier than sound manager unfortunately system supports it poorly making programs crash occasionally the moral of the story is to developers don t cheat well i want my code to work on old systems too i don t know about sys but at least on there are bugs in the sound manager that causes channels to hang with no error message this happends when i keep a channel open for long periods necessary for performance and play many sounds stopping sounds halfway callbacks seems not to be reliable then only way i can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to inspect private variables in the channel qhead i think it was and the only way i have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an undocumented flag and modify it callbacks are very reliable i found them reliable even under system i was doing continuous background sound with interrupting sound effects on system with the im v documentation you probably were cancelling your callback commands out of your channels of course you didn t get called in general if you have problems with sounds working when you play one per channel and then close the channel with the related slowdown but then when you play more than one you don t work then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a channel possibly the same one multiple times this might be because you are calling sndplay on a preexisting channel with a sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to the channel first thing before it plays most sampled sounds have this command at the start of them you need to resedit the sound and remove that command then when you create your channel specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the channel s synth then you can use asynch sndplay s all you want you ll probably want to switch to buffercmd s since you are going to have to use snddocommand anyway to add callbacks now before you go ahead and tell me i am full of it and the sound manager doesn t work for games remember spectre uses it and it works great if spectre can spare the cpu time you can too one little disclaimer there are some out there who say the sound manager in the iisi can t be made to work right i m not sure either way but i know for sure that you can make your sounds work correctly on every other machine using the sound manager steve

quadra clock modification long here is how i modified my quadra for higher speed previously i had been using a variable speed overdrive for accelerating my cpu but this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds your mileage may vary the top speed you achieve cannot be predicted before hand my personal q has tested fine up to mhz thus far i didn t have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher speeds parts clock oscillators pin ttl variety you will need a selection of speeds beginning at mhz on up the cpu will run at the oscillator speed the original one is a mhz unit i recommend getting a mhz clock in case you damage the existing one i obtained my clock oscillators from digikey for less than each some of their part numbers are mhz ttl clock oscillator part x mhz ttl clock oscillator part x mhz ttl clock oscillator part ctx don t get the half size clock oscillators they won t fit there are also cmos clock oscillators i haven t tried one in a quadra they work fine in iisi s socket obtain a pin socket which is in the same form factor as a pin dip package alternatively use machined socket pins from an augat style socket just cut them out of the socket cooling fan a very small volt fan to keep the cpu cool is a must my vso came with a specially modified heatsink which had a fan built onto it it had a pass through connector which tapped into the hard drive power cable you should rig up something similar or risk frying your cpu procedure insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here remove the top lid of the machine you will see the floppy disk and hard drive mounted in a plastic tower follow the usual anti static precautions and of course make sure the machine is off when you do this unplug all cables wall and monitor power supply cords from the back of the mac remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up the tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply you may also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power supply leave that alone the plastic tab from the tower is all you need release look at the rear of the tower assembly you will see the flat ribbon scsi connector to the hard drive a power cable and a flat ribbon cable leading to the floppy drive disconnect all these from the motherboard the hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed to release it unplug the drive activity led from its clear plastic mount look down the posterior cylindrical section of the plastic tower a phillips head screw is at the base remove it taking care not to drop it into the case a bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful here remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the right side of the tower this tab prevents the tower from sliding posteriorly slide the entire tower assembly cm posteriorly then lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case remove the interrupt switch assembly it is a strangely shaped plastic device at the left front edge of the motherboard pull the middle rear plastic prong up and forward the entire device will release unplug the speaker cable squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case remove the motherboard form the case lift the front right corner of the motherboard about mm this allows it to clear the clear plastic power light guide slide the motherboard forward about cm the motherboard then comes directly out locate the mhz clock crystal it is a small metal box near the cpu chip note and remember its orientation the new clock oscillators must be aligned with pin in the same orientation very carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator some of the pins may be bent over simply desolder then unbend them be sure your desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board i used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task this is not appropriate for a first soldering experience the motherboard is a multi layer design with very fine traces easily damaged without proper care install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was put a mhz clock oscillator into the new socket you could use the old clock but it has solder on its pins this may come of inside the socket and cause corrosion problems later i suggest using a new mhz clock install your cooling fan system to complete the modification reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother board firmly plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about cm posterior of its intended position lower the tower assembly into place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case once fully down slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks into place reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables dont t forget the floppy drive cable replace the phillips head screw drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount reattach your cables and power cords cross your fingers and turn on the mac it should make the usual power on chord if it doesn t something is amiss immediately turn of the power and recheck your handiwork if all is not well you have my sincere condolences hopefully all will work normally turn the machine back off and replace the mhz clock oscillator with a faster one reboot and be astounded you will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding a particular speed is truly usable with my vso a machine lock up might take hours of operation to occur in the brief time since modifying my clock oscillator hours i have not had a single problem good luck to all who attempt this modification there is a small but real risk but you could well reach quadra speeds or higher with less than in parts guy kuo

re monitors should they be kept on hours a day stubbs hawk cs ukans edu jerry stubbs writes the electricy consumption will go down if you turn them off overnight along with heat i wonder how hard it would be i e what it would add to the cost to design desktop machines with a power saver feature built in which would reduce power consumption automatically if the machine is idle for more than some amount of time this is pretty standard in portable machines and the same kinds of tricks could be played spinning down disks turning off screens reducing clock speed etc the advantage of this over just turning the thing off would be you don t have to remember to do anything and the machine is still available over the network the tricky part might be in defining what constitutes inactivity certainly you don t want to wake up from sleep mode just because somebody pinged you but you do want to wake up at least the cpu if somebody logs in via a telnet connection i wouldn t worry too much about wasting electricity in the winter months that energy is just getting turned into heat it may not be as efficient a way to heat a building as the central heating plant but it s not too bad in the summer though it s a disaster not only are you wasting that power but you re probably also running the air conditioning to get rid of the waste heat roy smith roy nyu edu hippocrates project department of microbiology coles nyu school of medicine first avenue new york ny this never happened to bart simpson

re monitors should they be kept on hours a day i wonder how hard it would be i e what it would add to the cost to design desktop machines with a power saver feature built in which would reduce power consumption automatically if the machine is idle for more than some amount of time i believe that apple sun and a number of other desktop machine manufacturers have agreed with the government to incorporate power saving techniques this is also something that governments in other countries are likely to require in the future so expect to see it this may include the ability for the system to fully power down the monitor via a controllable power outlet and power it back on automatically is this a sell on screen saver software companies goals for idle power consumption have been set at something like watts for the system not including the monitor don t quote me on this note that in many businesses the savings will be substantial especially if you factor in reduced load on air conditioning systems sun did a study that indicated that simply powering off monitors for the night would save the company sun itself on the order of m per year putting other and automatic power saving features in would probably have greater than double that value given that we are seeing more and more reason to leave our work and home computers on getting faxes automatically getting email building power consumption control into all machines has a potential to cut off the national power consumption based on data i heard btw when encouraging employees to power off monitors when leaving work it was pointed out that this should only be done with monitors with the power switch on front there was some indication that monitors with power switches on the rear are not designed to tolerate lots of power cycling this may only apply to the monitors we use but might be worth checking if you happen to have a monitor with the switch in back

quadra marginal video we are having a problem with a quadra that has stumped a couple of techs sent to us by the vendor as well as us this quadra is stuffed with mb ram mb vram and some large disk mb i think what happens is that after a certain variable interval of time the video circuitry loses vertical sync it is quite apparent that the mac cpu is still ok and the problem really seems to lie with the video circuitry since you can still save your documents quit your aplpications even pull down menus etc only the display is scrolling lik crazy so it s pretty hard to hit menu items we had the original logic board replaced twice now and the same problem has been occurring on all boards although the inteval between occurrences has varied the first board had this problem every about hr more often if the cache was turned off yes off this is the only symptom that is not obviously related to the video circuitry after all the cache is on the cpu right the second board had the problem every about minutes we did not keep it rather we put the original back the current board we have has this problem a lot less often has gone about a week without doing it but did it twice within an hour yesterday the technicians that have come out to try to figure it out seemed pretty sharp and tried a number of sensible things most of which we had previously tried ourselves anyway these included swapping the ram swapping the vram swapping monitors different apple rgb and apple rgb swapping cables disconnecting hd and booting from floppy sacrificing various small mammals here are some other facts when we put a rasterops procolor on the nubus the problem is fixed it does not occur with the internal video or the procolor video out the vendor cannot reproduce the problem back in their shop on the boards that exhibit it in our lab apple is said to be getting a little bit pissed off at shipping us boards that they cannot find anything wrong with and getting them shipped back as faulty according to us here are some speculations i bet that neither apple nor the vendor has tested these boards with that much ram and vram on them simultaneaously which may have something to do with their finding it hard to reproduce the problem though we can reproduce it with just mb of ram so this is probably a red herring the vendor s representative blames metal in your walls claims that our walls have metal in them which interferes with the mac s operation we have another in the lab which works like a charm though it s not in the exact same spot please don t tell me this is probably it i do not want to believe it it s probably not poltergeists since they do not have badges to get past security at the entrance to our site has anyone any ideas please please email as well as posting cause i seem to be spending a lot of time rebooting my mac lately and have a lot less time available to read news thank you in advance carlo tiana nasa ames research center carlo vision arc nasa gov carlo cvs rochester edu carlo white stanford edu we always remember you have a choice carlo vision arc nasa gov

re monitors should they be kept on hours a day gary sager gsager heliacal eng sun com wrote btw when encouraging employees to power off monitors when leaving work it was pointed out that this should only be done with monitors with the power switch on front there was some indication that monitors with power switches on the rear are not designed to tolerate lots of power cycling this may only apply to the monitors we use but might be worth checking if you happen to have a monitor with the switch in back i m not an expert but having spent much too much of my life looking for the power switch or the brightness control or the de gauss etc etc etc it is my firm belief that the only reason any controls switches knobs whatever in places where they are hard to reach is because the designers put them there deliberately the real question is weather this is because of stupidity or maliciousness charles herbig unable to locate coffee operator halted masc ucssun sdsu edu

re why the drive speeds differ in article apr mcontent apana org au thomas n a krebs mcontent apana org au writes the most likely explanation may have something to do with the fact that a greater density of information exists on the larger capacity disk drive than the smaller one if your running the drive on a mac i would recommend a shareware utility called timedrive which tests seek scsi throughput and rotational speed this utility should let you know what the differences are between the drives the views expressed in this posting those of the individual author only bbs number maccontent is victoriaus first iconic bbs larger drives tend to have multipule platters which can allow adjacent bits to be read in parallel resulting in higher throughput they also have higher spindle speeds which leads to both increased throughput and reduced seek times due to reduction of rotational latency erik speckman

flaky large memory simms on s in the last two weeks i have the following problem on two s has a mb simm and the other a mb simm both are about months old bought from different vendors and installed by different people both computers begin crashing frequently locking up and ultimately the memory chimes crashes would almost always occur if you moved the screen and sometimes would occur when you weren t even touching the computer in both cases taking the machine apart taking the memory out and putting it back in solved the problem for awhile but then it would comeback my marginally educated guess as to what s happening is that larger simms are lopsided in that the insertion point is sort of a pivot point and after time they begin to move about possible because of pressure on the keyboard or something anyway has anyone else had such a problem or solution if somehow you could support the other end of the simm to prevent it from moving i ve had no problem for the past weeks by replacing my mb simm with a mbsimm although this is not desireble solution please email any resp and or post if usefull to the rest of the world ted ted schreiber mechanical enginering northwestern university tel fax email rts nwu edu

re good aps experience i thought i d share a good experience too i bought the aps quantum zero footprint drive in may back when they still used two separate leds on the front panel and the case was metal while traveling with it it was in my se mac bag on top of the mac this past winter one of the plastic tabs holding the front panel on broke so that the right side of the front panel was coming forward away from the rest of the drive i lived with this situation until it became completely intolerable which more or less coincided with a network shutdown at school and a trip out of town i had to take which gave me some dead time during which to have the drive sent out i called aps for an rma and got one with no questions asked about how the tab got broken it was handled a little roughly by airline baggage handlers though nothing else was damaged well except for the internal speaker in my modem which wasn t that well glued down to begin with yeah yeah i m never flying with my se again and when i called back to ask whether i could send it in a little later rather than right away they had no problem with that even when i exceeded the normal valid period for an rma by a day they re usually good for days the front panel was replaced under warranty and the drive was shipped back quickly i mailed it first class insured on a saturday by noon from l a to missouri and it came back by fed ex by friday i don t know exactly what day it came back because i was traveling that week from wednesday afternoon to sunday afternoon the only thing that could ve been bad was that the first service rep i talked to in an attempt to prevent jeopardizing my data suggested that i take the drive mechanism out and send just the case unfortunately i discovered the day i was mailing the thing that would necessitate breaking the little seal and thus voiding the warranty oh well al albert seas ucla edu
re help how to test simms well you can always try and find a pc dealer who sells guaranteed memory i work at a company growing at a year we have on order hundreds of computers per year it never fails machines come in with bad simms now for those of you who are wondering just why your pc or mac just crashed i can tell you i always thought it was the incompetent ass who wrote or designed the software well i don t think that way anymore especially with the results i have gotten with replacing bad simms in my own machine and others at work the moral to this story is to make sure your memory is good i would be willing to bet lots of you out there have simms with either soft or hard errors on them and you don t even know about it but every once in awhile those bad simms just makes your life hell i just got plain sick of dealing with peoples complaints that thier machine just crashed and they lost thier work in case your wondering or if you haven t already guessed i work in an is department service is a do or die perogative in this line of work so the moral is have your memory tested with a simm hardware tester and no i don t mean the simple little software programs that you can run in your machine simms are complicated little beasts and they needs special hardware to test them effectively if any of you are interested in getting one of these nifty little devices which are not cheap write me back they make life a little bit easier and besides they pay for themselves in a short time from the loss of productivity people would have to deal with when thier machine commits suicide greg carter
