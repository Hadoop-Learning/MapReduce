re a visit from the jehovah s witnesses in article apr batman bmd trw com jbrown batman bmd trw com writes didn t you say lucifer was created with a perfect nature yes define perfect then i think you are playing the usual game here make sweeping statements like omni holy or perfect and don t note that they mean exactly what they say and that says that you must not use this terms when it leads to contradictions i m not trying to play games here but i understand how it might seem that way especially when one is coming from a completely different point of view such as atheism take your foot out of your mouth i wondered about that already when i was a catholic christian the fact that the contradiction is unresolvable is one of the reasons why i am an atheist believe me i believed similar sentences for a long time but that shows the power of religion and not anything about its claims now god could have prevented lucifer s fall by taking away his ability to choose between moral alternatives worship god or worship himself but that would mean that god was in error to have make lucifer or any being with free will in the first place exactly god allows evil an evil if there ever was one now that s an opinion or at best a premise but from my point of view it is not a premise which is necessary true specifically that it is an evil to allow evil to occur it follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used letting evil happen or allowing evil to take place in this place even causing evil is another evil but could you give a definition of free will especially in the presence of an omniscient being will is self determination in other words god created conscious beings who have the ability to choose between moral choices independently of god all will therefore is free will the omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do even before the omnipotent has created them there is no choice left all is known the course of events is fixed not even for the omniscient itself to extend an argument by james tims if god is omniscient then clearly creating beings with free moral choice is a greater good than the emergence of ungodliness evil sin since he created them knowing the outcome in advance why is it the greater good to allow evil with the knowledge that it will happen why not make a unipolar system with the possibility of doing good or not doing good but that does not necessarily imply doing evil it is logically possible but your god has not done it i do not know that such is logically possible if god restrains a free being s choice to choose to do evil and simply do not good then can it be said that the being truly has a free moral choice and if good is defined as loving and obeying god and avoiding those behaviors which god prohibits then how can you say that one who is not good is not evil as well like i said i am not sure that doing not good without doing evil is logically possible and when i am not omnipotent how can i have free will you have said something about choices and the scenario gives them therefore we have what you define as free will imagine the following i can do good to other beings but i cannot harm them easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good deeds but don t make them long for them so they can not feel the absence of good as evil but whose case am i arguing it is conceivable so the omnipotent can do it or it would not be omnipotent if you want logically consistent as well you have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first deletion perhaps it is weak in a way if i were just speculating about the ubiquitous pink unicorns then there would be no basis for such speculation but this idea of god didn t just fall on me out of the blue or while reading science fiction or fantasy i know that some will disagree the bible describes a god who is omniscient and nevertheless created beings with free moral choice from which the definitional logic follows but that s not all there is to it there seems to be at least in my mind a certain amount of evidence which indicates that god exists and that the biblical description of him may be a fair one it is that evidence which bolsters the argument in my view that the bible describes an omniscient and omnipotent god destroys the credibility of the bible nothing less and a lot of people would be interested in evidence for a god unfortunately there can t be any with these definitions benedikt

re an anecdote about islam in article bu edu jaeger buphy bu edu gregg jaeger writes when they are victimized they are muslims when they victimize others they are not true muslims tm or no muslims at all quite annoying i don t understand the point of this petty sarcasm it is a basic principle of islam that if one is born muslim or one says i testify that there is no god but god and mohammad is a prophet of god that so long as one does not explicitly reject islam by word then one must be considered muslim by all muslims so the phenomenon you re attempting to make into a general rule or psychology is a direct odds with basic islamic principles if you want to attack islam you could do better than than to argue against something that islam explicitly contradicts it was no criticism of islam for a change it was a criticism of the arguments used namely whenever people you identify as muslims are the victims of the attacks of others they are used an argument for the bad situation of muslims but whenever deeds by muslim that victimize others are named they do not count as an argument because what these people did was not done as a true muslims no mention is made how muslims are the cause of a bad situation of another party double standards benedikt
re political atheists reference line trimmed livesey solntze wpd sgi com jon livesey writes there is a good deal more confusion here you started off with the assertion that there was some objective morality and as you admit here you finished up with a recursive definition murder is objectively immoral but eactly what is murder and what is not itself requires an appeal to morality yes now you have switch targets a little but only a little now you are asking what is the goal what do you mean by goal are you suggesting that there is some objective goal out there somewhere and we form our morals to achieve it well for example the goal of natural morality is the survival and propogation of the species another example of a moral system is presented within the declaration of independence which states that we should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness you see to have a moral system we must define the purpose of the system that is we shall be moral unto what end murder is certainly a violation of the golden rule and i thought i had defined murder as an intentional killing of a non murderer against his will and you responded to this by asking whether or not the execution of an innocent person under our system of capital punishment was a murder or not i fail to see what this has to do with anything i never claimed that our system of morality was an objective one i thought that was your very first claim that there was some kind of objective morality and that an example of that was that murder is wrong if you don t want to claim that any more that s fine well murder violates the golen rule which is certainly a pillar of most every moral system however i am not assuming that our current system and the manner of its implementation are objectively moral i think that it is a very good approximation but we can t be perfect and by the way you don t seem to understand the difference between arbitrary and objective if keith schneider defines murder to be this that and the other that s arbitrary jon livesey may still say well according to my personal system of morality all killing of humans against their will is murder and wrong and what the legal definition of murder may be in the usa kuweit saudi arabia or the prc may be matters not a whit to me well objective would assume a system based on clear and fundamental concepts while arbitary implies no clear line of reasoning keith

re political atheists bobbe vice ico tek com robert beauchaine writes but you don t know that capital punishment is wrong so it isn t the same as shooting a better analogy would be that you continue to drive your car realizing that sooner or later someone is going to be killed in an automobile accident you know people get killed as a result of driving yet you continue to do it anyway uh uh you do not know that you will be the one to do the killing i m not sure i d drive a car if i had sufficient evidence to conclude that i would necessarily kill someone during my lifetime yes and everyone thinks as you do no one thinks that he is going to cause or be involved in a fatal accident but the likelihood is surprisingly high just because you are the man on the firing squad whose gun is shooting blanks does not mean that you are less guilty i don t know about jon but i say all taking of human life is murder and i say murder is wrong in all but one situation when it is the only action that will prevent another murder either of myself or another you mean that killing is wrong in all but one situtation and you should note that that situation will never occur there are always other options thank killing why don t you just say that all killing is wrong this is basically what you are saying i m getting a bit tired of your probabilistic arguments are you attempting to be condescending that the system usually works pretty well is small consolation to the poor innocent bastard getting the lethal injection is your personal value of human life based solely on a statistical approach you sound like an unswerving adherent to the needs of the many outweighing the needs of the few so fuck the few but most people have found the risk to be acceptable you are probably much more likely to die in a plane crash or even using an electric blender than you are to be executed as an innocent i personally think that the risk is acceptable but in an ideal moral system no such risk is acceptable acceptable is the fudge factor necessary in such an approximation to the ideal keith

re political atheists bobbe vice ico tek com robert beauchaine writes if i kill this person an innocent person convicted of murder then a murder would be committed but i would not be the murderer at least i wouldn t reasonably be considered a murderer with reasonable being introduced as a fudge factor necessary to account for the inability to be totally objective due to a lack of absolutely true information if society collective decides to carry the burden of executing it s citizens then it also carries the blame for their innocent blood each and every voter who casts a ballot in favor of capital punishment is in part guilty of the murder of each and every innocent victim of the system why are only those people in favor of the system to blame if society accepts such a system then each member of society is to blame when an innocent person gets executed those that are not in favor should work to convince others and most members of our society have accepted the blame they ve considered the risk to be acceptable similarly every person who drives must accept the blame for fatal traffic accidents this is something that is surely going to happen when so many people are driving it is all a question of what risk is acceptable it is much more likely that an innocent person will be killed driving than it is that one will be executed keith

re political atheists livesey solntze wpd sgi com jon livesey writes much though it might be fun to debate capital punishment itself this is probably the wrong group for it the only relevance here is that you don t seem to be able to tell us what capital punishment actually is and when it is murder that is when you tell us murder is wrong you are using a term you have not yet defined well i ve said that when an innocent person has been executed this is objectively a murder however who is at blame is another question it seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions realizing the risks is to blame there is a probability of killing an innocent person by shooting at random into the air and there is a probability of killing an innocent person when the state administers a system of capital punishment so when you do either you know that they actions you are taking will sooner or later result in the killing of an innocent person yes but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom activity presumably you had not isolated yourself totally from the rest of society because of this and driving will kill people as will airlines but people continue to do both driving and flying are not punishments inflicted on unwilling prisoners by courts they are risks that we take upon ourselves willingly and i argue that our law system is a similar risk perhaps an innocent person will be punished someday but we work to prevent this in fact many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment of innocents if our own driving kills someone else then sure there is a moral issue i know at least one person who was involved in a fatal accident and they felt vey guilty afterwards but such accidents are to be totally expected given the numner of vehicals on the road again the blame is on society no i m not this is what you said you were saying that if there were such a false witness that resulted in an innocent person being convicted and killed it would still be the fault of the state since it did the actual killing no i just commented that the state does the killing it does not depend on there being false witnesses how could it the state does the killing even in the case of sincere mistakes yes but the state is not at fault in such a case the state can only do so much to prevent false witnesses it is possible so what are you trying to say that capital punishment is always murder because of the possibilty of human error invalidating the system i m saying capital punishment is murder period not because of this that and the other but because it involves taking human life that s my definition of murder i make no appeals to dictionaries or to objective morals okay so this is what you call murder but the question is whether or not all such murders are wrong are you saying that all taking of human life is wrong no matter what the circumstances if we as a society decide to murder someone then we should say that and lists our reasons for doing so and live with the moral consequences we should not play word games and pretend that murder isn t murder and that s my opinion about how society ought to be run but this is basically how it works society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution and every member of society shares this blame and most people s definitions of murder include some sort of malicious intent which is not involved in an execution is it but we were trying to discuss an objective moral system or at least its possibilty what ramifications does your personal system have on an objective one no we were not discussing an objective moral system i was showing you that you didn t have one because for one thing you were incapable of defining the terms in it for example murder murder violates the golden rule executions do not because by allowing it at all society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the innocent victim is we re not talking about reading minds we are just talking about knowing the truth yes we can never be absolutely certain that we have the truth but the court systems work on a principle of knowing the truth beyond a reasonable doubt sorry but you simply are not quoting yourself accurately here is what you said and since we are looking totally objectively at this case then we know what people are thinking when they are voting to execute the person or not if the intent is malicious and unfair then the execution would be murder what you are doing now is to slide into another claim which is quite different the jury being persuaded beyond a serious doubt is not the same as us knowing what is in their minds beyond a serious doubt reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not but in an objective system only the absolute truth matters and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth that is twelve members must be convinced of a truth moreover a jury which comes from a sufficiently prejudiced background may allow itself to be persuaded beyond a serious doubt on evidence that you and i would laugh at but then if we read the minds of these people we would know that the conviction was unfair but would it be perfectly fair if we could read minds if we assume that it would be fair if we knew the absolute truth why is it so much less fair in your opinion if we only have a good approximation of the absolute truth it s not a question of fairness your claim which i have quoted above is a claim about whether we can know it was fair so as to be able to distinguish capital punishnment from murder yes while we could objectively determine the difference if we knew all possible information we can t always determine the difference in our flawed system i think that our system is almost as good as possible but it still isn t objectively perfect you see it doesn t matter if we know it is fair or not objectively it is either fair or it is not now there s a huge difference if we can read minds we can know and if we cannot read minds we can know nothing the difference is not in degree of fairness but in what we can know but what we know has no effect on an objective system i think it is possible to produce a fairly objective system if we are clear on which goals it is supposed to promote i m not going to waste my time trying to devise a system that i am pretty sure does not exist why are you so sure i simply want people to confront reality my reality remember why is your reality important in this case the reality is that ideal theories apart we can never know even after the fact about the fairness of the justice system for every innocent person released from death row there may have been a dozen innocent people executed or a hundred or none at all we simply don t know but we can assume that the system is fairly decent at least most likely and you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a totally ideal and objective system now what are we going to do on the one hand we can pretend that we have an ideal theory and that we can know things we can never know and the justie system is fair and that we can wave a magic wand and make certain types of killing not murder and go on our way well we can have an ideal system but the working system can not be ideal we can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to the ideal system as possible on the other hand we can recognize that all justice has a small we hope probability of punishing the innocent and that in the end we do bear moral responsibility even for the probabilistic consequences of the systems we set up and then say well here we go murdering again maybe some of us will even say gee i wonder if all this is strictly necessary yes we all bear the responsibility most people seem willing to do this i think that the second is preferable in that if requires people to face the moral consequences of what we do as a society instead of sheltering ourselves from them by magic ceremonies and word games we must realize the consequences of all our actions why do you keep separating the justice system from the pack and lest i forget i also don t think we have an objective moral system and i believe i only have to take that idea seriously when someone presents evidence of it i don t think our country has an objective system but i think such an objective system can exist in theory without omniscience an objective system is not possible in practice keith

idle questions for fellow atheists i wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of the world if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group of the population it is rather a ridiculous question in some ways i know but my newsreader is down so i am not getting any new postings for a bit so i figure i might as well post something new myself also how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking the typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the same inherent motivation so one is not intrinsically different from the other qualitatively but then again a measuring stick must be drawn somewhere and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery ie how it expresses its own selfishness idle thoughts adam adam john cooper verily often have i laughed at the weaklings who thought themselves good simply because acooper macalstr edu they had no claws

re political atheists reference line trimmed ssauyet eagle wesleyan edu scott d sauyet writes first i ll make the assumption that you agree that a murderer is one who has commited murder well i d say that a murderer is one who intentionally committed a murder for instance if you put a bullet into a gun that was thought to contain blanks and someone was killed with such a gun the person who actually performed the action isn t the murderer but i guess this is actually made clear in the below definition i d be interested to see a more reasonable definition what do you mean by reasonable otherwise your inductive definition doesn t bottom out your definition in essence is that murder is the intentional killing of someone who has not commited murder against his will expanding the second occurence of murder in the above we see that yes it is bad to include the word being defined in the definition but even though the series is recursively infinite i think the meaning can still be deduced i assume you can see the problem here to do a correct inductive definition you must define something in terms of a simpler case and you must have one or several bottoming out cases for instance we can define the factorial function the function which assigns to a positive integer the product of the positive integers less than or equal to it on the positive integers inductively as follows math lesson deleted okay let s look at this situation suppose there is a longstanding feud between two families which claim that the other committed some travesty in the distant past each time a member of the one family kills a member of the other the other family thinks that it is justified in killing a that member of the first family now let s suppose that this sequence has occurred an infinite number of times or if you don t like dealing with infinities suppose that one member of the family goes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing that is there is a never ending loop of slayings based on some non existent travesty how do you resolve this well they are all murders now i suppose that this isn t totally applicable to your problem but it still is possible to reduce an uninduced system and in any case the nested murderer in the definition of murder cannot be infintely recursive given the finite existence of humanity and a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved so the first person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily a murderer is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently unreducable definition see in a totally objective system where all the information is available such a nested definition isn t really a problem keith

re the problem of satan used to be islamic authority over women in article apr news unomaha edu trajan cwis unomaha edu stephen mcintyre writes of course bobby then states that satan has no free will that he does as god wants him to this brings up a host of paradoxes is god therefore evil do i have free will or is god directing me also if god is evil which part of his infinite self is good and which is evil etc i would like for once a solid answer not a run about i hope i gave you a fairly solid answer to this one i simply don t agree with the embodied version of a satan who is a separate creation or a force i wrote the belief to which i ascribe is that evil is not a creation rather it is the absence of good this fits with all the logic about things having dual use e g a knife can be used to sculpt and it can be used to kill like entropy evil is seen in this view as neither force nor entity satan is therefore metaphorical in fact there are several verses of the holy qur an which appear to support this view and several traditions as well for example there is a tradition that food should never be left open on a shelf or table overnight lest satan enter it it appears that this is a reference to as yet undiscovered germs thus the evil effect of spoiled food is described as satan but there are many examples of satan personified which am i to believe and there are quite physical descriptions of heaven and hell in the holy qur an the bible etc there have been times in the spiritual and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical descriptions of heaven hell and satan were taken quite literally and that worked for the time as i mentioned in the tradition cited above for example it was sufficient in the absence of a theory about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the evil which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as satanic which begs the question if satan in this case is metaphorical how can you be certain allah is not the same way the bottom line here however is that describing a spiritual plane in human language is something like describing color to a person who has been blind from birth you may want to read the book flatland if you haven t already or the dragon s egg the first is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con cept some deleted for space saving when language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers then such conventions as metaphor allegory and the like come to be necessary the unseen is described in terms which have reference and meaning for the reader listener but like all models a compro mise must be made when speaking metaphorically clarity and directness of meaning equivalence of perception and the like are all crippled but what else can you do this is why i asked the above how would you then know god exists as a spirit or being rather than just being metaphorical i mean it s okay to say well satan is just metaphorical but then you have to justify this belief and justify that god is not some metaphor for something else i say this because there are many many instances of satan described as a being such as the tormentor in the old testament book of job or the temptor in the new testament gospels in the same way god too is described as a being or spirit how am i to know one is metaphorical and not the other further belief in god isn t a bar to evil let s consider the case of satanists even if satan were metaphorical the satanist would have to believe in god to justify this belief again we have a case where someone does believe in god but by religious standards they are evil if bobby does see this let him address this question also deleted some more on metaphor obviously more philosophizing on this issue is possible but i m not sure that the readers of this newsgroup would want to delve into religious interpretation further however if anyone wishes to discuss this i m certainly willing either off line e mail or on line posting stephen atheist libertarian pro individuality pro responsibility jr and all that jazz

re concerning god s morality was americans and evolution in article apr batman bmd trw com jbrown batman bmd trw com writes why do babies get diseases etc what god did create was life according to a protein code which is mutable and can evolve without delving into a deep discussion of creationism vs evolutionism here s the main problem the scenario you outline is reasonably consistent but all the evidence that i am familiar with not only does not support it but indicates something far different the earth by latest estimates is about billion years old and has had life for about billion of those years humans have only been around for at most about years but the fossil evidence inidcates that life has been changing and evolving and in fact disease ridden long before there were people yes there are fossils that show signs of disease mostly bone disorders of course but there are some heck not just fossil evidence but what we ve been able to glean from genetic study shows that disease has been around for a long long time if human sin was what brought about disease at least indirectly though necessarily then how could it exist before humans god created the original genetic code perfect and without flaw and without getting sidetracked into the theological ramifications of the original sin the main effect of the so called original sin for this discussion was to remove humanity from god s protection since by their choice a e cut themselves off from intimate fellowship with god in addition their sin caused them to come under the dominion of satan who then assumed dominion over the earth deletions since humanity was no longer under god s protection but under satan s dominion it was no great feat for satan to genetically engineer diseases both bacterial viral and genetic although the forces of natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species the degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this uh i know of many evolutionary biologists who know more about biology than you claim to who will strongly disagree with this there is no evidence that the human genetic code or any other started off in perfect condition it seems to adapt to its envionment in a collective sense i m really curious as to what you mean by the degeneration of the genetic code human dna being more complex tends to accumulate errors adversely affecting our well being and ability to fight off disease while the simpler dna of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in causing infection and disease it is a bad combination umm nah we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and bacteria and they to us only a very small percentage of microlife is harmful to humans and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby constant in size but the ranks keep changing for example bubonic plague used to be a really nasty disease i m sure you ll agree but it still pops up from time to time even today and doesn t do as much damage part of that is because of better sanitation but even when people get the disease the symptoms tend to be less severe than in the past this seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible died off long ago and because the really nasty variants overgrazed forgive the poor terminology i m an engineer not a doctor and died off for lack of nearby hosts i could be wrong on this but from what i gather acne is only a few hundred years old and used to be nastier though no killer it seems to be getting less nasty w age hence we have newborns that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial diseases disorders now wait a minute i have a question humans were created perfect right and you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease it seems unlikely that satan who s making the diseases would also gift humans with the means to fight them off simpler to make the diseases less lethal if he wants survivors as far as i can see our immune systems imperfect though they may presently be must have been built into us by god i want to be clear on this are you saying that god was planning ahead for the time when satan would be in charge by building an immune system that was not at the time of design necessary that is god made our immune systems ahead of time knowing that adam and eve would sin and their descendents would need to fight off diseases this may be more of a mystical supernatural explanation than you are prepared to accept but god is not responsible for disease even if satan had nothing to do with the original inception of disease evolution by random chance would have produced them since humanity forsook god s protection here s another puzzle what exactly do you mean by perfect in the phrase created perfect and without flaw to my mind a perfect system would be incapable of degrading over time a perfect system that will without constant intervention become imperfect is not a perfect system at least imho or is it that god did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a bunch of gum wrappers held together with elmer s glue that is the original genetic instructions were perfect but were written in inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart if so why could god not have used better materials was god incapable of creating a system that could maintain itself of did it just choose not to deletions in summary newborns are innocent but

re an anecdote about islam date apr gmt from jon livesey livesey solntze wpd sgi com in article bu edu jaeger buphy bu edu gregg jaeger writes i don t understand the point of this petty sarcasm it is a basic principle of islam that if one is born muslim or one says i testify that there is no god but god and mohammad is a prophet of god that so long as one does not explicitly reject islam by word then one must be considered muslim by all muslims so the phenomenon you re attempting to make into a general rule or psychology is a direct odds with basic islamic principles if you want to attack islam you could do better than than to argue against something that islam explicitly contradicts then mr mozumder is incorrect when he says that when committing bad acts people temporarily become atheists jon of course b m is not incorrect he is defending islam when defending islam against infidels you can say anything and no one will dare criticize you but when an atheist uses the same argument he is using petty sarcasm so b m can have his temporary atheists whenever he needs them and all the temporary atheists can later say that they were always good muslims because they never explicitly rejected islam temporary atheism temporary islam temporary marriage none of it sticks a teflon religion how convenient and so easy to clean up after but then what would you expect from a bunch of people who can t even agree on the phases of the moon
re concerning god s morality long this kind of argument cries for a comment jbrown batman bmd trw com wrote in article apr leland stanford edu galahad leland stanford edu scott compton writes jim you originally wrote god did not create disease nor is he responsible for the maladies of newborns what god did create was life according to a protein code which is mutable and can evolve without delving into a deep discussion of creationism vs evolutionism god created the original genetic code perfect and without flaw do you have any evidence for this if the code was once perfect and has degraded ever since we should have some evidence in favour of this statement shouldn t we perhaps the biggest imperfection of the code is that it is full of non coding regions introns which are so called because they intervene with the coding regions exons an impressive amount of evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin it is likely that early exons represented early protein domains is the number of introns decreasing or increasing it appears that intron loss can occur and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon intron structure in their genes on the other hand the possibility that introns have been inserted later presents several logical difficulties introns are removed by a splicing mechanism this would have to be present but unused if introns are inserted moreover intron insertion would have required precise targeting random insertion would not be tolerated since sequences for intron removal self splicing of mrna are conserved besides transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace long terminal repeats and target site duplications and these are not found in or near intron sequences i seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and genetics before posting theological arguments like this try watson s molecular biology of the gene or darnell lodish baltimore s molecular biology of the cell for starters remember the question was posed in a theological context why does god cause disease in newborns and my answer is likewise from a theological perspective my own it is no less valid than a purely scientific perspective just different scientific perspective is supported by the evidence whereas theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion i think you misread my meaning i said god made the genetic code perfect but that doesn t mean it s perfect now it has certainly evolved since for the worse would you please cite a few references that support your assertion your assertion is less valid than the scientific perspective unless you support it by some evidence in fact it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps more important than we ve thought for instance sex might have evolved as defence against parasites this view is supported by computer simulations of evolution eg tierra perhaps i thought it was higher energy rays like x rays gamma rays and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage in fact it is thermal energy that does most of the damage although it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action actually neither of us knows what the atmosphere was like at the time when god created life according to my recollection most biologists do not claim that life began billion years ago after all that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth was created it would still be too primitive to support life i seem to remember a figure more like to billion years ago for the origination of life on earth anyone with a better estimate i d replace created with formed since there is no need to invoke any creator if the earth can be formed without one most recent estimates of the age of the earth range between billion years and earliest signs of life not true fossils but organic stromatolite like layers date back to billion years this would leave more than billion years for the first cells to evolve i m sorry i can t give any references this is based on the course on evolutionary biochemistry i attended here dominion it was no great feat for satan to genetically engineer diseases both bacterial viral and genetic although the forces of natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species the degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this again do you want this be true or do you have any evidence for this supposed degeneration i can understand scott s reaction excuse me but this is so far fetched that i know you must be jesting do you know what pathogens are do you know what point mutations are do you know that everything can come about spontaneously in response to your last statement no and neither do you you may very well believe that and accept it as fact but you cannot know that i hope you don t forget this we have evidence that suggests everything can come about spontaneously do you have evidence against this conclusion in science one does not have to believe in anything it is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve but the right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so and not to present one s own conclusions prior to this theology does not use this method therefore i seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusions human dna being more complex tends to accumulate errors adversely affecting our well being and ability to fight off disease while the simpler dna of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in causing infection and disease it is a bad combination hence we have newborns that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial diseases disorders you are supposing a purpose not a valid move bacteria and viruses do not exist to cause disease they are just another manifests of a general principle of evolution only replication saves replicators from degradiation we are just an efficient method for our dna to survive and replicate the less efficient methods didn t make it to the present and for the last time please present some evidence for your claim that human dna is degrading through evolutionary processes some people have claimed that the opposite is true we have suppressed our selection and thus are bound to degrade i haven t seen much evidence for either claim but then i ask so where is this relevant to my discussion in answering john s question of why why are there genetic diseases and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require babies to develop antibodies is it god s fault the original question i say no it is not of course nothing evil is god s fault but your explanation does not work it fails miserably you may be right but the fact is that you don t know that satan is not responsible and neither do i suppose that a powerful evil being like satan exists would it be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills that affect mankind i don t think so he could have done a much better job pun intended the problem is it seems no satan is necessary to explain any diseases they are just as inevitable as any product of evolution did i say that where seems to me like another bad inference actually what you ve done is to oversimplify what i said to the point that your summary of my words takes on a new context i never said that people are meant presumably by god to be punished by getting diseases why i did say is that free moral choices have attendent consequences if mankind chooses to reject god as people have done since the beginning then they should not expect god to protect them from adverse events in an entropic universe i am not expecting this if god exists i expect him to leave us alone i would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed free this is an interesting philosophical question and the answer is not as clear cut as it seems to be what consequences would you expect from rejecting allah oh i admit it s not perfect yet but i m working on it a good library or a bookstore is a good starting point what does this have to do with the price of tea in china or the question to which i provided an answer biology and genetics are fine subjects and important scientific endeavors but they explain how god created and set up life processes they don t explain the why behind creation life or its subsequent evolution why is there a why behind and your proposition was something that is not supported by the evidence this is why we recommend these books is there any need to invoke any why behind a prime mover evidence for this if the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention as recent cosmological theories hawking et al suggest why do people still insist on this thanks scotty for your fine and sagely advice but i am not highly motivated to learn all the nitty gritty details of biology and genetics although i m sure i d find it a fascinating subject for i realize that the details do not change the big picture that god created life in the beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its environment i m sorry but they do there is no evidence for your big picture and no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation it can come into existence

re keith schneider stealth poster mam mouse cmhnet org mike mcangus writes let me see if i understand what you are saying in order to talk knowledgeably about religion atheists must first have been so immersed in a religion that only the rare individual could have left no you don t understand i said that i don t think people can discuss the subjective merits of religion objectively this should be obvious people here have said that everyone would be better off without religion but this almost certainly isn t true but really are you threatened by the motto or by the people that use it the motto is a tool let s try to take away the tool but guns and axes are tools both of which have been used for murder should both be taken away that is to say i don t think motto misuse warrants its removal at least not in this case keith
re keith schneider stealth poster cmtan iss nus sg tan chade meng dan writes i somewhat agree with u however what it comes to theist religion it s a different matter that s because religion is like a drug once u use it it s very difficult to get out of it that s because in order to experience a religion u necessarily have to have blind faith and once u have the blind faith it s very diffcult for you to reason yourself back to atheism again therefore it s unreasonable to ask people to try religion in order to judge it it s like asking people to try dying to find out what death is like well now we can t judge death until we are dead right so why should we judge religion without having experienced it people have said that religion is bad by any account and that it is in no way useful etc but i don t totally agree with this of course we cannot really say how the religious folk would act had they not been exposed to religion but some people at least seemed to be helped in some ways by it so basically we can not judge whether religion is the right route for a given individual or even for a general population we can say that it is not best for us personally at least you can choose not to use religion might be hard to try to find out its benefits as you state above keith
re political atheists mmwang adobe com michael wang writes i was looking for a rigorous definition because otherwise we would be spending the rest of our lives arguing what a christian really believes i don t think we need to argue about this ks do you think that the motto points out that this country is proud ks of its freedom of religion and that this is something that ks distinguishes us from many other countries mw no ks well your opinion is not shared by most people i gather perhaps not but that is because those seeking to make government recognize christianity as the dominant religion in this country do not think they are infringing on the rights of others who do not share their beliefs yes but also many people who are not trying to make government recognize christianity as the dominant religion in this country do no think the motto infringes upon the rights of others who do not share their beliefs and actually i think that the government already does recognize that christianity is the dominant religion in this country i mean it is don t you realize recognize this this isn t to say that we are supposed to believe the teachings of christianity just that most people do like i ve said before i personally don t think the motto is a major concern if you agree with me then what are we discussing ks since most people don t seem to associate christmas with jesus much ks anymore i don t see what the problem is can you prove your assertion that most people in the u s don t associate christmas with jesus anymore no but i hear quite a bit about christmas and little if anything about jesus wouldn t this figure be more prominent if the holiday were really associated to a high degree with him or are you saying that the association with jesus is on a personal level and that everyone thinks about it but just never talks about it that is can you prove that most people do associate christmas most importantly with jesus anyways the point again is that there are people who do associate christmas with jesus it doesn t matter if these people are a majority or not i think the numbers do matter it takes a majority or at least a majority of those in power to discriminate doesn t it keith
re political atheists livesey solntze wpd sgi com jon livesey writes the probability that the automobile system will kill someone innocent in an accident goes asymptotically close to just like the court system however anyone who doesn t like the automobile system can opt out as i have this isn t true many people are forced to use the automobile system i certainly don t use it by choice if there were other ways of getting around i d do it secondly we do try to make the automobile system as safe as possible because we do recognize the danger to the innocent whereas the us the current example is not trying to make the court system safer which it could fairly easily do by replacing fatal punishments with non fatal punishments but i think that the court system has been refined over hundreds of years in the us britain and other countries we have tried to make it as fair as possible can it be made better without removing the death penalty besides life imprisonment sounds like a fatal punishment to me keith

re pompous ass mvs psuvm psu edu writes many people would probably think especially if the fanatics propogandized this that this was a conflict between the atheists and the religious many would get the impression that we were trying to outlaw religion if we contintue to try to remove all things with a religious reference that s not what the people i ve asked think perhaps you would be right if you said the fundamentalists would think this way after all they think they are being oppressed when they are not allowed to oppress however you have not shown where you get this idea that many people would probably think it s atheism vs religion winner take all as far as i can tell it is your groundless prediction that this will happen but you haven t taken into the account of propoganda remember if you asked germans before wwii if the jews shoudl be slaughtered they would probably answer no but after the propoganda machine rolled through at least some were able to tolerate it you see it only takes a small group of fanatics to whip up a general frenzy the propoganda machines have been in gear over a number of issues including abortion and gays look at some of the things that have happened well so far they have passed one amendment which is currently under intense scrutiny and they have failed to outlaw abortion which is their prime goal on that issue yep they seem sooo effective sure well they haven t managed to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity of the courts but they have managed to create quite a few problems for people that wanted to have an abortion they could create similar problems for us and it could be worse they can try to stop abortions by blocking clinics etc but imagine what they d have to do to stop atheism besides the margin of error is very large when you only talk to two people better than your one that is your opinion also i have branched out and the informal survey is up over half a dozen now and what have they said were you questions unbiased keith you would claim that my questions are biased the minute i posted them because the answers agreed with me everyone i have asked about the possible removal of the motto the christian portion has expressed regret about its loss because they like it however when it is pointed out to them that a new motto will not be in the works none have expressed the desire to rape murder pillage etc which you have basically claimed so you are able to convince them individually but could you convince a whole room of them a whole nation as for the atheist portion i know some around here they have all expressed disgust with the motto some noted being harassed by christians who used the motto to try to seem justified and all would see it gone yes i d be glad if it were gone to i ve never supported it however i think that it is a minor problem that can be easily ignored contrasted with what could happen an what may be likely which christians designed the motto does the motto say anything about jesus why do you think that it refers only to christians christians wrote it christians think that their religion is right and all others are wrong therefore why would they include other religions in the realm of being correct i doubt that any other religions were meant to be included well i am not clear on the religious convictions of francis scott key the motto can be attributed to him but it is at least clear that he believed in a god and surely there are a few christians that think as you say but i don t think that most do do you think that all christians actively despise other religions most that i have met haven t and don t do so no christian that i have queried thinks it means anything but them and only them why not ask some people of other faiths sorry i would but christianity is just so awfully popular around here suppose you could ask a few people well i have asked a hindu moselem and a few jews and all of them think that it is applicable to them of course i can t say that these people just some that i know pretty well are accurate representations of their faiths it is always a good idea to assume that there were dissenting views on any given issue you are assuming that all the views were the same and nothing leads to this conclusion without evidence to the contrary i doubt that there were dissenting opinions you claim there were provide some evidence for your assertion well i d really like to and i ve tried but i really don t know where to get access to congressional records from the s can anyone help out here comparing christians to nazis interesting only in the sense that neither can probably convinced to change their beliefs no again the motto on the money doesn t cost you anything extra however if you abolished the motto we d all have to pay to have all the dies and plates redone like people paid before to get them changed to have the motto on them you now need to show that there is a good reason to change everything again also i doubt that they use th same plates for more than a year s printing this would make it easy to remove the motto simply make next year s plates without it your claim evidently is that they will have to pay extra somewhere provide some evidence for this assertion so are you saying that they redesign the plates each year anyway your whole argument conveniently deleted i see was that the motto somehow costs us all a lot of money this is just not correct the ones i read didn t mention anything about jesus i think the issue was concerning the distinction between religion and not how could it be between religious and not religious the motto refers to god it is a religious motto the question is whether or not it is only christian you say it is more i doubt this provide some evidence for this assertion that is to say the religion of this country and the non religion of the ussr that was what most of those quotes were about and some included all atheists in general as well i don t think that any of the quotes although i seem to have lost them mentioned anything at all about jesus they advocated religion over non religion a specific religion was not mentioned you have missed this point i said that the motto didn t say anything about anyone in particular that is the motto doesn t imply anything about your particular beliefs it doesn t say that everyone trusts in some form of god only that the nation on the whole does we have been through this before it s obvious it does not include me this much is beyond doubt your claim again is that the motto refers to more than christians based on the facts that christianity says all other religions are wrong and because it seems that the motto was written by christians i doubt your claim so you are saying that all christians must believe that all other religions should be outlawed just because they think they are wrong that s silly i think the flat earthers are wrong but i don t advocate their banishment based on this idea i doubt that any additional expense would even be incurred by removing the motto provide some evidence for your claim that it would i think that any such cost would be insignificant i mentioned the slight cost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by being on our currency disregarding the digression of the other motto if it is used for harassment and no other purpose has been found for it why should it not be removed well mottos in general don t really have purposes i don t think it should be removed because i think the benefit would be outweighed by the consequences and do you know what the vote was were there other opinions do you think that the main reason the motto was required by law was to bother atheists do you think that this is what the majority of congress at the time had in mind if you do then show why again it is the opinion of the people who put it there that i am concerned with then you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress again it is not necessary that the complete majority shared the purpose of confronting godless communism with this motto why not it is the majority that put it there the general public probably does not know about the anti atheist intent of a few people in the s either i daresay more people remember the s than the time when key wrote the anthem but do they remember the debate surrounding the motto do they remember that some people intended it to be a message against atheists why don t you include this in your little survey that you were conducting you claim here that scientists would believe someone s claims i doubt this provide evidence for your assertion what should i ask some scientists the probability that something einstein said about relativity is worthy i mean if einstein said it there s a good chance that it was right at least at the time as for the courts the method scientists use can be applied i need not agree with the court by default because of a good record you need not agree with them all of the time but you would certainly think that their decisions would be good evidence in favor of some point what but you said you didn t agree with the court because they allowed congress to attempt to make an amendment prohibiting flag burning if you don t realize that something like this is external to the realm of the court s power then how can i be confident that you know anything about the court s powers i mean if you don t know how the court works how can you participate in a discussion of the court a judge can go to speak before congress and still you ignore the abortion gag rule as you make your claims on abortion no i think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a supreme court justice to testify before congress during the consideration of a constitutional amendment and in order for the court to rule on something a case usually must be presented mushrooms flowers trees buildings signs whatever the analogy is the same just because something that i might find offensive is present doesn t mean that my rights are being violated we are talking about something put there by people keith not a mushroom no one caused that mushroom to exist unless you re finding things offensive in a mushroom farm yes some mushrooms can be planted and i don t appreciate mushrooms on my pizza either this is not the case with the motto and you re ignoring the harassment which is the only known result of the motto and you re ignoring that somewhere along the line people were forced to put the motto there who was forced to put the motto there what do you mean keith

re biblical rape in article apr watson ibm com strom watson ibm com rob strom writes deletion the thread biblical rape was initiated by david o hunt here is his posting in article feu ko xsf kpc p andrew cmu edu david o hunt bluelobster cmu edu writes i m pretty sure i ve seen biblical rules for when it s allowable to rape prisoners what the codes are about that etc could some more knowledgable soul than i please let me know some references he asked a very narrow question and i gave a very narrow answer yes sorry i have got that wrong my apology deletion no david hunt s post didn t mention a god nor did my response you were the first to bring up the idea of the bible being given by god most jews don t believe this in any literal sense so no fun but i must have met the minority then and given by god refers to any action whereby a god god causes or better effects something rob i am not intimate with jewish theology but i understand that you are a messianic jew correct me if i am wrong but it appears that the views of messianic jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of jews while jewish theology overall is quite distinct from the christianic god views i have heard that it is possible for jews to attribute evil to their god an no no for christians the bible is still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man deletion no i thought we agreed that though jews disagree there are a set of core beliefs that they do agree upon one of which is that the commandments are accessible and written in the language of the time and another of which is that there must be a legal system to update them the context was metaphysics even when the process of adapting the commandments is not transcendent the justification of the process lie in metaphysic specualtion i wonder how you break out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system deletion could you explain this with respect to the original commandments being discussed that is the commandment that says if you feel like raping a woman prisoner you should instead wait and marry her what about the way this commandment is given invalidates it is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other reprehensible deeds the context is repulsive and it is foul play imo to invoke some relatively enlightened passages as an example for the content of the whole book big deletion the point is that i see that there is a necessary connection between the theology you use and the interpretation of the bible only very loosely my interpretation of the bible is based on a long tradition of jewish scholars interpreting the bible theology doesn t really enter into it there are jewish atheists who interpret the laws of charity essentially the same way i do no not the interpretation of some laws but the interpretation of the bible as in the example that sodom and gomorrha mean argue with god the whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows you to argue with a god whatever that means that alone is a theo logic question is proof of a theology used you pose another metaphysical riddle no you do well you wrote this fine so we have some major spirit with neither absolute power nor absolute knowledge and as it appears limited means or will to communicate with us some form of spiritual big friend do you admit that using god in this context is somewhat unusual am i right in the assumption that it cannot have created the universe as well and that the passages in the bible referring to that or its omnipotence are crap that s what i meant by the riddle it is an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh sodom and gomorrha means either there is some connection between the text the fact that it exists and your interpretation of it or it is purely arbitrary further the question is why is has one to carry the burden of biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better you might answer that one can t becuase some peculiar biblical information might be lost but that holds true of every other book and the question remains why has the bible still a special place can t it be replaced somehow is it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the bible against some other message that is included as well deletion do you see the danger in doing so especially with the metaphers used in the bible i think the danger of doing so is less than either the danger of having a frozen system of laws or having no laws sorry but there are worse systems does not say anything about if one could not have a better system deletion if we read two stories about the importance of helping the poor and in one god is a spirit and in the other god has a body which is more important helping the poor or resolving the contradiction about the corporeal nature of god if we read two stories in the bible one that god commands people to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills children directly what is more important to resolve the message that children are to be killed or if it has to be done by god and the argument you have given is a fallacy while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not it can be crucial in other questions religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god one cannot resolve questions by the statement do what is good when what is good depends on the question benedikt

re gospel dating benedikt rosenau writes the argument goes as follows q oid quotes appear in john but not in the almost codified way they were in matthew or luke however they are considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of q as such and not an entirely different source assuming you are presenting it accurately i don t see how this argument really leads to any firm conclusion the material in john i m not sure exactly what is referred to here but i ll take for granted the similarity to the matt luke q material is different hence one could have almost any relationship between the two right up to john getting it straight from jesus mouth we are talking date of texts here not the age of the authors the usual explanation for the time order of mark matthew and luke does not consider their respective ages it says matthew has read the text of mark and luke that of matthew and probably that of mark the version of the usual theory i have heard has matthew and luke independently relying on mark and q one would think that if luke relied on matthew we wouldn t have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies for one thing as it is assumed that john knew the content of luke s text the evidence for that is not overwhelming admittedly this is the part that is particularly new to me if it were possible that you could point me to a reference i d be grateful unfortunately i haven t got the info at hand it was i think in the late s or early s and it was possibly as old as ce when they are from about why do they shed doubt on the order on putting john after the rest of the three because it closes up the gap between supposed writing and the existing copy quit a bit the further away from the original the more copies can be written and therefore survival becomes more probable and i don t think a one step removed source is that bad if luke and mark and matthew learned their stories directly from diciples then i really cannot believe in the sort of big transformation from jesus to gospel that some people posit in news reports one generally gets no better information than this and if john is a diciple then there s nothing more to be said that john was a disciple is not generally accepted the style and language together with the theology are usually used as counterargument i m not really impressed with the theology argument but i m really pointing this out as an if and as i pointed out earlier one cannot make these arguments about i peter i see no reason not to accept it as an authentic letter one step and one generation removed is bad even in our times compare that to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies the best analogy would be reporters talking to the participants which is not so bad in other words one does not know what the original of mark did look like and arguments based on mark are pretty weak but the statement of divinity is not in that section and in any case it s agreed that the most important epistles predate mark c wingate the peace of god it is no peace but strife closed in the sod mangoe cs umd edu yet brothers pray for but one thing tove mangoe the marv lous peace of god

re why is sex only allowed in marriage rationality was islamic marriage in apr proxima alt za lucio proxima alt za lucio de re writes darice yoyo cc monash edu au fred rice writes my point of view is that the argument all sexism is bad just simply does not hold let me give you an example how about permitting a woman to temporarily leave her job due to pregnancy should that be allowed it happens to be sexist as it gives a particular right only to women nevertheless despite the fact that it is sexist i completely support such a law because i think it is just fred you re exasperating sexism like racialism is a form of discrimination using obvious physical or cultural differences to deny one portion of the population the same rights as another in this context your example above holds no water whatsoever there s no discrimination in denying men maternity leave in fact i m quite convinced that were anyone to experiment with male pregnancy it would be possible for such a future father to take leave on medical grounds okay i argued this thoroughly about weeks ago men and women are different physically physiologically and psychologically much recent evidence for this statement is present in the book brainsex by anne moir and david jessel i recommend you find a copy and read it their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic and is well referenced now if women and men are different in some ways the law can only adequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are different by also taking into account the ways in which men and women are different maternity leave is an example of this it takes into account that women get pregnant it does not give women the same rules it would give to men because to treat women like it treats men in this instance would be unjust this is just simply an obvious example of where men and women are intrinsically different now people make the naive argument that sexism oppression however maternity leave is sexist because men do not get pregnant men do not have the same access to leave that women do not to the same extent or degree and therefore it is sexist no matter however much a man wants to get pregnant and have maternity leave he never can and therefore the law is sexist no man can have access to maternity leave no matter how hard he tries to get pregnant i hope this is clear maternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just because the sexism here just reflects the sexism of nature in making men and women different there are many other differences between men and women which are far more subtle than pregnancy and to find out more of these i recommend you have a look at the book brainsex your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious if men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically become women to have a womb and the other factors required for pregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is so your argument when it is examined is seen to be fallacious you are saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that women can have if they also become women which actually just supports my statement that maternity leave is sexist the discrimination comes in when a woman is denied opportunities because of her legally determined sexual inferiorities as i understand most religious sexual discrimination and i doubt that islam is exceptional the female is not allowed into the priestly caste and in general is subjugated so that she has no aspirations to rights which as an equal human she ought to be entitled to there is no official priesthood in islam much of this function is taken by islamic scholars there are female islamic scholars and female islamic scholars have always existed in islam an example from early islamic history is the prophet s widow aisha who was recognized in her time and is recognized in our time as an islamic scholar no matter how sweetly you coat it part of the role of religions seems historically to have served the function of oppressing the female whether by forcing her to procreate to the extent where there is no opportunity for self improvement or by denying her access to the same facilities the males are offered you have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions and i dispute it i could go on and on about women in islam etc but i recently reposted something here under the heading islam and women if it is still at your news site i suggest you read it it is reposted from soc religion islam so if it has disappeared from alt atheism it still might be in soc religion islam i forgot what its original title was though i will email it to you if you like the roman catholic church is the most blatant of the culprit because they actually istitutionalised a celibate clergy but the other religious are no different let a woman attempt to escape her role as child bearer and the wrath of god descends on her your statement that other religions are no different is i think a statement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than christianity and perhaps judaism i ll accept your affirmation

her path to achieve this aisha who i mentioned earlier was not only an islamic scholar but also was at one stage a military leader show me the equivalent of hillary rhodam clinton within islam and i

re soc motss et al princeton axes matching funds for boy scouts c wainwright eczcaw mips nott ac uk wrote i jim i always thought that homophobe was only a word used at act up rallies i didn t beleive real people used it let s see if we agree on the term s definition a homophobe is one who actively and militantly attacks homosexuals because he is actually a latent homosexual who uses his hostility to conceal his true orientation since everyone who disapproves of or condemns homosexuality is a homophobe your implication is clear it must necessarily follow that all men are latent homosexuals or bisexual at the very least crap crap crap crap crap a definition of any type of phobe comes from phobia an irrational fear of hence a homophobe not only in act up meetings the word is apparently in general use now or perhaps it isn t in the bible wouldst thou prefer if i were to communicate with thou in bilespeak does an arachnophobe have an irrational fear of being a spider does an agoraphobe have an irrational fear of being a wide open space do you understand english obviously someone who has phobia will react to it they will do their best to avoid it and if that is not possible they will either strike out or run away or do gaybashings occur because of natural processes people who definately have homophobia will either run away from gay people or cause them or themselves violence isn t that what i said what are you taking issue with here your remarks are merely parenthetical to mine and add nothing useful it would seem odd if homosexuality had any evolutionary function other than limiting population growth since evolution only occurs when the members of one generation pass along their traits to subsequent generations homosexuality is an evolutionary deadend if i take your usage of the term homophobe in the sense you seem to intend then all men are really homosexual and evolution of our species at least is going nowhere so every time a man has sex with a woman they intend to produce children hmm no wonder the world is overpopulated obviously you keep to the monty python song every sperm is sacred and if as you say it has a purpose as a means to limit population growth then it is by your own arguement natural consider the context i m talking about an evolutionary function one of the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of a species procreate those who don t have no purpose in that context another point is that if the offspring of each generation is to survive the participation of both parents is necessary a family must exist since homosexuals do not reproduce they cannot constitute a family since the majority of humankind is part of a family homosexuality is an evolutionary abberation contrary to nature if you will well if that is true by your own arguements homosexuals would have vanished years ago due to non procreation also the parent from single parent families should put the babies out in the cold now cos they must by your arguement die by your argument homosexuality is genetically determined as to your second point you prove again that you have no idea what context means i am talking about evolution the preservation of the species the fundamental premise of the whole process but it gets worse since the overwhelming majority of people actually prefer a heterosexual relationship homosexuality is a social abberation as well the homosexual eschews the biological imperative to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in the most fundamental social element the family but wait there s more read the above i expect you to have at least ten children by now with the family growing these days sex is less to do with procreation admittedly without it there would be no one but more to do with pleasure in pre pill and pre condom days if you had sex there was the chance of producing children these days is just ain t true people can decide whether or not to have children and when soon they will be able to choose it s sex c but that s another arguement so it s more of a lifestyle decision again by your arguement since homosexuals can not or choose not to reproduce they must be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children both are as unnatural as each other yet another non sequitur sex is an evolutionary function that exists for procreation that it is also recreation is incidental that homosexuals don t procreate means that sex is only recreation and nothing more they serve no evolutionary purpose since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some policy makers that they have civil rights they are now claiming that their sexuality is a preference a life style an orientation a choice that should be protected by law now if homosexuality is a mere choice and if it is both contrary to nature and anti social then it is a perverse choice they have even less credibility than before they became prominent people are people are people who are you to tell anyone else how to live their life are you god tm if so fancy a date here s pretty obvious dodge do you really think you ve said anything or do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement i am not telling anyone anything i am demonstrating that there are arguments against the practice of homosexuality providing it s a merely an alternate lifestlye that are not homophobic that one can reasonably call it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand i realize of course that this comes dangerously close to establishing a value and that atheists are compelled to object on that basis but if you are to be consistent you have no case in this regard to characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of the homosexual life style but since the charge is only intended to intimidate it s really just demogoguery and not to be taken seriously fact is jim there are far more persuasive arguments for suppressing homosexuality than those given but consider this a start again crap all your arguments are based on outdated ideals likewise the bible would any honest christian condemn the ten generations spawned by a bastard to eternal damnation or someone who crushes his penis either accidently or not both are in deuteronomy i m sure your comment pertains to something but you ve disguised it so well i can t see what where did i mention ideals out dated or otherwise your arguments are very reactionary do you have anything at all to contribute as to why homosexuals should be excluded from participation in scouting the reasons are the same as those used to restrict them from teaching by their own logic homosexuals are deviates social and biological since any adult is a role model for a child it is incumbent on the parent to ensure that the child be isolated from those who would do the child harm in this case harm means primarily social though that could be extended easily enough you show me anyone who has sex in a way that everyone would describe as normal and will take of my hat puma baseball cap to you one man s meat is another man s poison what has this got to do with anything would you pick a single point that you find offensive and explain your objections i would really like to believe that you can discuss this issue

actually did it and that islamic teachings have something to do with blowing up the wtc wtc world trade centre which was the building that was blown up i think okay to make some comments the person has only been accused innocent until proven guilty remember secondly there seem to be some holes in his accusation that i read about for instance if they guy used that particular van to blow up the building and then to go back and claim his deposit back afterwards he must be incredibly stupid perhaps salamen was one of those uneducated muslims we hear so much about nevertheless he was apparently smart enough to put together a very sophisticated bomb it doesn t seem to fit together somehow actually salameh was not the only person involved the other fellow was a chemical engineer working for allied signal who had specifically studied explosive devices in school believe it or not we actually allow radical muslim types to study things like this in our universities so much for the price of freedom from what i read the other fellow told salameh how to put it together over the phone the bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated type so to put a i assume complicated sophisticated bomb together from instructions over the phone one must need some brains i would expect despite this there have already been many attacks and threats against mosques and muslims in the united states as a consequence of his accusation i have read o k now please tell us where this is happening i live in the u s and i have heard very little about these mosque attacks there are many mosques in houston texas and i would like to know what is going on so i can verify this or is the great jewish media conspiracy keeping us from knowing about this in the u s we heard about the mosque attacks during the desert storm venture so why is it so quiet now maybe it is localized to new jersey i read this in an article in the australian muslim times the newspaper weekly of the australian muslim community if this is true perhaps one of the muslims based in north america if they see this posting can elaborate islamic teachings teach against harming the innocent in the qur an it explicitly teaches against harming innocents even in times of war the blowing up of the wtc and harming innocents is therefore in blatant contradiction to islamic teachings this means absolutely nothing plenty of people commit violence while following what they think are valid religious principles i have seen people post many things here from the koran which could be misinterpreted if that is the explanation you wish to use by an uneducated muslim to allow them to harm idolators and unbelievers the first thing every muslim says is that no muslim could have done that because islam teaches against harming innocents and we are supposed to take you word that it never happens what do you think is the consequence does allah strike them down before the alleged violence occurs of course not muslims commit the violent act and then everyone hides behind verses in the koran we re pretty hip to that trick and i even doubt that it will come up in the trials my defense is that i am muslim and islam teaches me not to harm the innocent therefore the people who were killed must not have been innocent sure we set off the bomb your honor but you must remember sir i am a muslim allah is all powerful allah would not have allowed this are you insulting my religion great defense eh just admit that there are some incredibly stupid violent muslims in the world and stop hiding from that fact it does no one any good to deny it it only makes the more reasonable muslims look like they are protecting the bad ones can you see that i don t deny this fact the thrust of my argument here is that a salameh is according to us law innocent as he has not been found guilty in a court of law as his guilt has not been established it is wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption b islam teaches us not to harm innocents if muslims who perhaps have not realized that islam teaches this perform such actions it is not because of the teachings of islam but rather in spite of and in contradiction to the teachings of islam this is an important distinction i should clarify what muslims usually mean when they say muslim in general anyone who calls themselves a muslim and does not do or outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of islam is considered to be a muslim thus one who might do things contrary to islam through ignorance for example does not suddenly not become a muslim if one knowingly transgresses islamic teachings and essential principles though then one does leave islam the term muslim is to be contrasted with mu min which means true believer however whether a muslim is in reality a mu min is something known only by god and perhaps that person himself so you will not find the term mu min used very much by muslims in alt atheism because it is not known to anybody except myself and god whether i for example am a true believer or not for example i could just be putting on a show here and in reality believe something opposite to what i write here without anyone knowing thus when we say muslims we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow islam whether in practice they might in ignorance transgress islamic teachings by muslim we do not necessarily mean mu min or true believer in islam fred rice darice yoyo cc monash edu au
re gospel dating mangoe cs umd edu charley wingate writes david wood writes extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence more seriously this is just a high falutin way of saying i don t believe what you re saying are you making a meta argument here in any case you are wrong think of those invisible pink unicorns also the existence if jesus is not an extradinary claim i was responding to the historical accuracy of biblical claims of which the existence of jesus is only one and one that was not even mentioned in my post you may want to complain that the miracles attributed to him do constitute such claims and i won t argue otherwise but that is a different issue wrong that was exactly the issue go back and read the context included within my post and you ll see what i mean now that i ve done you the kindness of responding to your questions please do the same for me answer the charley challenges your claim that they are of the did not did so variety is a dishonest dodge that i feel certain fools only one person dave wood
re and another thing mangoe cs umd edu charley wingate writes keith ryan writes you will ignore any criticism of your logic or any possible incongruenties in your stance you will not answer any questions on the validity of any opinion and or facts you state when i have to start saying that s not what i said and the response is did so there s no reason to continue if someone is not going to argue with my version of my position then they cannot be argued with but of course your version of your position has been included in the charley challenges so your claim above is a flat out lie further only last week you claimed that you might not answer the challenges because you were turned off by included text so which is it do you want your context included in my articles or not come to think of it this contradiction has the makings of a new entry in the next challenges post by the way i ve kept every bloody thing that you ve written related to this thread and will be only too pleased to re post any of it to back my position you seem to have forgotten that you leave an electronic paper trail on the net this is the usual theist approach no matter how many times a certain argument has been disproven shown to be non applicable or non sequitur they keep cropping up time after time speaking of non sequiturs this has little to do with what i just said and have some sauce for the goose some of the disproof is fallacies repeated over and over such as the law of nature argument someone posted recently now now let s not change the subject wouldn t it be best to finish up the thread in question before you begin new ones dave wood
periodic post of charley challenges with additions new in this version challenge plus an addendum summarizing charley s responses to date this is a posting made periodically in an attempt to encourage charley wingate to address direct challenges to his evidently specious claims i ll continue to re post periodically until he answers them publicly indicates that he won t answer them stops posting to alt atheism the alt atheism community tells me to stop or i get totally bored i apologize for the somewhat juvenile nature of this approach but i m at a loss to figure out another way to crack his intransigence and seeming intellectual dishonesty this is re post charley i can t help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers to substantive questions that have been raised in response to your previous posts i submit that you don t answer them because you cannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic and i once again challenge you to prove me wrong to make the task as easy for you as possible i ll present concise re statements of some of the questions that you have failed to answer in the hope that you may address them one at a time for all to see should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period i will re post this article with suitable additions and deletions at such time that i notice a post by you on another topic i will repeat this procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or you cease to post to this newsgroup i would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these questions previously and your answer missed my notice if you can be kind enough to re post or e mail such articles i will be only too pleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question and remove it from this list now to the questions after claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological patterns that you proposed then semi retracting that claim by stating that you weren t referring to all atheists i asked you to name some atheists who you feel don t fit your patterns to show that you indeed were not referring to all atheists that you are aware of you failed to do so please do so now question can you name any a a posters who do not fit into your stereotype here is the context for the question this is not true for everyone on this board and you are out of line in assuming that it is you however deleted the text further along where i said that i didn t mean to imply that everybody s experience was along the same lines whether or not you mean to make such implications you do so repeatedly allow me to approach the issue from another viewpoint can you name those atheists that you ve come across who do not fit into the patterns that you theorize you have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that senses and reason are all we have to go by and when pressed you have implied that we have an alternative called revelation i have repeatedly asked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses and reason you failed to do so please do so now question can you explain what is revelation and how one can experience and interpret it without using senses and inherent reasoning here is the context for the question revelation is not reason and if we do have revelation then reasoning is not all we have first show me that revelation exists second if revelation is not perceived through the senses how exactly is it perceived according to my webster s revelation is an act of revealing or communicating divine truth now tell me how such a thing can be revealed communicated other than via the senses tell me how you can interpret this revelation other than with reason that is using your brain to interpret what you are sensing when i say there is no way for a human being to interface with the universe other than via the senses as interpreted by reason your brain it is because this is the simple truth if you have another mechanism of interface by all means share it with us then later you cannot escape the fact that our entire interface with the universe is our senses and our reason period again this is indefensible no it is simple truth i challenge you to show me otherwise then later few mystics will agree to this assertion and the common defense of redefining senses to absorb for instance mystical experiences is begs the question of whether some senses are better than others i allow you the broadest definition of senses to make things easier for you now show me that mystical experiences exist remember you aren t allowed to go by testimony of others e g mystics since you have dismissed my testimony as unreliable you know tainted by my own bias further once these mystical thingies are absorbed show me evidence that a human can recognize and respond to them short of interpretation via that person s reasoning capabilities i challenge you to show me these things if you cannot do so you might as well give up the fight then later let me reiterate you have not explained your interpretation of your experiences so it is not possible for me to have attacked them in point of fact i specifically challenged you to explain this revelation stuff that you were talking about and i note for the record that you appear to have declined my challenge what is it how is it sensed how is it interpreted and how does this sensing and interpretation occur without the conduit of our senses and reasoning abilities you have answered none of these questions that go straight to the heart of your claims if you can t answer them your claims are entirely specious you have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by a a posters are unverifiable and fantastical i asked you to identify one such claim that i have made you have failed to do so please do so now question have i made any claims at all that are unverifiable and fantastical if so please repeat them here is the context for the question i must thank david wood a most sensitive and intelligent if wrong posting then later likewise the reference to unverifiable fantastical claims represents fairly accurately my reaction to all of the claims to dispassionate analysis that are repeated in this group give me your address and i ll be pleased to send you a dictionary failing that can you name one claim that i have made that is in any sense unverifiable or fantastical i demand that you retract this statement if you cannot offer up evidence if you follow your usual pattern of ignoring the challenge then you are simply an asshole first you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as a result of reason then later you stated that if one accepted the axioms of reason that one couldn t help but become atheist i asked you to explain the contradiction your only response was a statement that the question was incoherent an opinion not shared by others that i have asked be they atheist or theist you have failed to answer the question please do so now question do you retract your claim that a a posters have not become atheists as a result of reason despite their testimony to that effect if you don t retract that claim do you retract the subsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably result in atheism here is the context for the question first quote we have here a bunch of people who claim that their position is based on reason it is up to atheists to prove it to me then second quote but i do not see how one can accept these axioms and not end up with an atheistic point of view first you claimed that you would probably not answer these challenges because they contained too much in the way of included text from previous posts later you implied that you wouldn t respond because i was putting words in your mouth please clarify this seeming contradiction question do you prefer to respond to challenges that include context from your own posts or that i paraphrase your positions in order to avoid included text here is the context for the question first you said my ordinary rules are that i don t read articles over over lines or articles in which there is nothing but included text on the first screen these are not rules of morality but practicality then later if someone is not going to argue with my version of my position then they cannot be argued with as usual your responses are awaited with anticipation dave wood p s for the record below is a compilation of charley s responses to these challenges to date this makes no sense to me at all it gives the appearance either of utter incoherence or of answering some question of mr wood s imagination mr wood i do not subscribe to the opinion that a gauntlet thrown down on the net requires any response whatsoever at some point i might read and respond to your article and then again i might not my ordinary rules are that i don t read articles over over lines or articles in which there is nothing but included text on the first screen these are not rules of morality but practicality i left out something else i don t respond to utmost on my list of things to avoid are arguments about the arguments meta arguments as some call them when i have to start saying that s not what i said and the response is did so there s no reason to continue if someone is not going to argue with my version of my position then they cannot be argued with
re political atheists halat pooh bears jim halat writes i think an objective morality does exist but that most flavors of morality are only approximations to it once again a natural or objective morality is fairly easily defined as long as you have a goal in mind that is what is the purpose of this morality maybe i m not quite getting what you mean by this but i think objective morality is an oxymoron by definition it seems any goal oriented issue like this is subjective by nature i don t get how you re using the word objective but the goal need not be a subjective one for instance the goal of natural morality is the propogation of a species perhaps it wasn t really until the more intelligent animals came along that some revisions to this were necessary intelligent animals have different needs than the others and hence a morality suited to them must be a bit more complicated than the law of the jungle i don t think that self actualization is so subjective as you might think and by objectivity i am assuming that the ideals of any such system could be carried out completely keith
request for support i have a request for those who would like to see charley wingate respond to the charley challenges and judging from my e mail there appear to be quite a few of you it is clear that mr wingate intends to continue to post tangential or unrelated articles while ingoring the challenges themselves between the last two re postings of the challenges i noted perhaps a dozen or more posts by mr wingate none of which answered a single challenge it seems unmistakable to me that mr wingate hopes that the questions will just go away and he is doing his level best to change the subject given that this seems a rather common net theist tactic i would like to suggest that we impress upon him our desire for answers in the following manner ignore any future articles by mr wingate that do not address the challenges until he answers them or explictly announces that he refuses to do so or if you must respond to one of his articles include within it something similar to the following please answer the questions posed to you in the charley challenges really i m not looking to humiliate anyone here i just want some honest answers you wouldn t think that honesty would be too much to ask from a devout christian would you nevermind that was a rhetorical question dave wood
re gospel dating in article mimsy umd edu mangoe cs umd edu charley wingate writes assuming you are presenting it accurately i don t see how this argument really leads to any firm conclusion the material in john i m not sure exactly what is referred to here but i ll take for granted the similarity to the matt luke q material is different hence one could have almost any relationship between the two right up to john getting it straight from jesus mouth no the argument says john has known q ie a codified version of the logia and not the original assuming that there has been one it has weaknesses of course like that john might have known the original yet rather referred to q in his text or that the logia were given in a codified version in the first place the argument alone does not allow a firm conclusion but it fits well into the dating usually given for the gospels we are talking date of texts here not the age of the authors the usual explanation for the time order of mark matthew and luke does not consider their respective ages it says matthew has read the text of mark and luke that of matthew and probably that of mark the version of the usual theory i have heard has matthew and luke independently relying on mark and q one would think that if luke relied on matthew we wouldn t have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies for one thing not necessarily luke may have trusted the version he knew better than the version given by matthew improving on matthew would give a motive for instance as far as i know the theory that luke has known matthew is based on a statistical analysis of the texts as it is assumed that john knew the content of luke s text the evidence for that is not overwhelming admittedly this is the part that is particularly new to me if it were possible that you could point me to a reference i d be grateful yep but it will take another day or so to get the source i hope your german is good enough unfortunately i haven t got the info at hand it was i think in the late s or early s and it was possibly as old as ce when they are from about why do they shed doubt on the order on putting john after the rest of the three because it closes up the gap between supposed writing and the existing copy quit a bit the further away from the original the more copies can be written and therefore survival becomes more probable i still do not see how copies from allow to change the dating of john that john was a disciple is not generally accepted the style and language together with the theology are usually used as counterargument i m not really impressed with the theology argument but i m really pointing this out as an if and as i pointed out earlier one cannot make these arguments about i peter i see no reason not to accept it as an authentic letter yes but an if gives only possibilities and no evidence the authencity of many letters is still discussed it looks as if conclusions about them are not drawn because some pet dogmas of the churches would probably fall with them as well one step and one generation removed is bad even in our times compare that to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies the best analogy would be reporters talking to the participants which is not so bad well rather like some newsletter of a political party reporting from the big meeting not necessarily wrong but certainly bad in other words one does not know what the original of mark did look like and arguments based on mark are pretty weak but the statement of divinity is not in that section and in any case it s agreed that the most important epistles predate mark yes but the accuracy of their tradition is another problem question are there letters not from paul and predating mark claiming the divinity of jesus benedikt
re americans and evolution in article ba c ac i dbstu rz tu bs de i dbstu rz tu bs de benedikt rosenau writes in article pq tinn lp senator bedfellow mit edu bobs thnext mit edu robert singleton writes deletion i will argue that your latter statement i believe that no gods exist does rest upon faith that is if you are making a positive statement that no gods exist strong atheism rather than merely saying i don t know and therefore don t believe in them and don t not believe in then weak atheism once again to not believe in god is different than saying i believe that god does not exist i still maintain the position even after reading the faqs that strong atheism requires faith no it in the way it is usually used in my view you are saying here that driving a car requires faith that the car drives i m not saying this at all it requires no faith on my part to say the car drives because i ve seen it drive i ve done more than at in fact i ve actually driven it now what does require some faith is the belief that my senses give an accurate representation of what s out there but there is no evidence pro or con for the existence or non existence of god see what i have to say below on this for me it is a conclusion and i have no more faith in it than i have in the premises and the argument used sorry if i remain skeptical i don t believe it s entirely a conclusion that you have seen no evidence that there is a god is correct neither have i but lack of evidence for the existence of something is in no way evidence for the non existence of something the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they disprove evolution the establish creation you personally have never seen a neutrino before but they exist the pink unicorn analogy breaks down and is rather naive i have a scientific theory that explains the appearance of animal life evolution when i draw the conclusion that pink unicorns don t exist because i haven t seen them this conclusion has it s foundation in observation and theory a pink unicorn if it did exist would be qualitatively similar to other known entities that is to say since there is good evidence that all life on earth has evolved from more primitive ancestors these pink unicorns would share a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such god however has no such correspondence with anything imo there is no physical frame work of observation to draw any conclusions from but first let me say the following we might have a language problem here in regards to faith and existence i as a christian maintain that god does not exist to exist means to have being in space and time god does not have being god is being kierkegaard once said that god does not exist he is eternal with this said i feel it s rather pointless to debate the so called existence of god and that is not what i m doing here i believe that god is the source and ground of being when you say that god does not exist i also accept this statement but we obviously mean two different things by it however in what follows i will use the phrase the existence of god in it s usual sense and this is the sense that i think you are using it i would like a clarification upon what you mean by the existence of god no that s a word game i disagree with you profoundly on this i haven t defined god as existence in fact i haven t defined god but this might be getting off the subject although if you think it s relevant we can come back to it further saying god is existence is either a waste of time existence is already used and there is no need to replace it by god or you are implying more with it in which case your definition and your argument so far are incomplete making it a fallacy you are using wrong categories here or perhaps you misunderstand what i m saying i m making no argument what so ever and offering no definition so there is no fallacy i m not trying to convince you of anything i believe and that rests upon faith and it is inappropriate to apply the category of logic in this realm unless someone tells you that they can logically prove god or that they have evidence or then the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary btw an incomplete argument is not a fallacy some things are not even wrong deletion one can never prove that god does or does not exist when you say that you believe god does not exist and that this is an opinion based upon observation i will have to ask what observtions are you refering to there are no observations pro or con that are valid here in establishing a positive belief deletion where does that follow aren t observations based on the assumption that something exists i don t follow you here certainly one can make observations of things that they didn t know existed i still maintain that one cannot use observation to infer that god does not exist such a positive assertion requires a leap and wouldn t you say there is a level of definition that the assumption god is is meaningful if not i would reject that concept anyway so where is your evidence for that god is is meaningful at some level once again you seem to completely misunderstand me i have no evidence that god is is meaningful at any level maybe such a response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so many people try to run their own private conception of god down your throat i however am not doing this i am arguing one and only one thing that to make a positive assertion about something for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against requires a leap it requires faith i am as you would say a theist however there is a form of atheism that i can respect but it must be founded upon honesty benedikt bob singleton bobs thnext mit edu
re second law was albert sabin joel hanes jjh diag amdahl com wrote mr connor s assertion that more complex later in paleontology is simply incorrect many lineages are known in which whole structures are lost for example snakes have lost their legs cave fish have lost their eyes some species have almost completely lost their males kiwis are descended from birds with functional wings joel the statements i made were illustrative of the inescapably anthrpomorphic quality of any desciption of an evolutionary process there is no way evolution can be described or explained in terms other than teleological that is my whole point even those who have reason to believe they understand evolution biologists for instance tend to personify nature and i can t help but wonder if it s because of the limits of the language or the nature of nature bill

re not the omni charley wingate mangoe cs umd edu wrote please enlighten me how is omnipotence contradictory by definition all that can occur in the universe is governed by the rules of nature thus god cannot break them anything that god does must be allowed in the rules somewhere therefore omnipotence cannot exist it contradicts the rules of nature obviously an omnipotent god can change the rules when you say by definition what exactly is being defined certainly not omnipotence you seem to be saying that the rules of nature are pre existant somehow that they not only define nature but actually cause it if that s what you mean i d like to hear your further thoughts on the question bill

re is morality constant was re biblical rape jim perry perry dsinc com wrote xenophobia both de facto and de jure as implemented in legal systems is widespread while the bible although not egalitarian specifically preaches kindness to the stranger and emphasizes in the book of ruth that a foreigner can join the nation and give rise to one of the great heroes of the nation clearly better than the alternative but as an american what strikes me as strange about this story is that it should have even been considered an issue jim there are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread that are a little confusing an atheist is one for whom all things can be understood as processes of nature exclusively there is no need for any recourse to divnity to describe or explain anything there is no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by physics chemistry biology etc everything is random nothing is determnined this would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its products there is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence it s just a happy accident for an atheist no event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense and no thought about an event can have value the products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment from teaching training observation and experience and are only significant to the individual mind wherein they reside these mental processes and the images they produce for us are just electrical activity and nothing more content is of no consequence the human mind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a hill how then can an atheist judge value what is the basis for criticizing the values ennumerated in the bible or the purposes imputed to god on what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned it seems that in judging the values that motivate others to action you have to have some standard against which conduct is measured but what in nature can serve that purpose what law of nature can you invoke to establish your values since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event what difference could it possibly make what anyone does religious or otherwise there can be no meaning or gradation of value the only way an atheist can object to any behaviour is to admit that the objection is entirely subjective and that he she just doesn t like it that s it any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries no weight in any absolute sense that you don t like what god told people to do says nothing about god or god s commands it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with a pre existing thought set to form that reaction that your objections seem well founded is due to the way you ve been conditioned there is no truth content the whole of your intellectual landscape is an illusion a virtual reality i didn t make these rules it s inherent in naturalistic atheism and to be consistent you have to accept the non significance of any human thought even your own all of this being so you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values right wrong goood evil etc and cannot participate your opinion about the bible can have no weight whatsoever bill

re islam dress code for women in ba c i dbstu rz tu bs de i dbstu rz tu bs de benedikt rosenau writes in article apr monu cc monash edu au darice yoyo cc monash edu au fred rice writes deletion of course people say what they think to be the religion and that this is not exactly the same coming from different people within the religion there is nothing with there existing different perspectives within the religion perhaps one can say that they tend to converge on the truth my point is that they are doing a lot of harm on the way in the meantime and that they converge is counterfactual religions appear to split and diverge even when there might be a true religion at the core the layers above determine what happens in practise and they are quite inhumane usually what you post then is supposed to be an answer but i don t see what is has got to do with what i say i will repeat it religions as are harm people and religions don t converge they split giving more to disagree upon and there is a lot of disagreement to whom one should be tolerant or if one should be tolerant at all ideologies also split giving more to disagree upon and may also lead to intolerance so do you also oppose all ideologies i don t think your argument is an argument against religion at all but just points out the weaknesses of human nature big deletion do women have souls in islam people have said here that some muslims say that women do not have souls i must admit i have never heard of such a view being held by muslims of any era i have heard of some christians of some eras holding this viewpoint but not muslims are you sure you might not be confusing christian history with islamic history yes it is supposed to have been a predominant view in the turkish caliphate i would like a reference if you have got one for this is news to me anyhow that women are the spiritual equals of men can be clearly shown from many verses of the qur an for example the qur an says for muslim men and women for believing men and women for devout men and women for true men and women for men and women who are patient and constant for men and women who humble themselves for men and women who give in charity for men and women who fast and deny themselves for men and women who guard their chastity and for men and women who engage much in god s praise for them has god prepared forgiveness and a great reward qur an abdullah yusuf ali s translation there are other quotes too but i think the above quote shows that men and women are spiritual equals and thus that women have souls just as men do very clearly no it does not it implies that they have souls but it does not say they have souls and it is not given that the quote above is given a high priority in all interpretations one must approach the qur an with intelligence any thinking approach to the qur an cannot but interpret the above verse and others like it that women and men are spiritual equals i think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have souls does it make any sense for something without a soul to be forgiven or to have a great reward understood to be in the after life i think the usual answer would be no in which case the part saying for them has god prepared forgiveness and a great reward says they have souls if it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven then i have no idea what a soul is as for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority in all interpretations any thinking approach to the qur an has to give all verses of the qur an equal priority that is because according to muslim belief the whole qur an is the revelation of god in fact denying the truth of any part of the qur an is sufficient to be considered a disbeliever in islam quite similar to you other post even when the quran does not encourage slavery it is not justified to say that iit forbids or puts an end to slavery it is a non sequitur look any approach to the qur an must be done with intelligence and thought it is in this fashion that one can try to understand the quran s message in a book of finite length it cannot explicitly answer every question you want to put to it but through its teachings it can guide you i think however that women are the spiritual equals of men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse and that since women can clearly be forgiven and rewarded they must have souls from the above verse let s try to understand what the qur an is trying to teach rather than try to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this passage or that passage the misinterpretations of the qur an based on ignoring this verse or that verse are infinite but the interpretations fully consistent are more limited let s try to discuss these interpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can ignore this bit or that bit for that is just showing how people can try to twist islam for their own ends something i do not deny but provides no reflection on the true teachings of islam whatsoever fred rice darice yoyo cc monash edu au
re slavery was re why is sex only allowed in marriage in apr ennews eas asu edu guncer enuxha eas asu edu selim guncer writes you might not like what bernard lewis writes about label him as a zionist or such to discredit him etc you misrepresent me selim the hard evidence for my statements about his lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book orientalism by edward said edward said by the way is a christian not a muslim i think he is pretty much objective in his treatment in race and slavery in the middle east since he clearly distinguishes between slavery under islam and the practice of slavery in other countries like the us prior to the civil war he also does not conceal that there are verses in the quran which promote the liberation of slaves what he doesn t and i don t think nobody can deduce from these verses is that slavery will eventually be abolished in islamic countries now you might rather conveniently blame the practice of slavery on muslims but the facts are out there i also fail to see the relevance of the claim of lewis being a zionist to what i wrote regarding bernard lewis him being a zionist gives him a political motive for his giving misrepresentations and half truths about islam read orientalism by edward said see the evidence for yourself in fact i may post some of it here if it isn t too long they were encyclopaedic information which anybody can access that slavery was abolished at certain dates some years after muhammed that this was the cause of tensions in the ottoman empire between the arab slave traders and the government etc we also have in the asu library volumes of british documents on slavery where reports and documents concerning slavery all around the world can be found which i checked some of the incidents lewis mentions so i don t think ones political stance has anything to do with documentary evidence i haven t read lewis s article so i can t comment directly upon it and have only spoken about his writings in general so far that his political motives make him a biased writer on islam his anti islamic polemics as i understand it are often quite subtle and are often based on telling half truths again read orientalism by edward said i am not asking you to take what i say on trust in fact i am urging you not to do so but to get this book it is a well known book and check the evidence out for yourself the issue i raised was that slaves were used for sexual purposes when it was claimed that islam prohibits extra marital sex i wrote that the prophet himself had concubines i wrote an incident in which the prophet advised on someone who did not want his concubine to get pregnant etc which is contrary to the notion that sex is for procreation only in other words such claims are baseless in the quran and the hadith if slavery is in reality as opposed to in the practice of some muslims opposed by islam then using slaves for sexual purposes is necessarily opposed too i seem to be unsuccesful in getting through to you islam is not advocating slavery slavery was an existing institution in the th century it advised on slaves being freed for good deeds etc which is nothing new many cultures saw this as a good thing what is the problem here but i can argue rightfully that slaves were discouraged about thinking about their statuses politically the quran rewards the good slave so obey your master and perhaps one day you ll be free but it is very understandable that i do not communicate with muslims since they assume the quran is from a god and i think it is a rule based system imposed on the society for preservation of the status quo slaves are a part of this system the subordination of women so that their function in society boils down to child making is a part of this system etc i understand your point of view selim i think rather it is us who are not getting through to you some of the points you repeat above i have already answered before regarding women i have made posting after posting on this subject showing that islam is not anti woman etc however have you been completely ignoring my postings or just missing them i just reposted a very good one under the title islam and women reposted from soc religion islam if this has already disappeared from your site then please email me telling me so and i will email you a copy of this excellent article imho your understanding of the issue of women in islam is sadly deficient regarding slaves my posting on slavery the second one i made which is a repost of an article i wrote early last year is based completely on the qur an and contains numerous qur anic verses and hadiths to support its point of view our approaches are different you are arguing from a historical standpoint and i am arguing directly from the teachings of the qur an and hadiths now just because people say they are muslims and perform a particular action does that automatically mean that their action is part of islam even if it is opposed by the qur an and sunnah no of course not let me give you a concrete example which might help clarify this for you the qur an prohibits drinking now if a person says i am a muslim and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer does this now mean that islam teaches that people should drink beer of course not and only an idiot would think so do you see my point it is very natural to think that the author authors of the quran had no idea that the socio economic structure they were advocating would experience at least two paradigm shifts in years in the western cultures first with the end of the feudal era and the rise of commerce second with the industrial revolution well rules have changed and the status quo has driven muslim countries into misery trying to survive in a heathen world muslim countries have failed economically they were unable to accumulate any wealth directly due to the uncomprimising economic rules in the quran in fact the rise of islam can easily be modeled after the pyramid effect you do not produce any wealth at home but increase your wealth by conquering places you are judging islam here on capitalist terms capitalism is an ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth this assumption is in opposition to islamic teachings to say islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be capitalist this does not mean that islam does not support a free market for it does in general but there are other parts of capitalism which are opposed to islam as i understand it when this stopped you and i were left bare in the open for emperialists to devour no capital no industry very poor social services the education level in muslim countries are the lowest in the world the health statistics are miserable etc one can postulate numerous reasons for this your theory is that it is because islam is not secularist and capitalist etc etc selim i will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your views if you think as you obviously do that islam lack of education and power for a large part of history the islamic world was very powerful for a significant section of history the islamic world was the foremost in the sciences so to say that islam is for example anti education is completely absurd you try to blame this situation on islam history shows that your conclusion is false and that instead there must be other reasons for this situation you blame muslims for not following the quran but i blame muslims for following the quran well selim your viewpoint on women in islam makes me question the extent of your knowledge of islam i really think you are not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the muslims are following the qur an or not your idea is baseless from historical facts it is a poor utopia the islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one stage yet somehow in your theory it is by following the qur an that muslims are backwards in education selim it is your thesis that is anti historical for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradicts your theory while my ideas are derived from social and economic history you have certainly not shown this you have merely stated it so far it seems to me that your view on islam being anti education is quite contrary to history that you are so convinced of your views makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of this my solution to all muslims is simple cut the crap i think selim you should consider taking your own advice get the facts straight here too and work hard to reverse the effects of years of ignorance selim you have such conviction of your viewpoint yet you demonstrate ignorance not only of islam but also of islamic history particularly with respect to muslims being leaders of science till about or so i think yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history selim if i remember right you say in one of your earlier posts that you are an apostate from islam i think you should slow down and start thinking clearly about the issues and start reading some of our postings about islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously have fred rice darice yoyo cc monash edu au
re jews can t hide from keith cco in article pqdor s fido asd sgi com livesey solntze wpd sgi com jon livesey writes in article apr bmerh bnr ca dgraham bmers bnr ca douglas graham writes the poster casually trashed two thousand years of jewish history and ken replied that there had previously been people like him in germany i think the problem here is that i pretty much ignored the part about the jews sightseeing for years thinking instead that the important part of what the original poster said was the bit about killing palestinians in retrospect i can see how the sightseeing thing would be offensive to many i originally saw it just as poetic license but it s understandable that others might see it differently i still think that ken came on a bit strong though i also think that your advice to masud khan before you argue with someone like mr arromdee it s a good idea to do a little homework or at least think was unnecessary that s right there have been there have also been people who were formally nazis but the nazi party would have gone nowhere without the active and tacit support of the ordinary man in the street who behaved as though casual anti semitism was perfectly acceptable now what exactly don t you understand about what i wrote and why don t you see what it has to do with the matter at hand throughout all your articles in this thread there is the tacit assumption that the original poster was exhibiting casual anti semitism if i agreed with that then maybe your speech on why this is bad might have been relevant but i think you re reading a lot into one flip sentence while probably not true in this case too often the charge of anti semitism gets thrown around in order to stifle legitimate criticism of the state of israel anyway i d rather be somewhere else so i m outta this thread doug graham dgraham bnr ca my opinions are my own
alt atheism faq frequently asked questions archive name atheism faq alt atheism archive name faq last modified april version alt atheism frequently asked questions this file contains responses to articles which occur repeatedly in alt atheism points covered here are ones which are not covered in the introduction to atheism you are advised to read that article as well before posting these answers are not intended to be exhaustive or definitive the purpose of the periodic faq postings is not to stifle debate but to raise its level if you have something to say concerning one of these questions and which isn t covered by the answer given please feel free to make your point overview of contents what is the purpose of this newsgroup hitler was an atheist the bible proves it pascal s wager what is occam s razor why it s good to believe in jesus why i know that god exists einstein and god does not play dice everyone worships something why there must be a causeless cause the universe is so complex it must have been designed independent evidence that the bible is true godel s incompleteness theorem george bush on atheism and patriotism i know where hell is biblical contradictions wanted the usa is a christian nation the usa is not a christian nation subject what is the purpose of this newsgroup typical posting why have a newsgroup about atheism why do atheists organize in groups what is there to discuss response many things are discussed here including whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one s family prayer in schools discrimination against atheists sunday trading laws the satanic child abuse myth whether one should be an overt atheist or stay in the closet how religious societies prey sic on new college students how to get rid of unwanted proselytizers whether religion is a danger to society and or the individual why people become atheists of course inevitably alt atheism tends to attract evangelical christians looking for someone to convert most readers of the newsgroup don t want to be preached to although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure from tearing apart particularly ill considered or uninformed postings subject hitler was an atheist typical posting hitler was an atheist and look at what he did response adolf hitler was emphatically not an atheist as he said himself the folkish minded man in particular has the sacred duty each in his own denomination of making people stop just talking superficially of god s will and actually fulfill god s will and not let god s word be desecrated orig ital for god s will gave men their form their essence and their abilities anyone who destroys his work is declaring war on the lord s creation the divine will therefore let every man be active each in his own denomination if you please and let every man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his religious community and tries to butt into the other hence today i believe that i am acting in accordance with the will of the almighty creator by defending myself against the jew i am fighting for the work of the lord orig ital adolf hitler from mein kampf trans ralph mannheim of course someone bad believing something does not make that belief wrong it s also entirely possible that hitler was lying when he claimed to believe in god we certainly can t conclude that he s an atheist though subject the bible proves it typical posting in the bible it says that response most of the readers of alt atheism feel that the bible is of questionable accuracy as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were recording oral tradition that existed many years before thus any claimed truth in it is of questionable legitimacy this isn t to say that the bible has no truth in it simply that any truth must be examined before being accepted many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is subject to interpretation any claim that a passage means one thing and one thing only is not legitimate note that this feeling tends to extend to other books it is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion subject pascal s wager typical posting if you believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you have lost nothing but if you don t believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you will go to hell therefore it is foolish to be an atheist response this argument is known as pascal s wager it has several flaws firstly it does not indicate which religion to follow indeed there are many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there this is often described as the avoiding the wrong hell problem if a person is a follower of religion x he may end up in religion y s version of hell secondly the statement that if you believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you have lost nothing is not true suppose you re believing in the wrong god the true god might punish you for your foolishness consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in favour of prayer another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that the two possibilities are equally likely or at least that they are of comparable likelihood if in fact the possibility of there being a god is close to zero the argument becomes much less persuasive so sadly the argument is only likely to convince those who believe already also many feel that for intellectually honest people belief is based on evidence with some amount of intuition it is not a matter of will or cost benefit analysis formally speaking the argument consists of four statements one does not know whether god exists not believing in god is bad for one s eternal soul if god does exist believing in god is of no consequence if god does not exist therefore it is in one s interest to believe in god there are two approaches to the argument the first is to view as an assumption and as a consequence of it one problem with this approach in the abstract is that it creates information from no information this is considered invalid in information theory statement indicates one has no information about god but statement indicates that beneficial information can be gained from the absolute lack of information about god this violates information entropy information has been extracted from no information at no cost the alternative approach is to claim that and are both assumptions the problem with this is that is then basically an assumption which states the christian position and only a christian will agree with that assumption the argument thus collapses to if you are a christian it is in your interests to believe in god a rather vacuous tautology and not the way pascal intended the argument to be viewed the biggest reason why pascal s wager is a failure is that if god is omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as a wager he will spurn the latter assuming he actually cares at all whether people believe in him subject what is occam s razor typical posting people keep talking about occam s razor what is it response william of occam formulated a principle which has become known as occam s razor in its original form it said do not multiply entities unnecessarily that is if you can explain something without supposing the existence of some entity then do so nowadays when people refer to occam s razor they generally express it more generally for example as take the simplest solution the relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations for what we see around us there is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there which came into being as a result of natural processes there is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there and there is also a god who created the universe clearly this god must be of non zero complexity given that both explanations fit the facts occam s razor might suggest that we should take the simpler of the two solution number one unfortunately some argue that there is a third even more simple solution there isn t an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there we just imagine that there is this third option leads us logically towards solipsism which many people find unacceptable subject why it s good to believe in jesus typical posting i want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion response preaching is not appreciated feel free to talk about your religion but please do not write postings that are on a conversion theme such postings do not belong on alt atheism and will be rejected from alt atheism moderated try the newsgroup talk religion misc you would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite newsgroup in an attempt to convert you please do unto others as you would have them do unto you often theists make their basic claims about god in the form of lengthy analogies or parables be aware that atheists have heard of god and know the basic claims about him if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell atheists that god exists and brings salvation you may as well not post it since it tells us nothing we have not been told before subject why i know that god exists typical posting i know from personal experience and prayer that god exists response just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship exists so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not exist that evidence varies from person to person furthermore without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand many people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things that they have been abducted by ufos visited by the ghost of elvis and so on subject einstein and god does not play dice typical posting albert einstein believed in god do you think you re cleverer than him response einstein did once comment that god does not play dice with the universe this quotation is commonly mentioned to show that einstein believed in the christian god used this way it is out of context it refers to einstein s refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory furthermore einstein s religious background was jewish rather than christian a better quotation showing what einstein thought about god is the following i believe in spinoza s god who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists not in a god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings einstein was unable to accept quantum theory because of his belief in an objective orderly reality a reality which would not be subject to random events and which would not be dependent upon the observer he believed that qm was incomplete and that a better theory would have no need for statistical interpretations so far no such better theory has been found and much evidence suggests that it never will be a longer quote from einstein appears in science philosophy and religion a symposium published by the conference on science philosophy and religion in their relation to the democratic way of life inc new york in it he says the more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature for him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an independent cause of natural events to be sure the doctrine of a personal god interfering with natural events could never be refuted italics his in the real sense by science for this doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific knowledge has not yet been able to set foot but i am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal for a doctrine which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark will of necessity lose its effect on mankind with incalculable harm to human progress in their struggle for the ethical good teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal god that is give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests in their labors they will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the good the true and the beautiful in humanity itself this is to be sure a more difficult but an incomparably more worthy task einstein has also said it was of course a lie what you read about my religous convictions a lie which is being systematically repeated i do not believe in a personal god and i have never denied this but have expressed it clearly if something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it the latter quote is from albert einstein the human side edited by helen dukas and banesh hoffman and published by princeton university press also from the same book i do not believe in immortality of the individual and i consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it of course the fact that einstein chose not to believe in christianity does not in itself imply that christianity is false subject everyone worships something typical posting everyone worships something whether it s money power or god response if that is true everyone is a polytheist theists care just as much about those things that atheists care about if the atheists reactions to for example their families amount to worship then so do the theists subject why there must be a causeless cause typical posting sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member so chains of causes must all have a first element a causeless cause response the set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound but has no smallest member further even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause that does not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity and especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by any particular religion subject the universe is so complex it must have been designed typical posting the presence of design in the universe proves there is a god surely you don t think all this appeared here just by chance response this is known as the argument from design it is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the universe those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the newsgroup talk origins for a while there is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here however the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of so called scientific creationism furthermore there is much evidence observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on earth the origin of the argument by design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as say a human is so improbable that surely it can t have come about by chance that surely there must be some external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos deliberately but if human intelligence is so improbable surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely the approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the creationist position this leads us to the familiar theme of if a creator created the universe what created the creator but with the addition of spiralling improbability the only way out is to declare that the creator was not created and just is or was from here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just is without introducing a creator indeed stephen hawking in his book a brief history of time explains his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent with no beginning or end the argument from design is often stated by analogy in the so called watchmaker argument one is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the beach does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker or that it evolved naturally of course one assumes a watchmaker yet like the watch the universe is intricate and complex so the argument goes the universe too must have a creator the watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws over and above those common to all arguments by design firstly a watchmaker creates watches from pre existing materials whereas god is claimed to have created the universe from nothing these two sorts of creation are clearly fundamentally different and the analogy is therefore rather weak secondly a watchmaker makes watches but there are many other things in the world if we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear reactor we wouldn t assume it was created by the watchmaker the argument would therefore suggest a multitude of creators each responsible for a different part of creation finally in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered and therefore stands out from the randomness of nature yet in the second part of the argument we start from the position that the universe is obviously not random but shows elements of order the watchmaker argument is thus internally inconsistent subject independent evidence that the bible is true typical posting the events of the new testament are confirmed by independent documentary evidence for example response the writings of josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary evidence early versions of josephus s work are thought not to have mentioned jesus or james the extant version discusses john in a non christian context many scholars believe that the original mentioned jesus and james in passing but that this was expanded by christian copyists several reconstructions of the original text have been published to this effect much information appears in the ecclesiastical history of eusebius about c e it is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily eusebius who is generally acknowledged as the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity it is eusebius who is generally given the title of authorship for this material aside from the new testament the biographical information about jesus is more well documented for further information please consult the frequently asked questions file for the newsgroup soc religion christian subject godel s incompleteness theorem typical posting godel s incompleteness theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the bible to be both true and complete response godel s first incompleteness theorem says that in any consistent formal system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary arithmetic one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be valid or invalid true or false within that formal system technically speaking the system must also be recursive that is there must be a decision procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal system essentially all such systems can formulate what is known as a liar paradox the classic liar paradox sentence in ordinary english is this sentence is false note that if a proposition is undecidable the formal system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable the logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined so claims that godel s incompleteness theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to prove or disprove the existence of god are worthless in isolation one can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the existence of god simply by having the existence of god stated as an axiom this is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof however it may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms that both atheists and theists agree with it may then be possible to show that godel s incompleteness theorem holds for that system however that would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that god exists within the system furthermore it certainly wouldn t tell us anything about whether it is possible to prove the existence of god generally note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about the actual existence of god the formal systems are just abstractions another frequent claim is that godel s incompleteness theorem demonstrates that a religious text the bible the book of mormon or whatever cannot be both consistent and universally applicable religious texts are not formal systems so such claims are nonsense subject george bush on atheism and patriotism typical posting did george bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens response the following exchange took place at the chicago airport between robert i sherman of american atheist press and george bush on august sherman is a fully accredited reporter and was present by invitation as a member of the press corps the republican presidential nominee was there to announce federal disaster relief for illinois the discussion turned to the presidential primary rs what will you do to win the votes of americans who are atheists gb i guess i m pretty weak in the atheist community faith in god is important to me rs surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of americans who are atheists gb no i don t know that atheists should be considered as citizens nor should they be considered patriots this is one nation under god rs do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation of state and church gb yes i support the separation of church and state i m just not very high on atheists upi reported on may that various atheist organizations were still angry over the remarks the exchange appeared in the boulder daily camera on monday february it can also be found in free enquiry magazine fall issue volume number page on october mr sherman had a confrontation with ed murnane cochairman of the bush quayle illinois campaign this concerned a lawsuit mr sherman had filed to stop the community consolidated school district chicago illinois from forcing his first grade atheist son to pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states as one nation under god bush s phrase the following conversation took place rs american atheists filed the pledge of allegiance lawsuit yesterday does the bush campaign have an official response to this filing em it s bullshit rs what is bullshit em everything that american atheists does rob is bullshit rs thank you for telling me what the official position of the bush campaign is on this issue em you re welcome after bush s election american atheists wrote to bush asking him to retract his statement on february st c boyden gray counsel to the president replied on white house stationery that bush substantively stood by his original statement and wrote as you are aware the president is a religious man who neither supports atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or supported by the government for further information contact american atheist veterans at the american atheist press s cameron road address subject i know where hell is typical posting i know where hell is hell is in norway response there are several towns called hell in various countries around the world including norway and the usa whilst this information is mildly amusing the first time one hears it readers of alt atheism are now getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week subject biblical contradictions wanted typical posting does anyone have a list of biblical contradictions response american atheist press publish an atheist s handbook detailing biblical contradictions see the accompanying posting on atheist resources for details there is a file containing some biblical contradictions available from the archive server mantis co uk see the contacts file for more information subject the usa is a christian nation typical posting because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers shouldn t the united states be considered a christian nation response based upon the writings of several important founding fathers it is clear that they never intended the us to be a christian nation here are some quotes there are many more what influence in fact have ecclesiastical establishments had on society in some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the ruins of the civil authority on many instances they have been seen upholding the thrones of political tyranny in no instance have they been the guardians of the liberties of the people rulers who wish to subvert the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient auxiliaries a just government instituted to secure and perpetuate it needs them not james madison a memorial and remonstrance i almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved the cross consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced john adams in a letter to thomas jefferson history i believe furnishes no example of a priest ridden people maintaining a free civil government this marks the lowest grade of ignorance of which their political as well as religious leaders will always avail themselves for their own purpose thomas jefferson to baron von humboldt i cannot conceive otherwise than that he the infinite father expects or requires no worship or praise from us but that he is even infinitely above it benjamin franklin from articles of belief and acts of religion nov subject the usa is not a christian nation typical posting is it true that george washington said that the united states is not in any sense founded upon the christian religion response no the quotation often given is in fact from article xi of the treaty of tripoli stat treaty series article as the government of the united states of america is not in any sense founded on the christian religion as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws religion or tranquility of musselmen and as the said states never have entered into any war or act of hostility against any mehomitan nation it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries the text may be found in the congressional record or in treaty collections such as charles bevans treaties and other international agreements of the united states of america vol pp the english text of the treaty of tripoli was approved by the u s senate on june and ratified by president john adams on june it was recently discovered that the arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the quotation it lacks article xi altogether the person who translated the arabic to english was joel barlow consul general at algiers a close friend of thomas paine and an opponent of christianity it is possible that barlow made up article xi but since there is no arabic version of that article to be found it s hard to say in a new treaty of tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the quotation end of faq digest
alt atheism faq constructing a logical argument archive name atheism logic alt atheism archive name logic last modified april version constructing a logical argument although there is much argument on usenet the general quality of argument found is poor this article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to logic in the hope of improving the general level of debate logic is the science of reasoning proof thinking or inference concise oed logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not valid or invalid of course one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly nevertheless a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an argument note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable the matter is very much open for debate this document merely explains how to use logic given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job propositions or statements are the building blocks of a logical argument a proposition is a statement which is either true or false for example it is raining or today is tuesday propositions may be either asserted said to be true or denied said to be false note that this is a technical meaning of deny not the everyday meaning the proposition is the meaning of the statement not the particular arrangement of words used to express it so god exists and there exists a god both express the same proposition an argument is to quote the monty python sketch a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition an argument consists of three stages first of all the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated these are called the premises of the argument they are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions premises or assertions are often indicated by phrases such as because since obviously and so on the phrase obviously is often viewed with suspicion as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises if something doesn t seem obvious to you don t be afraid to question it you can always say oh yes you re right it is obvious when you ve heard the explanation next the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as inference in inference one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already accepted there are various forms of valid inference the propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference inference is often denoted by phrases such as implies that or therefore finally we arrive at the conclusion of the argument the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as therefore it follows that we conclude and so on the conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference for example every event has a cause premise the universe has a beginning premise all beginnings involve an event premise this implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event inference therefore the universe has a cause inference and conclusion note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument a proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument the terms do not make sense in isolation sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above for example the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated afterwards in support of the conclusion this is perfectly valid if sometimes a little confusing recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or conclusions many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument some statements look like arguments but are not for example if the bible is accurate jesus must either have been insane an evil liar or the son of god this is not an argument it is a conditional statement it does not assert the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its conclusion it also suffers from a number of other logical flaws but we ll come to those later another example god created you therefore do your duty to god the phrase do your duty to god is not a proposition since it is neither true nor false therefore it is not a conclusion and the sentence is not an argument finally causality is important consider a statement of the form a because b if we re interested in establishing a and b is offered as evidence the statement is an argument if we re trying to establish the truth of b then it is not an argument it is an explanation for example there must be something wrong with the engine of my car because it will not start this is an argument my car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine this is an explanation there are two traditional types of argument deductive and inductive a deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions that is an argument where if the premises are true the conclusion must also be true a deductive argument is either valid or invalid a valid argument is defined as one where if the premises are true then the conclusion is true an inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion inductive arguments are not valid or invalid however we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other arguments and about how probable their premises are there are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor inductive however we will concentrate for the moment on deductive arguments as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing it is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion holds this is because of the slightly counter intuitive nature of implication which we must now consider more carefully obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions however an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions for example all insects have wings premise woodlice are insects premise therefore woodlice have wings conclusion here the conclusion is not true because the argument s premises are false if the argument s premises were true however the conclusion would be true the argument is thus entirely valid more subtly we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises as in all fish live in the sea premise dolphins are fish premise therefore dolphins live in the sea conclusion however the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premises we can therefore draw up a truth table for implication the symbol denotes implication a is the premise b the conclusion t and f represent true and false respectively premise conclusion inference a b a b f f t if the premises are false and the inference f t t valid the conclusion can be true or false t f f if the premises are true and the conclusion false the inference must be invalid t t t if the premises are true and the inference valid the conclusion must be true a sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true a sound argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion be careful not to confuse valid arguments with sound arguments to delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy it is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing an argument these pitfalls are known as fallacies in everyday english the term fallacy is used to refer to mistaken beliefs as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs this is fair enough but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument especially if the argument appears valid or convincing so for the purposes of this discussion we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appears to be correct but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more closely by studying fallacies we aim to avoid being misled by them the following list of fallacies is not intended to be exhaustive argumentum ad baculum appeal to force the appeal to force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion it is often used by politicians and can be summarized as might makes right the force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer for example thus there is ample proof of the truth of the bible all those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in hell argumentum ad hominem argumentum ad hominem is literally argument directed at the man the abusive variety of argumentum ad hominem occurs when instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion the arguer attacks the person or people making the assertion this is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it for example atheism is an evil philosophy it is practised by communists and murderers sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by showing for example that he is a known perjurer this is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness and not argumentum ad hominem however it does not demonstrate that the witness s testimony is false to conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the argumentum ad ignorantiam see elsewhere in this list the circumstantial form of argumentum ad hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent s particular circumstances for example it is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food how can you argue otherwise when you re quite happy to wear leather shoes this is an abusive charge of inconsistency used as an excuse for dismissing the opponent s argument this fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion for example of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing you re white this particular form of argumentum ad hominem when one alleges that one s adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests is also known as poisoning the well argumentum ad ignorantium argumentum ad ignorantium means argument from ignorance this fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved false or equivalently when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved true note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved true a basic scientific principle examples of course the bible is true nobody can prove otherwise of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist nobody has shown any proof that they are real note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty also in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred the absence of such evidence can validly be used to infer that the event did not occur for example a flood as described in the bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth the earth does not have a tenth as much water even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles therefore no such flood occurred in science we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not occurred we cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred however argumentum ad misericordiam this is the appeal to pity also known as special pleading the fallacy is committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a conclusion accepted for example i did not murder my mother and father with an axe please don t find me guilty i m suffering enough through being an orphan argumentum ad populum this is known as appealing to the gallery or appealing to the people to commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people this form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language for example pornography must be banned it is violence against women the bible must be true millions of people know that it is are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fools argumentum ad numeram this fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum it consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition the more likely it is that that proposition is correct argumentum ad verecundiam the appeal to authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion for example isaac newton was a genius and he believed in god this line of argument is not always completely bogus for example reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject for example we can distinguish quite clearly between stephen hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation and john searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent computer hawking is a physicist and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed searle is a linguist so it is questionable whether he is well qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence the fallacy of accident the fallacy of accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose accidental circumstances mean that the rule is inapplicable it is the error made when one goes from the general to the specific for example christians generally dislike atheists you are a christian so you must dislike atheists this fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules converse accident hasty generalization this fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident it occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible cases for example jim bakker was an insincere christian therefore all christians are insincere sweeping generalization dicto simpliciter a sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable a sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty generalization non causa pro causa post hoc ergo propter hoc these are known as false cause fallacies the fallacy of non causa pro causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause for example i took an aspirin and prayed to god and my headache disappeared so god cured me of the headache the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event for example the soviet union collapsed after taking up atheism therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons cum hoc ergo propter hoc this fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc it asserts that because two events occur together they must be causally related and leaves no room for other factors that may be the cause s of the events petitio principii this fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached circulus in demonstrando this fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to reach often the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid argument for example homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret and will be open to blackmail therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government office note that the argument is entirely circular the premise is the same as the conclusion an argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the british secret services official ban on homosexual employees another example is the classic we know that god exists because the bible tells us so and we know that the bible is true because it is the word of god complex question fallacy of interrogation this is the fallacy of presupposition one example is the classic loaded question have you stopped beating your wife the question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked this trick is often used by lawyers in cross examination when they ask questions like where did you hide the money you stole similarly politicians often ask loaded questions such as how long will this ec interference in our affairs be allowed to continue or does the chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization ignoratio elenchi the fallacy of irrelevant conclusion consists of claiming that an argument supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion for example a christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of christianity are undoubtably true if he then argues at length that christianity is of great help to many people no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that christian teachings are true sadly such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable light equivocation equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument for example what could be more affordable than free software but to make sure that it remains free that users can do what they like with it we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable amphiboly amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing accent accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning in this case the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized for example consider we should not speak ill of our friends and we should not speak ill of our friends fallacies of composition one fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the whole for example the bicycle is made entirely of low mass components and is therefore very lightweight the other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those items for example a car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses fallacy of division the fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition like its opposite it exists in two varieties the first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its parts for example you are studying at a rich college therefore you must be rich the other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each item for example ants can destroy a tree therefore this ant can destroy a tree the slippery slope argument this argument states that should one event occur so will other harmful events there is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event for example if we legalize marijuana then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and we ll have a nation full of drug addicts on welfare therefore we cannot legalize marijuana a is based on b fallacies is a type of fallacies these fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar examples isn t history based upon faith if so then isn t the bible also a form of history islam is based on faith christianity is based on faith so isn t islam a form of christianity cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry so aren t dogs a form of cat affirmation of the consequent this fallacy is an argument of the form a implies b b is true therefore a is true to understand why it is a fallacy examine the truth table for implication given earlier denial of the antecedent this fallacy is an argument of the form a implies b a is false therefore b is false again the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a fallacy note that this fallacy is different from non causa pro causa the latter has the form a implies b a is false therefore b is false where a does not in fact imply b at all here the problem is not that the implication is invalid rather it is that the falseness of a does not allow us to deduce anything about b converting a conditional this fallacy is an argument of the form if a then b therefore if b then a argumentum ad antiquitam this is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old or because that s the way it s always been argumentum ad novitam this is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something else argumentum ad crumenam the fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness that those with more money are more likely to be right argumentum ad lazarum the fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is wealthier this fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam argumentum ad nauseam this is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is heard an argumentum ad nauseum is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something bifurcation also referred to as the black and white fallacy bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two alternatives where in fact other alternatives exist or can exist plurium interrogationum many questions this fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex question non sequitur a non sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with it red herring this fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed so that everyone s attention is diverted away from the points being made towards a different conclusion reification hypostatization reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing shifting the burden of proof the burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition shifting the burden of proof a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made the source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise straw man the straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else s position so that it can be attacked more easily then to knock down that misrepresented position then to conclude that the original position has been demolished it is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made the extended analogy the fallacy of the extended analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over the fallacy is to assume that mentioning two different situations in an argument about a general rule constitutes a claim that those situations are analogous to each other this fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about anti cryptography legislation i believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it such a position is odious it implies that you would not have supported martin luther king are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the struggle for black liberation how dare you tu quoque this is the famous you too fallacy it occurs when an action is argued to be acceptable because the other party has performed it for instance you re just being randomly abusive so you ve been abusive too

re amusing atheists and agnostics date apr gmt from bake timmons timmbake mcl ucsb edu these bible lovers have got to chill out if we all could just relax and see atheism for what it is the funny pages could have more material atheism denies the existence of god this is logically bankrupt where is the proof of this nonexistence it s a joke so nobody can take the above sense of atheism seriously perhaps perhaps because you just made it up now put your skateboard away and read the faq learn something about atheism before you get off on these tangents
re so help you god in court i don t think there is really any question about which god the courts mean the request for solemnly swearing so help you god is always made after a request to pick up the bible in your left hand and hold up your right hand in the courts of nc at least it is always an old and new testament though it is hard to imagine picking up the bible and swearing to whatever god is sometimes the least of the religious influence there is a court in greensboro nc where the judge routinely has everyone in the courtroom stand to join him in prayer at the beginning of every session i ve thought about sitting through it but i m not terribly anxious to spend days in jail

re amusing atheists and agnostics timmbake mcl ucsb edu bake timmons writes atheism denies the existence of god this is logically bankrupt where is the proof of this nonexistence it s a joke this is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism i e the belief that you can t deny anything that you can t prove doesn t exist this is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are conceivable but not observed to exist does this mean that we would have to believe in all of them according to the above poster we must believe in objects or beings that haven t been proved not to exist so why stop at god there could be a huge number of beings identical to ronald reagan except for trivial differences say one is missing a finger one has blond hair and they all live on other planets so we can t see them the reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of god fine but why do these people shoot themselves in the foot and mock the idea of a god here again is a classic atheist fallacy how did they shoot themselves in the foot radical muslims the crusades the inquisition are common examples that atheists like to bring up as marks against religion how weak only fools can take that drivel seriously how about the grand daddy of all human atrocities the stalinist movement twenty eight million people killed under this leadership which proudly featured atheism there is a big difference here stalin didn t say that he stood for a particular moral position i e against murder and terrorism etc and then did the opposite like the religious movements he was at least an honest killer this is not a support of stalin but an attack on this viewpoint saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic look at all the russians that helped stalin that weren t atheists don t they contradict your point besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant to his murdering people this is just the common assumption that atheists can t value life as much as theists which you didn t support agnostics are not as funny because they are more reasonable yet they do in some sense seem funny because they believe that the existence of god is unknowable this in itself is every bit the assumption that atheism is though it s less arrogant and pompous ah and here s another point you didn t get out of the faq an atheist doesn t have to hold the positive view that god doesn t exist he she may just have the non existence of the positive belief here s the example strong atheism i believe god does not exist a positive belief weak atheism i don t believe in a god a negative belief these are not the same some one that has never thought of the idea of god in their whole life is technically an atheist but not the kind that you are calling unreasonable or let s look at it this way in sets suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that i will represent as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas exist as real objects or not so if s santa then e s no is the person not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa but notice that even e s no is itself another idea this means you have lots of cases christian a e a yes b e b no g e g yes where g god atheist strong a e a g e g no atheist weak a e i e no g at all in the set agnostic a g e g indeterminate e why are people so afraid to say undecided it must just be another feature of human nature undecided is not a sexy trendy or glamorous word it does not inspire much hate or conflict it s not blasphemous it s not political in fact it is too often taken to mean unsophisticated nietzsche once said that a man would rather will nonexistence than not will at all but the darwinist way to put this is that humanity always prefers no or yes to a maybe because indecision is not a useful survival trait evolution has drilled it in us to take positions even false ones bake timmons iii m s

re is morality constant was re biblical rape bill conner bil okcforum osrhe edu wrote there are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread that are a little confusing an atheist is one for whom all things can be understood as processes of nature exclusively this definition does not include all atheists see the faq however i for one do think there is no need to invoke any divine or spiritual explanations it makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood as natural processes and to claim that our observations do not require us to postulate any divine intervention or anything spiritual for that matter humans are not omnipotent and neither is science however science has one advantage theology doesn t it is self correcting with nature as its judge it is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self consistent simple picture of our universe science is no longer a bunch of separate branches it is one from particle physics to psychology and no aspect of our life or our universe is safe from its stern and stony eye not even our consciousness there is no need for any recourse to divnity to describe or explain anything there is no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by physics chemistry biology etc everything is random nothing is determnined actually determinism vs indeterminism is a philosophical question and science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow superdeterministic or not i think the question does not have any meaning as far as individual human beings go if their apparent free will is an illusion it does not appear to be so from their perspective bill can you say for sure whether you have a free will or not this would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its products there is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence it s just a happy accident maybe who are we to tell it seems intelligence is useful when during the history of earth has one species been able to control one third of the whole biosphere this can still be a result of numerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates and preserves even that machinery can be result of the same principle only the systems that can start replicating will survive those which don t don t make it recommended reading t o for an atheist no event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense and no thought about an event can have value from whose perspective i value events and things subjectively from my perspective nature does not have values because it does not have a perspective values arise from awareness if i have a subjective perspective it is easy to assume that other people also do and if i think about what it would it be like in their position i will eventually discover the golden rule morality is not necessarily a gift from heavens in fact it may be a product of evolution perhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity is helpful allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect others who seem to have identity too bill have you ever read aristotle try his ethica nikomakhea sp for starters how then can an atheist judge value what is the basis for criticizing the values ennumerated in the bible or the purposes imputed to god on what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned it seems that in judging the values that motivate others to action you have to have some standard against which conduct is measured but what in nature can serve that purpose what law of nature can you invoke to establish your values c s lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why he abandoned his atheism and became christian the argument is severely flawed some values such as the golden rule can have a rational basis some others like the basic idea of wanting to live has probably its roots in the way our brains are wired lewis ignored the very real possiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic behaviour and morality as well indeed as humans evolved better and better in building and using tools they also became better at killing each other it is a logical necessity that evolution could only favour those who knew how to use tools but not against one s own people the bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early jews was not beyond this a simple set of rules to hold the people together under one god their god did not care much about people of other nations at the time of the nt things were quite different the jews were under rule of an empire and could no longer simply ignore the gentiles a new situation required a new morality and along with it a new religion was born a mutation in a meme pool since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event what difference could it possibly make what anyone does religious or otherwise there can be no meaning or gradation of value the only way an atheist can object to any behaviour is to admit that the objection is entirely subjective and that he she just doesn t like it that s it any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries no weight in any absolute sense it looks like you haven t bothered to read philosophy whenever there is an observer there is a subjective point of view which may value its existence and happiness even if that were just a result of some physical event and other s happiness too if the observer comes to think about it in an absolutely objective sense that is without any observers or subjects moral judgments lose their meaning it is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of view this includes gods too their values are only their personal judgments not absolute truths since such truths do not exist the fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others is a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence by becoming social beings who can think and value others existence morality is not property of humans alone chimps dolphins and many other species show great care for each other dolphins have sometimes saved humans from drowning a good deed indeed that you don t like what god told people to do says nothing about god or god s commands it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with a pre existing thought set to form that reaction that your objections seem well founded is due to the way you ve been conditioned there is no truth content the whole of your intellectual landscape is an illusion a virtual reality the last statement does not logically follow in fact there is every reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very well and our senses can convey reliable information solipsism is still a logical possibility but not a very likely one you are continuously mixing two different views the subjective point of view which we all share and an objective point of view which does not exist any observer or thinker any personal being has its own point of view it does not matter whether this point of view is a result of some physical events or not it does not cease to be subjective from a non observers non point of view values do not exist neither does pain or pleasure or beauty or love such things are inherently subjective once again if god wants wives to submit to their husbands or even to make a leap of faith into the unknown or wants to punish us if we don t i disagree with his morals i do not think my morals come from any supreme being to remove my morals means the same than to make me a zombie a machine without a single thought if god gave us morality to judge but i disagree with him it is not my fault he is free to replace my morals i cannot see what is the point of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one s own and then to get mad at this god must be schizophrenic all of this being so you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values right wrong goood evil etc and cannot participate your opinion about the bible can have no weight whatsoever neither can the opinion of any god for that matter i cannot understand why a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way less credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else bill take note absolute values must be independent of any being including gods if god has a subjective viewpoint it is his own point of view and his morals

re the inimitable rushdie re an anecdote about islam in article apr monu cc monash edu au darice yoyo cc monash edu au fred rice writes in article c c cn gb ra nrl navy mil khan itd itd nrl navy mil umar khan writes i just borrowed a book from the library on khomeini s fatwa etc i found this useful passage regarding the legitimacy of the fatwa it was also common knowledge as prescribed by islamic law that the sentence was only applicable where the jurisdiction of islamic law applies moreover the sentence has to be passed by an islamic court and executed by the state machinery through the due process of the law even in islamic countries let alone in non muslim lands individuals cannot take the law into their own hands the sentence when passed must be carried out by the state through the usual machinery and not by individuals indeed it becomes a criminal act to take the law into one s own hands and punish the offender unless it is in the process of self defence moreover the offender must be brought to the notice of the court and it is the court who shoud decide how to deal with him this law applies equally to muslim as well as non muslim territories i agree fully with the above statement and is precisely what i meant by my previous statements about islam not being anarchist and the law not being enforcible despite the law being applicable hence on such clarification from the ulama islamic scholars muslims in britain before and after imam khomeini s fatwa made it very clear that since islamic law is not applicable to britain the hadd compulsory punishment cannot be applied here i disagree with this conclusion about the applicability of the islamic law to all muslims wherever they may be the above conclusion does not strictly follow from the foregoing but only the conclusion that the fatwa cannot be enforced according to islamic law however i do agree that the punishment cannot be applied to rushdie even were it well founded wow from the above it looks like that from an islamic viewpoint khomeini s fatwa constitutes a criminal act perhaps i could even go out on a limb and call khomeini a criminal on this basis certainly putting a price on the head of rushdie in britain is a criminal act according to islamic law anyhow i think it is understood by knowledgeable muslims that khomeini s fatwa is islamically illegitimate at least on the basis expounded above others such as myself and others who have posted here particularly umar khan and gregg jaeger i think go further and say that even the punishment constituted in the fatwa is against islamic law according to our understanding yes gregg
re yet more rushdie re islamic law in article apr monu cc monash edu au darice yoyo cc monash edu au fred rice wrote it is my understanding that it is generally agreed upon by the ulema islamic scholars that islamic law applies only in an islamic country of which the uk is not furthermore to take the law into one s own hands is a criminal act as these are matters for the state not for individuals nevertheless khomeini offered a cash prize for people to take the law into their own hands something which to my understanding is against islamic law yes this is also my understanding of the majority of islamic laws however i believe there are also certain legal rulings which in all five schools of law sunni and jaffari can be levelled against muslim or non muslims both within and outside dar al islam i do not know if apostasy when accompanied by active persistent and open hostility to islam falls into this category of the law i do know that historically apostasy has very rarely been punished at all let alone by the death penalty my understanding is that khomeini s ruling was not based on the law of apostasy alone it was well known that rushdie was an apostate long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no precedent in the qur an hadith or in islamic history for indiscriminantly levelling death penalties for apostasy i believe the charge levelled against rushdie was that of fasad this ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals the reward was not offered by khomeini but by individuals within iran stuff deleted also i think you are muddying the issue as you seem to assume that khomeini s fatwa was issued due to the distribution of the book my understanding is that khomeini s fatwa was issued in response to the writing and publishing of the book if my view is correct then your viewpoint that rushdie was sentenced for a crime in progress is incorrect i would concur that the thrust of the fatwa from what i remember was levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication of the book however the charge of fasad can encompass a number of lesser charges i remember that when diplomatic relations broke off between britain and iran over the fatwa iran stressed that the condemnation of the author and the removal of the book from circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the crisis but you are correct to point out that banning the book was not the main thrust behind the fatwa islamic charges such as fasad are levelled at people not books the rushdie situation was followed in iran for several months before the issuance of the fatwa rushdie went on a media blitz presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost his image and push the book he was everywhere in the media then muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while protesting against the book rushdie appeared momentarily concerned then climbed back on his media horse to once again attack the muslims and defend his sacred rights it was at this point that the fatwa on fasad was issued the fatwa was levelled at the person of rushdie any actions of rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling the book remains in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers the fatwa against the person of rushdie encompasses his actions as well the crime was certainly a crime in progress at many levels and was being played out and played up in the the full view of the media p s i m not sure about this but i think the charge of shatim also applies to rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella of the fasad ruling

re political atheists kcochran nyx cs du edu keith justified and ancient cochran writes i think that you are confusing the words objective and inherent and objective system is simply one in which an outside observer who given the postulates of the system could perfectly judge any situation or action as consistent with the system right or not wrong you seem to be objecting because the goals of the system are not inherent that is you seem to want to define an objective system as one in which the postulates themselves could be determined by some outside observer i don t think that this is a good definition of an objective system then you need to learn english really gravity is an objective system anybody can learn what it is and perform experiments they will get the same results as every other person who has performed those experiments no gravity is an inherent system you don t need any excess information other than observations to determine anything it is possible to objectively determine someone s guilt or innocence within an non inherent system i agree that morality is not necessarily inherent unless you state that everything we do has an evolutionary basis but this does not mean that it cannot be objective in theory this natural morality is not an objective system as evidenced by your comments about lions and mine perhaps it can be objective but not inherent anyway as i noted before the practices related to mating rituals etc among the animals are likely the only ones to be considered immoral under the previous definitions of the natural law therefore some revisions are in order since the class of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems and in fact the only way that the postulates could be determined by an outsider would be if there were some sort of higher truth like some sort of god or something but i do not think that a god is necessary for an objective system while it seems that you do what are you trying to say here it seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective system because perhaps you think that it would imply inherence which would necessitate some sort of grand design no i have classified behavior of most animals as in line with a moral system it is certainly possible for animals to commit acts which are outside of their rules of ethics but they don t seem to do so very often perhaps they are not intelligent enough to be immoral and perhaps it s because you have yet to define a moral system i think i have it is a code of ethics which basically defines undesired behaviors etc an immoral behavior could be unwanted unproductive or destructive etc depending on the goal of the system that is immoral to what end keith

re islamic genocide o k so pick former yugoslavia instead and say their problems are caused by communism it doesn t really matter but i guess religious leaders are calling for an end to that too so it can t be religiously motivated this despite the fact that the christians carve crosses in dead muslims chests maybe they just want land maybe its something else they want maybe the cross carvings are just accidental i don t know just looks suspicious most likely the tragic situation in bosnia is a combination of ethnical and religious motives where religion is just one attribute that separates the groups from each other but i must agree that the sad saga in bosnia is a terrible example of a case where religion is not helping instead it is used as a weapon against other humans and my sympathies are mostly on the bosnian side it looks like the serbs are the oppressors willing to use even christianity as a weapon against their former friends cheers kent sandvik newton apple com alink ksand private activities on the net
re death penalty was re political atheists the death penalty was conceived as a deterrent to crime but the legal shenanigans that have been added automatic appeals lengthy court battles etc have relegated that purpose to a very small part of what it should be hence the question is do we instate the death penalty as it was meant to be and see if that deters crime or do we get rid of it entirely i doubt the death penalty was supposed to be a deterrent to crime if so why doesn t every crime carry a death penalty that would be effictive wouldn t it the death penalty is a punishment much like a fine for speeding is a punishment anyway somebody with murder on the mind doesn t much care about the consequences i think another problem is that people dont think they will get caught if i wanted to kill another person i wouldn t care what the penalty was if i didn t think i would get caught if it was to be strictly a deterrent it should have been more along the lines of torture dave fuller dfuller portal hq videocart com

why the bible one thing i think is interesting about alt athiesm is the fact that without bible thumpers and their ilk this would be a much duller newsgroup it almost needs the deluded masses to write silly things for athiests to tear apart oh well that little tidbit aside here is what i really wanted write about how can anyone believe in such a sorry document as the bible if you want to be religious aren t there more plausable books out there seriously the bible was written by multiple authors who repeatedly contradict each other one minute it tells you to kill your kid if he talks back and the next it says not to kill at all i think that if xtians really want to follow a deity they should pick one that can be consistent unlike the last one they invented for people who say jesus was the son of god didn t god say not to ever put anyone else before him looks like you did just that didn t god say not to make any symbols or idols what are crosses then don t you think that if you do in fact believe in the bible that you are rather far off track was jesus illiterate why didn t he write anything anyone know i honestly hope that people who believe in the bible understand that it is just one of the religious texts out there and that it is one of the poorer quality ones to boot the only reason xtianity escaped the middle east is because a certain roman who s wine was poisoned with lead made all of rome xtian after a bad dream if this posting keeps one person just one person from standing on a streetcorner and telling people they are going to hell i will be happy only hatred and snap judgements can guide your robots through life dr clayton forester mad scientist

re islam and scientific predictions was re genocide is caused by atheism in cindy apr solan solan unit no cindy solan solan unit no cynthia kandolf writes various quotes deleted in the interest of saving a little bit of bandwidth but i will copy the koran quote and it is he god almighty who created the night and the day and the sun and the earth all the celetial bodies swim along each in its rounded course holy quran as it has been pointed out this quote makes no claim about what orbits what the idea that something orbited something had been held as true for many years before the koran was written so the fact that it says something orbits something is hardly surprising insight my concern is with the word rounded there are two interpretations of this word it means in a circle this is wrong although many believed it to be true at the time the koran was written in other words it is not describing our neighborhood of the universe as it really exists but as it was thought to be at the time this has implications which i hope are obvious to everyone it means in a rounded shape which could include elipses the geometrical form which most nearly describes the orbits of the planets this is also not a great insight look at the shapes you see in nature very few of them even approach a square or rectangle those are human created shapes everything in nature is rounded to some degree even the flat earthers don t try to claim earth is a rectangle children who draw imaginary animals seldom give them rectangular bodies we seem to instinctively recognize that nature produces rounded shapes hence the assumption that the orbits of the planets would be round hardly takes divine inspiration it is good to remember that every translation is to some extent an interpretation so as you point out below one must really go back to the original arabic regarding the verses relevant to nature i prefer to use dr maurice bucaille s translations in his book the bible the qur an and science for in general his translations are more literal maurice bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressing as each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motion also note that the celestial bodies in the first translation quoted by you above is the translator s interpolation it is not existent in the original arabic which is why it is included in brackets perhaps someone who can read the original arabic can eliminate one of these interpretations at any rate neither one of them is exactly impressive you re right what the verses do contain isn t all that remarkable however dr bucaille a surgeon that s how he s a dr thinks it is significant that the above verse contains no geocentric ideas even though geocentrism was all the rage up until the th century or so and this goes for the rest of the qur an as well which has about verses or so regarding nature i think i remember reading once fred rice darice yoyo cc monash edu au

re death penalty gulf war in article f rusnews w w mantis co uk mathew mathew mantis co uk writes jbrown batman bmd trw com writes in article e rusnews w w mantis co uk mathew mathew mantis co uk writes yes fortunately we have right thinking folks like your good self in power and it was therefore deemed acceptable to slaughter tens or even hundreds o thousands of iraqis in order to liberate oil h h hkuwait we won the war hurrah hurrah the number of civilian iraqi deaths were way over exaggerated and exploited for anti war emotionalism by the liberal news media the facts are that less iraqis died in the gulf war than did civilians in any other war of comparable size this century let s analyze this claim a little how is the size of a war defined by number of participants geographical area number of countries involved number of casualties size of armies duration numbers of casualties both absolute and as a percentage of those involved geographical area and numbers of countries too are all measures of size in this case i d say the relevant statistic would be the number of combatants total troops compared to total casualties from among the total civilian population in the affected geographical area which other comparable wars are we talking about vietnam and korea might make good comparisons which liberal news media are we talking about western news in general but in particular the american mass media cbs nbc abc etc the general tone of the news during the whole war was one of those poor poor iraqis along with look how precisely this cruise missile blew this building to bits this was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques which were technically possible only recently i suspect that medical advances may have something to do with it too i agree how about all the innocent people who died in blanket bombing in ww i don t hear you bemoaning them perhaps because the topic hasn t cropped up if you want my opinion i think that the blanket bombing of german cities at the end of world war two was the most appalling act of wholesale slaughter this country has committed in centuries bomber harris was no hero of mine perhaps so and maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake too but that s easy to say from our enlightened viewpoint here in the s right back then it was all out war and germany and japan had to be squashed after all a million or more british had already died hundreds of thousands of french a couple hundread thousand or so americans and millions of russians not to mention a few million jews poles and other people of slavic descent in german concentration camps all things considered the fire bombings and the atomic bomb were essential and therefore justified in bringing the war to a quick end to avoid even greater allied losses i for one don t regret it war is never an exact science but with smart bombs it s becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian casualties sometimes mistakes are made targets are misidentified innocents die that s war the way it really is entrenched political rulers operating in their own selfish interests without regard for the lives of other people that is the way war really is sure and it s the people who suffer because of them all the more reason to depose these entrenched political rulers operating in their own selfish interests or do you mean that this applies to the allies as well why all the fuss about kuwait and not east timor bosnia or even tibet if iraq is so bad why were we still selling them stuff a couple of weeks before we started bombing i make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the west before the war it is evident that the west especially america misjudged hussein drastically but once hussein invaded kuwait and threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world s oil supply he had to be stopped sure the war could have been prevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the west before hussein invaded kuwait but it is still hussein who is responsible for his decision to invade and once he did so a strong response from the west was required mathew your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off base here you come off sounding like a complete peace nik idiot although i feel sure that was not your intent what s your intent to sound like a loving christian well you aren t doing a very good job of it well it s not very loving to allow a hussein or a hitler to gobble up nearby countries and keep them or to allow them to continue with mass slaughter of certain peoples under their dominion so i d have to say yes stopping hussein was the most loving thing to do for the most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest so the iraqi war was wrong eh i m sure that appeasement would have worked better than war just like it did in ww eh who even mentioned appeasement and what makes you think the situation is even remotely analogous to world war two i mentioned it if we hadn t intervened allowing hussein to keep kuwait then it would have been appeasement it is precisely the lessons the world learned in ww that motivated the western alliance to war letting hitler take austria and czechoslavkia did not stop ww from happening and letting hussein keep kuwait would not have stopped an eventual gulf war to protect saudi arabia i guess we shouldn t have fought ww either just think of all those innocent german civilians killed in dresden and hamburg yes do germans are human too you know sure what was truly unfortunate was that they followed hitler in his grandiose quest for a thousand year reich the consequences stemmed from that tyrants like hussein have to be stopped his kind don t understand diplomacy they only understand the point of a gun my only regret is that bush wimped out and didn t have the military roll into baghdad so now hussein is still in power and the iraqi people s sacrifice not to mention the americans who died was for naught i look forward to hearing your incisive comments about east timor and tibet what should i say about them anything in particular and as for poor poor rodney king did you ever stop and think why the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty yes amongst the things i thought were hmm there s an awful lot of white people in that jury so it was the policemen on trial not rodney king and under american law they deserved a jury of their peers if there had been black officers involved i m sure their would have been black jurors too this point of allegedly racial motivations is really shallow those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape but the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and i have not seen when i see a bunch of policemen beating someone who s lying defenceless on the ground it s rather hard to imagine what this other evidence might have been so it s hard to imagine so when has argument from incredulity gained acceptance from the revered author of constructing a logical argument can we expect another revision soon just kidding if there is some wonderful evidence why is it seemingly being kept secret why not tell everyone what it is then everyone could say oh yes you re right king deserved a good beating and we could all live happily ever after i have to admit that i wonder this too but neither the prosecution nor the defense is talking so one cannot conclude either way due to the silence of the principals law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused whether they be criminals or cops one is not found guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of one s guilt and only the jury is in a position to assess the evidence and render a verdict fine but i m still finding it hard to imagine what the reasonable doubt was in this case i mean the cops certainly seem to be beating someone who s lying defenceless on the ground what s your explanation mass hallucination orbital mind control lasers faked video footage do tell ok it certainly seemed to me that there was excessive force involved and frankly the original not guilty verdict baffled me too but then i learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict on a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably would have won they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated assault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm a charge which news commentators said was akin to attempted murder under california law based on what the prosecution was asking for it s evident that the first jury decided that the officers were not guilty note not not guilty of doing wrong but not guilty of aggravated assault with the intent of inflicting serious bodily harm the seeds of the prosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a verdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could if the facts as the news commentators presented them are true then i feel the not guilty verdict was a reasonable one mathew thou shalt not kill unless thou hast a pretty good reason for killing in which case thou shalt kill and also kill anyone who gets in the way as unfortunately it cannot be helped jim brown bible for loving christians thanks mathew i like the quote pretty funny actually i m a monty python fan you know kind of seems in that vein of course oversimplifying any moral argument can make it seem contradictory but then you know that already regards jim

re free moral agency in article c pxqs lm darkside osrhe uoknor edu bil okcforum osrhe edu bill conner says dean kaflowitz decay cbnewsj cb att com wrote now what i am interested in is the original notion you were discussing on moral free agency that is how can a god punish a person for not believing in him when that person is only following his or her nature and it is not possible for that person to deny what his or her reason tells him or her which is that there is no god i think you re letting atheist mythology confuse you on the issue of webster myth a traditional or legendary story a belief whose truth is accepted uncritically how does that qualify indeed it s almost oxymoronic a rather amusing instance i ve found that most atheists hold almost no atheist views as accepted uncritically especially the few that are legend many are trying to explain basic truths as myths do but they don t meet the other criterions also divine justice according to the most fundamental doctrines of christianity when the first man sinned he was at that time the you accuse him of referencing mythology then you procede to launch your own xtian mythology this time meeting all the requirements of myth salvation the idea of punishment is based on the proposition that everyone knows instinctively that god exists is their creator and ah but not everyone knows that god exists so you have a fallacy there s nothing terribly difficult in all this and is well known to any reasonably biblically literate christian the only controversy is and that makes it true holding with the bible rules out controversy read the faq if you ve read it you missed something so re read not a bad suggestion for anyone i re read it just before this with those who pretend not to know what is being said and what it means when atheists claim that they do not know if god exists and don t know what he wants they contradict the bible which clearly says that everyone knows the authority of the bible is its claim to be should i repeat what i wrote above for the sake of getting it across you may trust the bible but your trusting it doesn t make it any more credible to me if the bible says that everyone knows that s clearly reason to doubt the bible because not everyone knows your alleged god s alleged existance refuted while the species wide condemnation is justified those that claim that there is no evidence for the existence of god or that his will is unknown must deliberately ignore the bible the ignorance itself is no excuse no they don t have to ignore the bible the bible is far from universally accepted the bible is not a proof of god it is only a proof that some people have thought that there was a god or does it prove even that they might have been writing it as series of fiction short stories as in the case of dionetics assuming the writers believed it the only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it and that s ignoring the problem of whether or not all the interpretations and biblical philosophers were correct there are people who have truly never heard of the bible again read the faq freedom you are free to ignore god in the same way you are free to ignore gravity and the consequences are inevitable and well known in both cases that an atheist can t accept the evidence means only bzzt wrong answer gravity is directly there it doesn t stop exerting a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it god on the other hand doesn t generally show up in the supermarket except on the tabloids god doesn t exert a rationally undeniable influence gravity is obvious gods aren t secondly human reason is very comforatble with the concept of god so much so that it is in itself intrinsic to our nature human reason always comes back to the question of god in every generation and in no human reason hasn t always come back to the existance of god it has usually come back to the existance of god in other words it doesn t generally come back to the xtian god it comes back to whether there is any god and in much of oriental philosophic history it generally doesn t pop up as the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces are and which ones are out there from a world wide view human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to be and or what force s are currently in control a natural tendancy to believe in god only exists in religious wishful thinking i said all this to make the point that christianity is eminently reasonable that divine justice is just and human nature is much different than what atheists think it is whether you agree or not xtianity is no more reasonable than most other religions and it s reasonableness certainly doesn t merit eminence divine justice well it only seems just to those who already believe in the divinity first not all atheists believe the same things about human nature second whether most atheists are correct or not you certainly are not correct on human nature you are at the least basing your views on a completely eurocentric approach try looking at the outside world as well when you attempt to sum up all of humanity andrew

re death penalty gulf war long in article x rusnews w w mantis co uk mathew mathew mantis co uk writes jbrown batman bmd trw com writes in article f rusnews w w mantis co uk mathew mathew mantis co uk writes which liberal news media are we talking about western news in general but in particular the american mass media cbs nbc abc etc the general tone of the news during the whole war was one of those poor poor iraqis along with look how precisely this cruise missile blew this building to bits most odd over here there was very little about the suffering of the iraqi civilians until towards the end of the war and then it was confined to the few remaining quality newspapers true at first the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos the military was using not to mention the taped video transmissions from the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets but later and especially after the bunker full of civilians was hit they changed their tone it seemed to me that they didn t have the stomach for the reality of war that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare it s like they were only pro gulf war as long as it was nice and clean smart missiles dropping in on military hqs but not when pictures of dead dying and maimed civilians started cropping up what naive hypocrites how about all the innocent people who died in blanket bombing in ww i don t hear you bemoaning them discussion about blanket bombing and a bombs deleted all things considered the fire bombings and the atomic bomb were essential and therefore justified in bringing the war to a quick end to avoid even greater allied losses i should have said here militarily justified it seems from your comments below that you understood this as meaning morally justified i apologize what about the evidence that america knew japan was about to surrender after hiroshima but before nagasaki is that another lie peddled by the liberal media conspiracy i have often wondered about this i ve always thought that the first bomb should have been dropped on japan s island fortress of truk a good inpenatrable military target the second bomb could ve been held back for use on an industrial center if need be but i digress yes i have heard that we found evidence after the war btw that japan was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb unfortunately the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the us s ulimatum therefore the second bomb was dropped most unfortunate imo i for one don t regret it nuke a jap for jesus i don t regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people but i do regret the circumstances which make those decisions necessary and i regret the suffering caused by those decisions why all the fuss about kuwait and not east timor bosnia or even tibet if iraq is so bad why were we still selling them stuff a couple of weeks before we started bombing i make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the west before the war it is evident that the west especially america misjudged hussein drastically but once hussein invaded kuwait and threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world s oil supply he had to be stopped oh i see so we can overlook his using chemical weapons on thousands of people but if he threatens your right to drive a huge gas guzzling car well the man s gotta go actually it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted us and allied action if some back water country took over some other back water country we probably wouldn t intervene not that we don t care but we can t be the world s policman or if a coup had occured in kuwait instead of an invasion then we still wouldn t have acted because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to saudi arabia but the combination of the two an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant and the potential danger to the west s oil interests caused us to take action i ve moved a paragraph from here to later on if we hadn t intervened allowing hussein to keep kuwait then it would have been appeasement right but did you ever hear anyone advocate such a course of action or are you just setting up a strawman i m not setting up a strawman at all if you want to argue against the war then the only logical alternative was to allow hussein to keep kuwait diplomatic alternatives including sanctions were ineffective i guess we shouldn t have fought ww either just think of all those innocent german civilians killed in dresden and hamburg yes do germans are human too you know sure what was truly unfortunate was that they followed hitler in his grandiose quest for a thousand year reich the consequences stemmed from that translation they were asking for it well in a sense yes they probably had no idea of what end hitler would lead their nation to but what about those who didn t support hitler s dreams of conquest it s not as if they democratically voted for all his policies the nsdap got in the elections of and that was the last chance the german people got to vote on the matter they suffered along with the rest why does this bother you so much the world is full of evil and circumstances are not perfect many innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others it it regretable but that s the way it is there are no perfect solutions i look forward to hearing your incisive comments about east timor and tibet what should i say about them anything in particular the people of east timor are still being killed by a dictatorship that invaded their country hell even western journalists have been killed all this was happening before the gulf war why didn t we send in the bombers to east timor why aren t we sending in the bombers now probably because we re not the saviors of the world we can t police each and every country that decides to self destruct or invade another nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to tibet east timor or some other places here s that paragraph i moved what s your intent to sound like a loving christian well you aren t doing a very good job of it well it s not very loving to allow a hussein or a hitler to gobble up nearby countries and keep them or to allow them to continue with mass slaughter of certain peoples under their dominion so i d have to say yes stopping hussein was the most loving thing to do for the most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest the chinese government has a policy of mandatory abortion and sterilization of tibetans tibetan people are rounded up tortured and executed amnesty international recently reported that torture is still widespread in china why aren t we stopping them in fact why are we actively sucking up to them by trading freely with them tell me how we could stop them and i ll support it i for one do not agree with the present us policy of sucking up to them as you put it i agree that it is deplorable and as for poor poor rodney king did you ever stop and think why the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty yes amongst the things i thought were hmm there s an awful lot of white people in that jury so it was the policemen on trial not rodney king erm surely it s irrelevant who s on trial juries are supposed to represent a cross section of the population are they or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale where the trial is held normally this is where the crime is committed unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue is in order i m not an expert on california law or even us law but it seems that this is the way the system is set up you can criticize the system but let s not have unfounded allegations of racial prejudice thrown around and under american law they deserved a jury of their peers you are saying that black people are not the peers of white people no not at all the point is that the fact that there were no blacks on the first jury and that rodney king is black is totally irrelevant this point of allegedly racial motivations is really shallow this idea of people only being tried before a jury of people just like them is really stupid should the nuremburg trials have had a jury entirely made up of nazis germans perhaps peers doesn t mean those who do the same thing like having murderers judge murderers it means having people from the same station in life presumably because they are in a better position to understand the defendent s motivation s those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape but the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and i have not seen when i see a bunch of policemen beating someone who s lying defenceless on the ground it s rather hard to imagine what this other evidence might have been so it s hard to imagine so when has argument from incredulity gained acceptance from the revered author of constructing a logical argument we re not talking about a logical argument we re talking about a court of law as the faq points out some fallacious arguments are not viewed as fallacies in a court of law ok granted however you are using this reasoning as part of your logical argument in this discussion this is not a court of law if the facts as the news commentators presented them are true then i feel the not guilty verdict was a reasonable one were you not talking earlier about the bias of the liberal media conspiracy the media is not totally monolithic even though there is a prevailing liberal bias programs such as the macneil lehrer news hour try to give a balanced and fair reporting of the news there are even conservative sources out there if you know where to look hurrah for rush btw i never used the word conspiracy i don t accept without far more evidence theories that there is some all pervading liberal conspiracy attempting to take over all news sources thou shalt not kill unless thou hast a pretty good reason for killing in which case thou shalt kill and also kill anyone who gets in the way as unfortunately it cannot be helped jim brown bible for loving christians thanks mathew i like the quote pretty funny actually i m a monty python fan you know kind of seems in that vein of course oversimplifying any moral argument can make it seem contradictory but then you know that already ha ha only serious i an atheist am arguing against killing innocent people you a supposed christian are arguing that it s ok to kill innocent people so long as you get some guilty ones as well hardly i didn t say that it s a good thing tm to kill innocent people if the end is just unfortunately we don t live in a perfect world and there are no perfect solutions if one is going to resist tyranny then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die i didn t say it is ok it is unfortunate but sometimes necessary i a moral relativist am arguing that saturation bombing of german cities at the end of world war ii was as far as i can see an evil and unnecessary act i would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain and suffering i m not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say that conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved and perhaps it was unnecessary as let s say we now know that doesn t mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn t see it as being necessary rarely can one have full known of the consequences of an action before making a decision at the time it may have seemed necessary enough to go ahead with it but don t assume that i feel the bombing was morally justified i don t i just don t condemn those who had to make a difficult decision under difficult circumstances you having criticised moral relativism in the past are now arguing that i am in no position to judge the morality of allied actions at the end of the war you certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist i as an absolutist am in a position to judge but i defer judgment you are arguing that the actions need to be assessed in the particular context of the time and that they might have been moral then but not moral now wrong they were neither moral then nor now they seemed necessary to those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war i simply refuse to condemn them for their decision where s your christian love where s your absolute morality oh how quick you are to discard them when it suits you as ivan stang would say jesus would puke one day i will stand before jesus and give account of every word and action even this discourse in this forum i understand the full ramifications of that and i am prepared to do so i don t believe that you can make the same claim mathew and btw the reason i brought up the blanket bombing in germany was because you were bemoaning the iraqi civilian casualties as being so deplorable yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasn t accurate enough to hit industrial military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time but in the gulf war precision bombing was the norm so the point was why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted in spite of precision bombing when so many more civilians proportionately and quantitatively died under the blanket bombing in ww even with precision bombing mistakes happen and some civilians suffer but less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history many iraqi civilians went about their lives with minimal interference from the allied air raids the stories of hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk yes bunk the us lost servicemen in ww over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting but we are expected to swallow that hundreds of thousands of civilian iraqis died in a war lasting about months and with the allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that what hogwash if hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilians died it was due to actions hussein took on his own people not due to the allied bombing regards jim b

re amusing atheists and anarchists mccullou whipple cs wisc edu writes my turn i went back and reread your post all you did is attack atheism and say that agnosticism wasn t as funny as atheism nowhere does that imply that you are agnostic or weak atheist as most people who post such inflammatory remarks are theists it was a reasonable assumption sorry you re right i did not clearly state it rule condescending to the population at large i e theists will not win many people to your faith anytime soon it only ruins your credibility how am i being condescending to the population at large i am stating something that happened to be true for a long time i couldn t believe that people actually believed in this god idea it was an alien concept to me i am not trying to win people to my faith as you put it i have no faith religion was a non issue when i had the attitude above because it never even occurred to me to believe atheist by default i guess you could say the most common form of condescending is the rational versus irrational attitude once one has accepted the assumption that there is no god s and then consider other faiths to be irrational simply because their assumption s contradict your assumption then i would say there s a lack of consistency here now i know you ll get on me about faith if the positive belief that god does not exist were a closed logical argument why do so many rational people have problems with that logic but you probably like me seem to be a soft atheist sorry for the flamage the line about atheists haveing something up their sleeves is what seemed to imply that sorry been reading too much on the clipper project lately and the paranoia over there may have seeped in some what is the clipper project btw rule don t mix apples with oranges how can you say that the extermination by the mongols was worse than stalin khan conquered people unsympathetic to his cause that was atrocious but stalin killed millions of his own people who loved and worshipped him and his atheist state how can anyone be worse than that many rulers have done similar things in the past only stalin did it when there was plenty of documentation to afix the blame on him the evidence is that some of the early european rulers ruled with an iron fist much like stalin s you threw in numbers and i am sick of hearing about stalin as an example because the example doesn t apply you managed to get me angry with your post because it appeared to attack all forms of atheism it might have appeared to attack atheism in general but its point was that mass killing happens for all sorts of reasons people will hate who they will and will wave whatever flag to justify it be it cross or hammer sickle the stalin example is important not only because it s still a widely unappreciated era that people want to forget but also because people really did love him and his ideas even after all that he had wrought the evidence i am referring to is more a lack of evidence than negative evidence say i claim there are no pink crows i have never seen a pink crow but that doesn t mean it couldn t exist but this person here claims that there are pink crows even though he admits he hasn t been able to capture one or get a photo or find one with me etc in a sense that is evidence to not believe in the existence of pink crows that is what i am saying when i look at the evidence i look at the suppossed evidence for a deity show how it is flawed and doesn t show what theists want it to show and go on first all the pink crows unicorns elves arguments in the world will not sway most people for they simply do not accept the analogy why one of the big reasons is that many many people want something beyond this life you can pretend that they don t want this but i for one can accept it and even want it myself sometimes and there is nothing unique in this example of why people want a god can love as a truth be proven logically themselves namely a god or gods so in principle it s hard to see how theists are necessarily arrogant makes no sense to me they seem arrogant to make such a claim to me but my previous refutation still stands and i believe there may be another one on the net john the baptist boasted of jesus to many people i find it hard to see how that behavior is arrogant at all many christians i know also boast in this way but i still do not necessarily see it as arrogance of course i do know arrogant christians doctors and teachers as well technically you might consider the person who originally made a given claim to be arrogant jesus for instance are you talking about all atheism or just strong atheism if you are talking about weak atheism which i believe in then i refuse such a claim atheism is a lack of belief i used good ol occam s razor to make the final rejection of a deity in that as i see things even if i present the hypothesises in an equal fasion i find the theist argument not plausible i speak against strong atheism i also often find that the evidence supporting a faith is very subjective just as say the evidence supporting love as truth is subjective i believe i answered that i apologize for the as you stated incorrect assumption on your theism but i saw nothing to indicate that you were an agnostic only that you were just another newbie christian on the net trying to get some cheap shots in no apology necessary bake timmons iii there s nothing higher stronger more wholesome and more useful in life than some good memory alyosha in brothers karamazov dostoevsky

re some thoughts in article saturn wwc edu bissda saturn wwc edu dan lawrence bissell writes first i want to start right out and say that i m a christian it makes sense to be one have any of you read tony campollo s book liar lunatic or the real thing i might be a little off on the title but he writes the book anyway he was part of an effort to destroy christianity in the process he became a christian himself sounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy just what organization did he belong to does it have a name the book says that jesus was either a liar or he was crazy a modern day koresh or he was actually who he said he was logic alert artificial trifercation the are many other possible explainations could have been that he never existed there have been some good points made in this group that is not impossible that jc is an amalgam of a number of different myths mithra comes to mind some reasons why he wouldn t be a liar are as follows who would die for a lie wouldn t people be able to tell if he was a liar people gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing someone who was or had been healed call me a fool but i believe he did heal people logic alert argument from incredulity just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn t mean that it isn t true liars can be very pursuasive just look at koresh that you yourself site he has followers that don t think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die by not giving up after getting shot himself koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what he believes as far as healing goes if i rememer right the healing that was attributed is not consistent between the different gospels in one of them the healing that is done is not any more that faith healers can pull off today seems to me that the early gospels weren t that compeling so the stories got bigger to appeal better niether was he a lunatic would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was crazy very doubtful in fact rediculous for example anyone who is drawn to david koresh is obviously a fool logical people see this right away therefore since he wasn t a liar or a lunatic he must have been the real thing or might not have existed or any number of things that is the logical pitfall that those who use flawed logic like this fall into there are bifurcations or tri quad etc that are valid because in the proceeding steps the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are possible once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are then arguments among the alternatives can be presentent and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding all other possible alternatives however if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive then any conclusions bases on the incomplete set are invalid even if the true choice is one of the original choices i have given at least one valid alternative so the conclusion that jc is the real mccoy just because he isn t one of the other two alternative is no longer valid some other things to note he fulfilled loads of prophecies in the psalms isaiah and elsewhere in hrs alone this in his betrayal and crucifixion i don t have my bible with me at this moment next time i write i will use it jc was a rabbi he knew what those prophecies were it wouldn t be any great shakes to make sure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy what would be compeling is if there were a set of clear and explicit prophecies and jc had absolutely no knowledge of then yet fullfilled them anyway i don t think most people understand what a christian is it is certainly not what i see a lot in churches rather i think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for god s sake he loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the same hey we can t do it god himself inspires us to turn our lives over to him that s tuff and most people don t want to do it to be a real christian would be something for the strong to persevere at but just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes time we don t rush it in one day christianity is your whole life it is not going to church once a week or helping poor people once in a while we box everything into time units such as work at this time sports tv social life god is above these boxes and should be carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for ourselves here i agree with you anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says seriously and what it says is that it must be a total way of life i have very little respect for xians that don t if the myth is true then it is true in its entirity the picking and choosing that i see a lot of leaves a bad taste in my mouth jim james l felder sverdrup technology inc phone nasa lewis research center cleveland ohio email jfelder lerc nasa gov some people drink from the fountain of knowledge other people gargle

re after years can we say that christian morality is reply to frank d s uucp frank o dwyer i m one of those people who does not know what the word objective means when put next to the word morality i assume its an idiom and cannot be defined by its separate terms give it a try objective morality is morality built from objective values from a dictionary of philosophy by anthony flew objectivism the belief that there are certain moral truths that would remain true whatever anyone or everyone thought or desired for instance no one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another simply to take pleasure in his suffering might be thought of as a plausible example even in a world of sadists who all rejected it the contention remains true just as remains correct even if there is no one left to count the problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be established if we accept that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to what ought to be see naturalistic fallacy then they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world nor can they be analytic since this would involve lack of action guiding content one ought always to do the right thing is plainly true in virtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to action see analytic and synthetic at this point the objectivist may talk of self evident truths but can he deny the subjectivist s claim that self evidence is in the mind of the beholder if not what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true the subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself to hold a moral opinion is he suggests not to know something to be true but to have preferences regarding human activity david nye nyeda cnsvax uwec edu midelfort clinic eau claire wi this is patently absurd but whoever wishes to become a philosopher must learn not to be frightened by absurdities bertrand russell

re islamic authority over women benedikt rosenau i dbstu rz tu bs de wrote when the object of their belief is said to be perfect and make the believers act in a certain way and we observe that they don t we have a contradiction something defined contradictorily cannot exist that what the believe in does not exist secondly there are better explanations for why they believe than the existence of the object of their belief have you read the faq already benedikt benedikt i can t recall anyone claiming that god makes anyone act a particlar way i think that you re attempting to manufacture a contradiction god is said to require certain behavior but the only compulsion is the believer s sense of duty a standard of conduct does exist but we are free to ignore it or misunderstand it or distort it in whatever ways we find convenient but our response to god s edicts can in no way be used to question god s existence the behavior of believers is a completely separate question from that of god s existence there is nothing contradictory here to say that something defined contadictorily cannot exist is really asking too much you would have existence depend on grammar all you can really say is that something is poorly defined but that in itself is insufficient to decide anything other than confusion of course your point that there are better reasons for the phenomenon of belief than the object of belief may lead to a rat s nest of unnecessary complexity i think i know what you re implying but i d like to see your version of this better alternative just the same bill

re thoughts on christians kent sandvik sandvik newton apple com wrote this is a good point but i think average people do not take up christianity so much out of fear or escapism but quite simply as a way to improve their social life or to get more involved with american culture if they are kids of immigrants for example since it is the overwhelming major religion in the western world in some form or other it is simply the choice people take if they are bored and want to do something new with their lives but not somethong too new or too out of the ordinary seems a little weak but as long as it doesn t hurt anybody the social pressure is indeed a very important factor for the majority of passive christians in our world today in the case of early christianity the promise of a heavenly afterlife independent of your social status was also a very promising gift reason slaves and non romans accepted the religion very rapidly if this is a hypothetical proposition you should say so if it s fact you should cite your sources if all this is the amateur sociologist sub branch of a a however it would suffice to alert the unwary that you are just screwing around bill

re the inimitable rushdie re an anecdote about islam in article apr cs nott ac uk eczcaw mips nott ac uk c wainwright writes in article bu edu jaeger buphy bu edu gregg jaeger writes the authorities i am referring to is the authority of the world islamic community over itself my point was simply that islamic law does apply to muslims wherever they are despite the fact that islamic law may not be enforcable in non islamic countries muslims residing in the uk may decide to be tried or whatever by the islamic community but their rulings have no legal consequences in these isles it s not really their decision to be tried the rulings do have legal consequences but only in islamic law and not in uk law this should be obvious enforcing a judgment is distinct from the making of a judgment take for example the judgments of the world court this is an internationally recognized tribunal whose judgments often have no physical or economic effect but which are important despite the fact that their judgments cannot be enforced the person may be excommunicated or similar but if it decided to mete out violent laws such as the fatwa then it would be breaking uk laws itself and the persons doing such would be liable to prosecution of course have you read any of this thread before this post to ignore the country s laws in preference to religious laws which are not indigenous to the country in question is an absurd and arrogant notion of course it is a sort of anarchism anarchism is explicitly against islam thank you for your well reasoned response but it is beside the points i ve been making in this thread gregg

nostalgia the recent rise of nostalgia in this group combined with the incredible level of utter bullshit has prompted me to comb through my archives and pull out some of the best of alt atheism for your reading pleasure i ll post a couple of these a day unless group concensus demands that i stop or i run out of good material i haven t been particularly careful in the past about saving attributions i think the following comes from john a johnson but someone correct me if i m wrong this is probably the longest of my entire collection so that the prophecy be fulfilled in considering the christian religion and judging it according to its claims it is important to look at its claims at fulfilling earlier jewish prophecy the scribe matthew is perhaps the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in the career of jesus of nazareth as you will see matthew s main strategy is to take various old testament passages often not even about the promised messiah and apply them to the circumstances in the new testament we must also bear in mind the question of the authenticity of the accounts since the gospels were written at least years after jesus was executed we do not know how much happened exactly as stated but for purposes of analysis we will take particular claims at face value immanuel we begin of course at the beginning mt mary will bear a son and you joseph will name him jesus which means g d is salvation for he will save his people from their sins all this happened to fulfil what the lord had spoken by a prophet isaiah in the days of ahaz c bce king of judah rezin of syria and pekah of israel made war on jerusalem capitol of judah but could not quite conquer it when the house of david i e ahaz and his court in judah were told of this its heart and the heart of its people shook and the lord g d said to isaiah go to meet with ahaz and the lord spoke to ahaz through prophet isaiah naturally saying ask a sign of g d your lord it can be as deep as sheol or as high as heaven but ahaz said i won t ask i will not put the lord to a test then isaiah said hear then o house of david is it not enough for you to weary men that you must weary my god too therefore the lord himself will give you a sign behold a young woman is with child and will bear a son and name him immanuel which means g d is with us he will eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil and choose good for before the child knows how to refuse evil and choose good the land of the two kings you dread will have been deserted matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics further he the hebrew word almah young woman as specifically virgin but this is not a prophecy about the messiah it is not a prophecy about an event to happen years later it is not a prophecy about a virgin bethulah mother in short it not about jesus matthew has made use of a verse out of context and tries to make it fit the specific case of mary it should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general manner a very general one it can be made to fit mary mary virgin or not was indeed a young woman with child of course the fit is shady and has problems jesus while thought of by later christians to be g d walking among men was never called by the name immanuel if christianity wished to claim this prophecy for jesus it becomes at best a cut and paste prophecy a second class prophecy not too convincing egypt after jesus s birth in bethlehem matthew tells about a quick and elsewhere unmentioned excursion to egypt as if he wishes to liken jesus to moses this was done to escape an alleged infanticidal rampage of the king herod mt and remained there until the death of herod this was to fulfil what the lord had spoken out of egypt i have cal led my son what the lord really said was this hosea when israel was a child i loved him and out of egypt i called my son the more i called them my people the more they went from me they kept sacrificing to the ba als and kept burning incense to idols matthew conveniently omits the rest of hosea s oracle but it was indeed israel that once called out of egypt wanted to return this is history jesus is certainly not being spoken of here and if we are to draw some kind of parallel here we wind up with a jesus that flees and resists g d again this prophecy is just not as convincing as matthew probably had hoped rachel weeps while jesus is off vacationing in egypt matthew says that king herod sought to kill him and thus ordered the executions of all young male children matthew then writes mt by this that which was spoken by the prophet jeremiah was fulfilled a voice was heard in ramah wailing and loud lamentation rachel weeping for her children she refused to be consoled because they were no more the reference is to a passage in jeremiah referring to the carrying off of israel into exile by sargon of assyria in bce rachel the ancestor of the major tribes of israel ephraim and manasseh is said to weep for her descendants who are no more it is metaphorical of course since rachel lived and dies before the hebrews were even in the egyptian exile it is interesting to note that it was leah not rachel who was the ancestor of the judeans the land where jesus and bethlehem were if anyone should do weeping for her children it is leah the only connexion that rachel has with bethlehem is that the legends have it that she was buried north of the city on the way to ephrath bethlehem as for herod and his infanticide it is rather unlikely that such an event actually occurred one never knows but the event is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the bible nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time herod was particularly unliked in his reign and many far less evil deeds of herod were carefully recorded this might be a prime example of how events were added to jesus s life to enhance the message of the church s gospel because of the whole story s similarity to the tale of the infant moses in egypt it is highly likely that it is a device set up by matthew to add prophetic yet artificial approval of jesus it is not surprising that matthew conveniently neglects to mention the rest of the jeremiah quote the children the prophet speaks of are not dead but exiled in the assyrian empire g d comforts the weeping rachel saying that the children will be returned he will gather them back together of course this would not suit matthew s purpose as the children he speaks of are dead for good again the prophecy matthew sets up is not even that and to anyone who bothers to check it out is not too convincing the nazarene we do not even have to go to the next chapter to find another matthean prophecy after leaving egypt joseph wife take the infant jesus to live in the city of nazareth mt that what was spoken of by the prophets might be fulfilled he shall be called a nazarene first thing we notice is that matthew does not mention the name of the prophet s this time second we have to ask who he is there are no messianic prophecies speaking of a nazarene worse there are no prophecies period mentioning a nazarene still worse there are no nazarenes mentioned in the old testament at all in the book of judges an angel tells samson s mother that she will judges conceive and bear a son no razor shall tough his head for he will be a nazirite to his god from the day of his birth he will deliver israel from the hands of the philistines this is of course not a prophecy of jesus or the messiah of g d but it is the best that can be found obviously matthew has begun to go overboard in cut and paste prophecies in that he is simple making them up now bearing our diseases jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses and disabilities mt this was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet isaiah he took our infirmities and bore our diseases as expected the verse quoted in isaiah is quoted out of context and a few words are skewed to fit the christian scheme we have is surely he the suffering servant has borne our sickness and carried our pains from a reading of the surrounding passages in isaiah we know that the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation of israel jehovah s chosen servant and people he speaks to the israelites suffering in exile in the voice of the gentile nations that look upon it this image is deeply ingrained in jewish identity an image of a chastised yet cherished israel as the instrument of the nations salvation by g d the verses speak of israel taking on the sicknesses which are the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and discipline they do not speak of a servant going around and healing people notice that the servant in isaiah takes on the sicknesses and pains of the nations and individual jews jesus as we all know did not take the diseases onto himself the verses here in isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come but rather something that had already happened while it is believed that jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell he did not bear the illnesses he healed so while someone might want to say that figuratively jesus reenacted the deeds of israel in his spiritual atonement he has to admit that matthew s parallel misses where he intended it to have its effect silent messiah upon healing multitudes of commoners it is said that jesus ordered them to keep quiet presumable so that he wouldn t arouse the attention of the local rulers mt this was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet isaiah behold my servant whom i have chosen my beloved with whom my soul is pleased i will put my spirit on him and he will announce justice to the gentiles he will not wrangle or cry aloud nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets he will not break a bruised reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings justice to victory and the gentiles will hope in his name the isaiah passage quoted reads is behold my servant whom i uphold my chosen in whom my soul delights i have put my spirit on him and he will bring forth justice to the nations we will not cry or lift up his voice or make it heard in the street he will not break a bruised reed or quench a smoldering wick he will faithfully bring forth justice he will not fail burn dimly or be discouraged bruised until he has established justice in the earth and the coastlands await his law you see matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage because it does not suit the dealings of jesus christians could never think of jesus failing never would the light of mankind burn dimly but the servant nation of israel will indeed come to an end when its job is done when the gentiles come to embrace g d there will no longer be a chosen people but rather all will be the children of g d also the ending phrase has been changed from the judaic the coastlands await his law to the christologic the gentiles will hope in his name while the original proclaims the torah law of jehovah the other rewrites it to fit its strange doctrine of believing in the name if one has any doubt the servant referred to is not jesus one has only to read the whole chapter isaiah and hear about the beloved but blind and imperfect servant a people robbed and plundered so we see that when matthew s attempt at prophecy is examined it crumbles three days and three nights now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very mouth of the god jesus himself he speaks of his crucifixion and resurrection mt for as jonah was in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights so will the son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights before any further discussion can occur it is necessary to know how the jews understood days as far as day names went each was hours long lasting from sunset pm to the following sunset pm what was referred to as a day was the period of light from am to the ending sunset at pm thus according to our time scale a sabbath day began at pm friday evening and lasted until pm saturday evening this is why the jews celebrate their sabbath on the daylight portion of saturdays instead of sundays it seems like a real miracle that christians didn t forget that saturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week thus when days and nights are referred to together hour daylight portions and hour night periods are being spoken of thus jesus says that he will be in the grave or in hell or otherwise unresurrected for three days and three nights as the good book tells us jesus was crucified on the ninth hour which is pm friday afternoon he then was put into the grave sometime after that then jesus left the grave rose before dawn of what we call sunday the dawn after the sabbath was over what this means is that jesus was using our time for clarity in the grave from pm friday night to some time before am sunday morning we could also add a little time before pm friday since the bible is not specific here what this means using jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day two nights and possibly a couple of hours of one day certainly this is a problem for jesus prediction there is absolutely no way we are even able to have his death involve three days and three nights even using modern time measurements we then are led to suspect that this error is another one of matthew s little mistakes and that the gospel writer put false words into his god s mouth and no matter who made the prediction it is more than unconvincing it is counter convincing hearing understanding jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in parables stories in which a deeper meaning could be found if you were already one of the elect those chosen to understand the message of jesus he reasons that those who can understand the parables are the ones he wants if the people cannot understand them there is no need to bother with them since they will not accept the plain message any better matthew says mt with them the audience indeed in fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah which says you will indeed hear but never understand and you will indeed see but never perceive because this people s heart has grown dull their ears are heavy of hearing and they have shut their eyes so the they would not perceive with them her with their ears and understand with their heart and turn for me to heal them the original isaiah passages are part of his earlier works his call to the ministry this is in bce when israel is flourishing right before it falls under the authority of assyria isaiah sees the good times ending and also a vision from g d calling him to bring reform to israel and judah is and g d said go and say to this people hear and hear but do not understand see and see but do not perceive make the heart of this people fat make their ears heavy and shut their eyes so they will not see with their eyes or hear with their ears and understand with their hearts and turn and be healed then isaiah said how long lord and he said until the cities lie waste without inhabitant and houses without men and the land is utterly desolate and the g ds take men far away and forsaken places are many in the land and though a tenth will remain in it it will be burned again like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still stands when the tree is felled the holy seed is its stump here we see that it is really g d who causes the people of israel to stop listening to the prophet s warnings but reaffirms the promise made to solomon s and david s seed lineage if you read the rest of isaiah you find that this is done to fulfil the plan of g d to use israel as a servant a light to the nations look at isaiah we see that matthew has cut and pasted just a little portion of isaiah s verse to suit his own gospel needs more than that he has altered the words to make it fit the people who didn t understand jesus s stories and as we see isaiah s verses are not prophecies but rather commands from g d to him in the present once again matthew s prophecy falls flat on its face matthew tries again to make jesus s parables look like they have the prophetic approval mt he said nothing to them without a parable this was to fulfil what was spoken of by the prophet i will open my mouth to them in parables i will utter that which has been hidden since the foundation of the world matthew really botches up here he attempts to quote not from a prophet but from the psalms ps i will open my mouth in parable i will utter dark sayings of old things that we all have heard and known things that our fathers have told us we will not hide them from their children but tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the lord as was pointed out the verses in the psalms do not really come from a prophet you might also want to know that earlier copies of matthew s gospel even inserted isaiah s name as this prophet apparently later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some of it up perhaps the most significant part of this is that once again matthew has altered the old testament scriptures as jesus has said earlier he speaks in parables so that some will not understand them the parables in the psalms are not to be hidden further they speak of things known that our fathers have told us jesus deals with things hidden since the foundation of the world indeed jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion this is in direct opposition to the parables in the psalms no wonder matthew had to rewrite them and still once again matthew s artificial prophecies fall flat on their face but christians rarely look at this matthew s prophecies aren t the only things about christianity that are beginning to look bad excuses of little faith in mt we see that the disciples are able to go around casting out demons except in one case not knowing what epilepsy was the people thought those with the disease were possesed with demons it is no wonder that the disciples were unable to dispossess the epileptic but jesus perhaps no more enlightened than they is reported to have rebuked them saying they didn t have enough faith this seems strange why was this demon special it seems that either a true believer has faith or he does not apparently enough faith will allow someone to move mountains of course you will find no one these days that can move real mountains no one parts seas the only miracles the charismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to mexico or some faraway place major miracles are making some old woman s arthritis feel better on sunday morning t v and the gods including jesus are always shrouded in ancient lore and writings protected from the skeptics in their sacred pasts they are either dead sleeping or hiding in heaven with people rumouring about their imminent return and their great miracles of days long gone yet life goes on tales of mystics stories of miracles all in a distant time or a distant place gods used to reveal themselves to men in the old days jehovah too but now they are silent all the theologians give are various excuses as to why we don t get to see god anymore we re too lazy we re not zealous enough we re sinful it s just his plan we put too many of our own demands on g d s appearance if we had the right faith if we were willing to meet g d on his terms yet even the most pious of men have not seen g d you dear reader have not seen g d not literally you know that to be true i know that s presumptuous and bold but searching your heart you know what i mean all that we ve seen religions do is make people feel good and content about not seeing g d they say our little faith does not merit us to see g d sometimes they say see the love in these people you worship with see the lives of people change that is seeing g d thus people get lulled to sleep satisfied with turning g d into the everyday sights but that is not seeing g d as i am speaking of it is not seeing g d the way people used to see what we see in the world that is good is the compassion of human hearts the love given and taken by men and women the forgiveness practised by christian atheist alike beauty created by the mind of man these are the things that are done these are what we see but it is said this is so only because everybody has little faith jesus rides on an ass shortly after accepting the role of the jewish messiah king jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into jerusalem mt this took place to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet saying tell the daughter of zion behold your king is coming to you humble mounted on an ass and on a ass colt of course the passage quoted from zechariah reads a little differently lo your king comes to you he is triumphant and victorious humble and riding on an ass on an ass colt he will command peace to the nations there isn t all that much difference here except that zechariah only involves one animal an ass colt while matthew reads the poetic wording slightly differently thus he has jesus call for both a colt and an adult ass from matthew s version we get a comical picture of the divine christ sweating it to straddle two donkeys this could inevitably lead to a theological proctological dilemma we find that in the account written earlier by st mark only the colt was called for and brought to jesus this indeed fits the verses of zechariah properly and shows us that in matthew attempt to use prophetic verses he has bungled now excluding many respectable christians i have met i have noticed that while christ is thought to have ridden on asses the situation is often reversed nowadays then entering the jerusalem temple the priests were angered at people and youngsters calling jesus the messiah but jesus replied as we might expect matthew to have done mt haven t you read out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise it is more likely that matthew made this response up since jesus was never one to point out such little prophetic things and since as we might expect the quote is in error which seems to fit matthew s track record quite well we might ask jesus or matthew haven t you read for the source reads psalms o yahweh our lord how majestic is your name in the whole world you whose glory is chanted above the heavens by babes and infants you have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the enemy and the avenger the passages hardly need comment there is no perfect praise spoken of in the psalm and what praise is there is given to g d not his messiah king and not jesus as mentioned it seems to be just one more case of matthew s pen making up convenient prophetic scripture yhvh said to my lord jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised jewish messiah king is to be descended the jews agree it is king david but then jesus counters by quoting psalms the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i put your enemies under your feet taken at face value jesus is denying the necessity of davidic descent one assumes he is in opposition to their answer of course the christian answer is that he agrees but is trying to make some hidden point to reveal some mystery about the divine nature of the messiah king it s tempting to believe this if one is a christian and not interested in matters of investigation but there are problems in jesus s time the psalm was thought to be about the messiah and it is easy to see why david might refer to the messiah as his superior we need only look at the scriptures about the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king bringing the jews to times even better than those under david s rule of course the jews listening had no good answer and the passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah such as the christians worship the problem lies in the meaning of this psalm an error that apparently several jews of jesus s time had also made one must remember that there were various factions among the jews often as a result of different expectations of the messiah king jesus was apparently one of these adventists like his audience who thought the messiah s advent was imminent and who interpreted psalms among others as being messianic what is the problem then psalm literally reads yhvh s utterance to my lord sit at my right hand until i make your enemies your footstool yhvh sends forth your mighty scepter from zion rule in the midst of your foes your people will offer themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the holy mountains you are a priest of the order of melchizedek forever the word lord is often mistakenly capitalised by christian bibles to denote divinity in this lord but in the hebrew the word is adoni and no capitalisation exists adoni simply means lord a generic term as we would use it it is used often in the scriptures to refer to kings and to g d it is merely an address of respect there is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word refers either to divinity or to the messiah king that this is supposed to be written by david is not certain the title of the psalm translates to either a psalm of david or a psalm about david it seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court poet about david s covenant and endorsement from g d if the psalm had been written by david it is unlikely that he would be talking about the messiah the idea of a perfect king descended from david was not present in david s age we have extensive tales of david s doings and sayings none of which include any praises of a messiah many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after david was dead in times of the exile when g d had put his show of favour for david s kingdom on hold the description in the psalm fit david very well david was promised by g d a rise to power victory over his enemies successful judgement among the nations he conquered he achieved the priesthood common to melchizedek in being a righteous king enabled to bless the people it all fits we do not have to blame this problem on matthew alone though here there is not artificial prophecy alluded to though his use of the scripture is rather questionable still this event is common to the other gospels too so we let matthew off a little more easily this time it is interesting to note though how matthew dresses up the event the earlier gospel of mark tells the tale with jesus simply speaking to a crowd matthew has the pharisees who became the religious competition of an infant christianity be the target of jesus s question as we might expect matthew writes that the event ends up by embarrassing the pharisees such power is the pen moses jesus had it together all along we leave the gospel story of matthew momentarily to see a pseudo prophecy in john s gospel the gospel story of john deserves special treatment because it seems to be so far removed from the real events of jesus s career as told by even matthew but for the moment we will just look at one verse the early church leaders founded a religion on the jewish hopes of a messiah king and on an artificial extension of the original promises made by g d when constructing the history of abraham moses wrote of a promise of land and nationhood to the jewish people while this was accomplished eventually under the rule of king david the christians who came along later decided that they would claim the fulfillment of the promise but to do so they expanded on the promise preaching about a heavenly kingdom john j c speaking your father abraham rejoiced to see my day he say it and was glad it would be nice to tie in approval for jesus from abraham but abraham knew nothing of jesus or a messiah or anything christian i have tried and failed to find any event in the old testament which corresponds to john s little prophecy it is par for the course to see st john making up old testament backings just like his forerunner matthew many christians know that their faith has many of its foundations in such fraud and it is surprising they still cling to it the potter s field we are told that jesus was betrayed while in jerusalem by one of his followers judas iscariot matthew writes mt and throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple judas departed but the chief priests taking the silver said it isn t lawful for us to put it in the treasury since it is blood money so they bought a potter s field with it to bury strangers in then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet jeremiah and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of israel and they gave them for the potter s field as the lord directed me this prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of old testament scripture first matthew has made a mistake regarding the name of the prophet it is zechariah who utters the verses which matthew makes use of zech and they weighed out my wages thirty shekels of silver then yhvh said to me cast them to the treasury the lordly price at which i was paid off by them so i took the thirty shekels of silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of yhvh first of all the verses of zechariah do not deal with a betrayer of the messiah or of g d the deal with a shepherd most likely a priest chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people shortly before g d would send judah and israel into conflict with one another the word treasury had been replaced by the king james scholars with to the potter precisely because this made matthew s quote fit better but this is a blatant error the correct translation of the hebrew is indeed treasury which also makes perfect sense in zechariah s context whereas potter s field is totally unrelated whether the mistranslation was intentional or not seems to be beyond speculation however given matthew s track record one finds it hard to resist the notion of intentional dishonesty of course matthew would have ample reason for altering the text the thirty pieces of silver match judas s situation and if as most christians seem to be the reader is willing to disregard the contextual incongruity matthew might have another prophecy to toss around however the correct translation of zechariah directly contradicts the situation with judas and the high priests the high priests would not put the money in the treasury the worthless shepherd of zechariah does exactly the opposite of course to the average thursday night bible student the prophecy as presented by matthew would be taken at new testament face value to those matthew s work is convincing enough wine vinegar casting lots then jesus is led away to be crucified mt they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall but when he tasted it he would not drink it and when they had crucified him they divided his garments among them by casting lots that it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet they parted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots first of all the vinegar offered to jesus is actually common sour wine of the type that roman soldiers drank regularly we find that right before jesus dies the soldiers themselves give him some to drink not polluted with gall jn jesus said i thirst a bowl of vinegar stood there so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth when he had received the vinegar he said it is finished but matthew seems to be drawing on not a passage from the prophets but one from the psalms ps i looked for pity but there was none and for comforters but i found none they gave me poison for food lit they put gall in my meat and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink add to them punishment upon punishment may they have no acquittal from thee let them be blotted out of the book of the living of course the sour wine offered to jesus is done at his request of drink this does indeed seem to be a show of pity the psalm quoted is about david and his political and military enemies it is not about the messiah or jesus it is then not surprising that we run into further problem when we see that the jesus in the psalm asks g d for the damnation of the crucifiers whereas the jesus of the gospels says lk jesus said father forgive them the don t know what they do further matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by having gall a bitter substance put into jesus s drink not his meat as the psalm stipulates with the prophecy of the vinegar faulty we naturally ask what of the casting of lots this brings up the nd psalm which deserves discussion all by itself suffice it now to say that the fact that jesus s clothes were divided as told is no great thing it turns out that this happened often to any felon in those days as we will soon see it is perhaps the least erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to jesus it does indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of jesus s clothes for a man so removed from worldly possessions his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some suspicions the nd psalm this psalm is attributed to david as a lament of his condition under the attack of his enemies it becomes a song of praise to yhvh and of hope taken out of context parts of it seem to fit the plight of jesus at the crucifixion quite well we will examine the primary passages verse my god my god why have you forsaken me why are you so far from helping me far from the words of my groaning oh my god i cry by day but you don t answer and by night but find no rest jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross this suggests that the whole psalm is really about jesus rather than king david of course the rest of the first stanza does not fit as nicely to jesus or his execution jesus is not pictured as complaining about the whole ordeal he is supposed to be like the lamb led mute before its shearers indeed jesus doesn t do much groaning even when on the cross he certainly does not cry by both day and night on the cross but i am a worm and no man scorned by men all who see me mock at me they make faces and wag their heads he committed his cause to yhvh so let him deliver him for he delights in him this seems to fit jesus s execution pretty well with the exception of the holy messiah being called a worm many bulls encompass me they open their mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion yea dogs are round about me a company of evildoers encir cle me they have pierced my hands and feet i can see all my bones they divide my garments among them and cast lost for my raiment but you yhvh be not far away deliver my soul from the sword my life from the power of the dog save me from the mouth of the lion and my afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull it would seem quite convincing and i m sure the early christian fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too unfortunately this prophecy has a fatal flaw the words have pierced really do not exist in the psalm the correct hebrew translation is yea dogs are round about me a company of evildoers encircles me like the lion they are at my hands and feet in hebrew the phrase like the lion and a very rare verb form which can mean pierced differ by one phonetic character the word in the hebrew text is literally like the lion ka ari which makes sense in the context and even further fits the animal imagery employed by the psalm writer it is convenience that would urge a christian to change the word to ka aru but to add the needed yet artificial weight to the prophecy this is just what the christian translators have chosen to do while the correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to jesus its absence does not say much for the honesty of the translators apart from the erroneous verse the psalm does not lend itself to jesus so easily verse speaks of the sufferer being saved from a sword rather than a cross this naturally fits the psalm s true subject king david as a side note we now know that crucifixions did not pierce the hands the palms but rather the forearms this doesn t say much in favour of the traditional thought of a resurrected jesus showing his disciples the scars on his palms but then facts aren t bound by our religious beliefs matthew escapes culpability this time as he does not attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord jesus but the psalm like many others was on the minds of all the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and interpretations of jesus s life and death how much these scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down is a question that has serious repercussions for christian theology it is easy to see for those who are not faithful fundamentalists how some of the events in the new testament might have been enhanced by scribes such as the eager matthew but it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural matters and prophetic claims so far this has not said good things for st matthew the reference to the piercing looks a lot like jesus s crucifixion john s gospel recount written about years after the fact tells us at jesus s execution jn but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear and out came blood and water these things took place that scripture be fulfilled the will look on him whom they ve pierced of course this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of context prophet zechariah tells us how much of the nation of israel will split off from jerusalem and judah and go to war with them zc and yhvh will give victory to judah and on that day i will seek to destroy the nations that come against jerusalem in judah and i will pour a spirit of compassion and supplication on jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have pierced they will mourn and weep bitterly over him like you weep over a firstborn child john s attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that matthew s attempts matthew at least usually excontexts more than just one passage john s errors are grossly obvious and blatant here it does not speak well for any of the gospel writers as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their religion were founded reckoned with transgressors after his arrest jesus is quickly executed for claiming the jewish kingship messiahship according to one version of the gospel tale jesus gets executed along with two thieves mk and with him they crucified two robbers one on his right one on his left and so the scripture was fulfilled which says he was reckoned with the transgressors here mark is trying to link jesus to a passage in isaiah about the servant nation of israel the passage is not about the messiah for if one reads the whole chapter of isaiah and its surrounding chapters one sees that the servant is a nation the verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the past not a prediction of what is to come in any event the servant is thought of as a criminal this also happens to fit the description of jesus had the passage really been about the messiah it still is not at all clear why executing jesus between two thieves would fulfill the prophecy in isaiah jesus would more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry he was considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his career locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to steal prophecy at least in this case as we see that mark could have had made a better analogy with general comparisons mark goes on to tell us how those who were crucified with jesus also reviled him this is to be expected from a couple of robbers of course in his later recount st luke decides to change some things luke tells us lk and one of the criminals who was hanged with him railed aren t you the messiah save yourself and us this certainly fits with mark s recount which tells how the people who crucified jesus said save yourself and that the robbers did the same but then luke goes on but the other criminal rebuked the first saying don t you fear g d since you are under the same sentence of condemnation and we indeed justly so for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds but this man has done nothing wrong and he said jesus remember me when you come in your kingdom and jesus answered verily i say to you today you will be with me in paradise now this little dialogue seems highly contrived it stretches the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech we have a rather strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his punishment and the justness of his suffering such a man apparently noble and of principle doesn t seem likely to have been a robber we wonder at the amount of theatrics created by luke of course luke s recount also disagrees with mark s luke has only one criminal revile jesus not both it is easy enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made up but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free words of g d do not have this avenue open this is yet another example of a writer trying to take an old testament passage and expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology in this case the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems as we have seen the end of the world mt now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and embarrassing passages in the new testament it is found in all three of the synoptic gospel stories and casts some of the most unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of christianity jesus mentions the destruction of the jewish temples and buildings and his disciples ask him about this and about the end of the world which he has been warning about the disciples tell us when will this the temple s destruction be and what will be the sign of your coming and of the close of the age jesus take care that no one leads you astray for many will come in my name saying i am the christ you will hear of wars and rumours of wars for this must take place but the end is not yet for nation will rise against nation all this is but the beginning of the birthpangs they will deliver you up put you to death and false prophets will arise and lead many astray but he who endures to the end will be saved this gospel will be preached throughout the whole world a testimony to the nations and then the end will come so when you see the desolation spoken of by the prophet daniel let those who are in judea flee to the mountains immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened the stars will fall from heaven then will appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and all the tribes of the earth will mourn and see the son of man coming and he will send out his angels and gather his elect learn the lesson of the fig tree as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves you know that summer is near so also when you see all these things you will know that he is near at the very gate truly i say to you this generation will not pass away until all these things take place but of the day and hour no one knows not the angels not the son but only the father therefore you also must be ready for the son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect from this it is clear that jesus thought the world would in within the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples he tells them that although he doesn t know the exact day or hour that it will come and thus they must be ready theologians have wet their pants in panic to find some way out of this holy error but unfortunately jesus made himself to explicit he told his disciples that their generation would still be around at the end and that they in particular should prepare for it prepare to be swept away there have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant nature of the bible and said that the phrase this generation shall not pass away really means this race of people will not pass away of course the word for generation is used many times to refer to exactly that the generation of the disciples it is an interesting notion that when god decided to learn greek he didn t learn it well enough to make himself clear but it is quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples at least some of them are supposed to live to the end of the world the charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking at the apostles responses it becomes abundantly clear from rev peter john and rev that jesus meant exactly what he said the end was very near for years christians have rationalised this th chapter of matthew or ignored its meaning altogether for years they have waited for their executed leader to come back hearing of wars and rumours of wars sure that he is coming soon surely he must be all we must do is wait can you imagine how tired he must be sitting around up there being holy waiting for just the right moment to spring so shortly after his crucifixion jesus of nazareth joshua ben joseph died it is said that after three days or three days and three nights or three periods of time or three eternal seconds or three of whatever they can decide makes for less trouble he was seen again resurrected glowing with divine radiance then the saviour decided it wasn t in the best interests of his new religion to stick around and therefore disappeared from sight into heaven so the story goes anyway as has been seen there were many things attributed to jesus when people got around to writing the gospel stories down to them jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture we have seen though that this matter is quite shaky but throughout church history christians have held fast to faith in simple belief what doctrinal objections could not be solved with argumentation or brute force faith and forgetfulness kept away from question to question and investigate has never been the easiest way to treat matters thus for years the prophecies cited in the new testament have gone on largely accepted things may well continue that way for some time pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of christianity have been accepted and used properly or improperly to support wars and persecution i suppose there is one prophecy of which christianity can securely keep hold mt jesus don t think that i have come to bring peace on earth i haven t come to bring peace but rather a sword
re some thoughts bissda saturn wwc edu dan lawrence bissell writes first i want to start right out and say that i m a christian it makes sense to be one have any of you read tony campollo s book liar lunatic or the real thing i might be a little off on the title but he writes the book anyway he was part of an effort to destroy christianity in the process he became a christian himself i assume you are posting to encourage comments how much history has tony campello read not much it seems the arguements he uses i am summing up the book is about whether jesus was god or not i know many of you don t believe but listen to a different perspective for we all have something to gain by listening to what others have to say it is good to hear that there are a few reasonable christians about if only those christian scientists would take note in australia there is a very strong movement a bunch of christian scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly true and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified by using the laws of physics for example there are a few chaps who are trying to prove that the age of the universe is years old and that the error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed light has been rapidly decaying over the years and this has not been accounted for the book says that jesus was either a liar or he was crazy a modern day koresh or he was actually who he said he was or of course that he never existed and the bible was a story and was never intended to become a manifesto for a billion people did tony follow that one up some reasons why he wouldn t be a liar are as follows who would die for a lie wouldn t people be able to tell if he was a liar people gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing someone who was or had been healed millions of people have died for a lie this point is difficult to substantiate since it is not well defined a great many religious arguments work in that way but consider the many aztec warriors who sacrificed themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory of the spanish invaders the list is endless the aztecs lost btw call me a fool but i believe he did heal people that is perfectly reasonable but it is not grounds for me or anyone to become a christian more to the point it does not add weight to the claim that jesus was the real thing niether was he a lunatic would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was crazy very doubtful in fact rediculous for example anyone who is drawn to david koresh is obviously a fool logical people see this right away have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of nazi germany more to the point did tony mention this one could hardly call werner heisenberg and his many colleagues fools or illogical men their support of hitler was based i presume upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with his principles obviously my argument is invalid if tony thought that hitler was sane therefore since he wasn t a liar or a lunatic he must have been the real thing hmmm i don t think his arguments warrant the use of a therefore some other things to note he fulfilled loads of prophecies in the psalms isaiah and elsewhere in hrs alone this in his betrayal and crucifixion i don t have my bible with me at this moment next time i write i will use it this is unfortunately what alot of religious discussions i have had with people result in quoting the bible the only reasonable way i think people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to present if someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally he or she will end up in all sorts of shit tony s argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the events described in the bible took place but to convince someone who thinks the bible is total fiction that jesus is real by quoting the book is totally pointless for example in mathematics you cannot say a is equal to b because a is equal to b i don t think most people understand what a christian is that would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed in religious wars and why there are hundreds of different versions all claiming to be correct it is certainly not what i see a lot in churches rather i think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for god s sake he loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the same hey we can t do it god himself inspires us to turn our lives over to him that s tuff and most people don t want to do it to be a real christian would be something for the strong to persevere at but just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes time we don t rush it in one day christianity is your whole life it is not going to church once a week or helping poor people once in a while we box everything into time units such as work at this time sports tv social life god is above these boxes and should be carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for ourselves i think if you posted this part to alt religion you would get more flames than here i have never really understood why the emotional sentiments of a stranger should be of interest to other people someone famous said that there two evils in life polititians and churchs one rules by fear of the living the other by fear of the dead if i am pressed i could probably find the exact quotation cheers charles

re yet more rushdie re islamic law in article apr bnr ca rashid writes deletions the fatwa was levelled at the person of rushdie any actions of rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling the book remains in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers the fatwa against the person of rushdie encompasses his actions as well the crime was certainly a crime in progress at many levels and was being played out and played up in the the full view of the media p s i m not sure about this but i think the charge of shatim also applies to rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella of the fasad ruling if this is grounded firmly in islam as you claim then you have just exposed islam as the grounds for terrorism plain and simple whether you like it or not whether rushdie acted like a total jerk or not there is no acceptable civilized basis for putting someone in fear of their life for words it simply does not matter whether his underlying motive was to find the worst possible way he could to insult muslims and their beliefs got that you do not threaten the life of someone for words when you do you quite simply admit the backruptcy of your position if you support threatening the life of someone for words you are not yet civilized this is exactly where i and many of the people i know have to depart from respecting the religions of others when those beliefs allow and encourage by interpretation the killing of non physical opposition you or i or anyone are more than privledged to believe that someone whether it be rushdie or bush or hussien or whover is beyond the pale of civilized society and you can condemn his her soul refuse to allow any members of your association to interact with him her peacably demonstrate to try to convince others to disassociate themselves from the miscreants or whatever short of physical force but once you physically threaten or support physical threats you get much closer to your earlier comparison of rape with you as the rapist who whines she asked for it look how she was dressed blaming the victim when you are unable to be civilized doesn t fly dew dewey henize sys net admin risc hardware pager x

re death penalty gulf war in article e rusnews w w mantis co uk mathew mathew mantis co uk writes rush leland stanford edu voelkerding writes in article apr seachg com chrisb seachg com chris blask writes add to this the outrageous cost of putting someone to death special cell block years of court costs extra guards and the benefits of the death penalty entirely disappear that s because of your earlier claim that the one innocent death overrides the benefit of all the others obviously it s tragic but it is no argument for doing away with the death penalty if we went to war and worried about accidentally killing civilians all of the time because our determination of who the enemy really is is imperfect then there is no way to win the war yes fortunately we have right thinking folks like your good self in power and it was therefore deemed acceptable to slaughter tens or even hundreds of thousands of iraqis in order to liberate oil h h hkuwait we won the war hurrah hurrah the number of civilian iraqi deaths were way over exaggerated and exploited for anti war emotionalism by the liberal news media the facts are that less iraqis died in the gulf war than did civilians in any other war of comparable size this century this was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques which were technically possible only recently the idea that hundreds of thousands of iraqi citizens died is ludicrous not even hundreds of thousands of iraqi soldiers died and they were the ones being targeted or do you think that the us and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim iraqi civilians either the smart bombs didn t hit their targets and we know they did or they were targeting civilian targets which is hardly condusive to destroying iraq s military potential the military mission planners are not fools they know they have to hit military targets to win a war hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their tyrant dictator ok so some innocent people died yes maybe the unarmed civilians fleeing along that road didn t need to be bombed to bits perhaps that kid with half his face burned off and the little girl with the mangled legs weren t entirely guilty but it s worth the death of a few innocents to save the oil h h hlives of the kuwaiti people isn t it after all the iraqis may not have had a chance to vote for saddam but they showed their acceptance of his regime by not assassinating him right all that surrendering and fleeing along open roads was just a devious ploy we were entirely within our rights to bomb em just in case without finding out if they were soldiers how about all the innocent people who died in blanket bombing in ww i don t hear you bemoaning them war is never an exact science but with smart bombs it s becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian casualties sometimes mistakes are made targets are misidentified innocents die that s war the way it really is but the alternative to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth like it s one big rummage sale grabbing everything they can get is worse like patrick henry said some years ago i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death war is always the price one must be willing to pay if one wishes to stay free the death penalty was conceived as a deterrent to crime but the legal shenanigans that have been added automatic appeals lengthy court battles etc have relegated that purpose to a very small part of what it should be hence the question is do we instate the death penalty as it was meant to be and see if that deters crime or do we get rid of it entirely yes let s reinstate the death penalty the way it ought to be all that shit about fair trials and a court of appeals just gets in the way of justice let s give the police the absolute right to gun down the guilty and save ourselves the expense of all those lawyers think of the knock on benefits too la would never have had to spend so much money cleaning up after riots and holding showcase trials if the cops had been allowed to do their job properly a quick bullet through the head of rodney king and another for the cameraman and everyone would have been saved a great deal of unnecessary paperwork and expense after all if the police decide a man s guilty that ought to be enough the fact that the death penalty has been shown not to have any deterrent effect over imprisonment well that s entirely irrelevant mathew mathew your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off base here you come off sounding like a complete peace nik idiot although i feel sure that was not your intent so the iraqi war was wrong eh i m sure that appeasement would have worked better than war just like it did in ww eh i guess we shouldn t have fought ww either just think of all those innocent german civilians killed in dresden and hamburg how about all the poor french who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent we should have just let hitler take over europe and you d be speaking german instead of english right now tyrants like hussein have to be stopped his kind don t understand diplomacy they only understand the point of a gun my only regret is that bush wimped out and didn t have the military roll into baghdad so now hussein is still in power and the iraqi people s sacrifice not to mention the americans who died was for naught liberating kuwait was a good thing but wiping hussein off the map would ve been better and as for poor poor rodney king did you ever stop and think why the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape but the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and i have not seen when one makes a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evidence can be presented on both sides one has simply lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice a state of mind which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against but instead tends to support in the case against the policemen law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused whether they be criminals or cops one is not found guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of one s guilt and only the jury is in a position to assess the evidence and render a verdict anyone else is simply succumbing to verbal vigilantism regards jim b

re islam and scientific predictions was date fri apr gmt from umar khan khan itd itd nrl navy mil his conclusion was that while he was impressed that what little the holy qur an had to say about science was accurate he was far more impressed that the holy qur an did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in the traditions how would a man of th century arabia have known what not to include in the holy qur an assuming he had authored it well it looks like the folks in soc religion islam have loosened up a bit and are discussing this topic as well as the banking interest topic a few books on the subject have also been mentioned in addition to the one you mentioned these may be hard to find but i think i may take a stab at it out of curiosity i know the one film i saw on this subject was pretty weak and the only two quotes i have seen which were used to show science in the koran which i posted here were also pretty vague i suspect that these books will extrapolate an awful lot on the quotes they have at least one poster on the islam channel seems to have some misgivings about the practice of using the koran to decide what is good science i wonder if islam has ever come up with the equivalent of the christians creation science on any topic it would be interesting to find a history of scientific interpretations of the koran to see if anyone used the koran to support earlier science which has since been discarded it is all too easy to look at science as it exists today and then interpret passages to match those findings people do similar things with the sayings of nostradamus all the time anyway it is a rather unique claim of islam and may be worth checking

any graphics packages available for aix does anybody know if there are any good d graphics packages available for ibm rs aix i m looking for something like dec s gks or hewlett packards starbase both of which have reasonably good support for different output devices like plotters terminals x etc i have tried also xgks from x distribution and ibm s implementation of phigs both of them work but we require more output devices than just x windows our salesman at ibm was not very familiar with graphics and i am not expecting for any good solutions from there ari ari suutari ari carel fi carelcomp oy lappeenranta finland
re bw hardcopy of colored window mars ixos de martin stein writes i use xwd xpr from the x r dist and various programs of the ppm tools to print hardcopies of colored x windows my problem is i don t like xpr it gives at least the x r version does louzy output the hardcopy looks very grainy to me instead i use pnmtops this takes full advantage postscript and lets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a graylevel image to black and white dots so if you have a postscript printer try xwdtopnm xwdfile convert to ppm ppmtopgm to graylevel for smaller file to print pnmtops noturn to postscript lpr print pnmtops has several neat options but use them with care if you want your image to be wide use pnmtops noturn scale width noturn prevents the image from being rotated if it is wider than it is high width specifies the paper width not the image width see below scale is used because if the image is small it may fit within a width less than and will thus be printed smaller than wide if you first scale it up a lot it will certainly not fit in and will be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified paper width in short pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size but it will not blow it up automatically hope this helps marcel x marcel wijkstra aio wijkstra fwi uva nl x faculty of mathematics and computer science x university of amsterdam the netherlands life stinks fortunately i ve got a cold
re more gray levels out of the screen in article apr cis uab edu sloan cis uab edu kenneth sloan writes why didn t you create grey level images and display them for time slices by grey level images you mean items of bit images it does work but it doesn t work if you have more than bit in your screen and if the screen intensity is non linear with bit per pixel there could be c c timing this gives levels but they are linear if screen intensity is linear with c c it works but we have to find the best compinations there s levels but choises best must be chosen different compinations for the same level varies a bit but the levels keeps their order readers should verify what i wrote juhana kouhia

surface normal orientations some rendering programs require that all surface normals point in the same direction ie on a closed cube all normals point outwards you can use the points on the faces to determine the direction of the normal by making sure that all points are either in clockwise or counter clockwise order how do you go about orienting all normals in the same direction given a set of points edges and faces say that you had a cube with all faces that have their normals facing outwards except for one face what s the best way to realize that face is flipped and should have it s points re ordered i thought i had a good way of telling this but then realized that the algorithm i had would only tell you if you had points in clockwise order for a d polygon i d like something for d data any hints tips references would be appreciated steve where humor is concerned there are no standards no one can say what is good or bad although you can be sure that everyone will john kenneth galbraith these opinions are my own

re surface normal orientations in pscti aqe travis csd harris com srp travis csd harris com stephen pietrowicz writes how do you go about orienting all normals in the same direction given a set of points edges and faces this algorithm works well for me algorithm to attempt to find outward facing normals first mark all faces as unknown then create an edge dictionary that allows you to find all of the faces sharing a given edge where an edge is two integers representing the two shared vertices pick an arbitrary face and mark it counter clockwise using the edge dictionary orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of this face and recurse for all surrounding faces consistently orienting the entire surface find the average of the vertices in this surface using that point calculate a volume measurement taking into account the face s orientation if the volume turns out to be positive assume the faces are oriented correctly if it is negative reverse their orientations mark them clockwise if any faces are still unknown after this choose another face and go through the algorithm again at the end faces marked clockwise must have their indices reversed before facet normals are found note if you are running on silicon graphics machines and buy the iris inventor d toolkit developers package you have the source to this algorithm see usr src inventor tools ivnorm if you re not sorry i can t give out the source and even if i could it relies heavily on inventor gavin gavin sgi com

re point within a polygon in article apr uk bull co uk scrowe hemel bull co uk simon crowe writes i am looking for an algorithm to determine if a given point is bound by a polygon does anyone have any such code or a reference to book containing information on the subject regards simon basically there are two algorithms determining whether a point is inside outside or on the polygon the first one is ray or half line method in this method you can draw any ray if the number of the intersection point of the ray and the polygon is even then it is outside if the number is odd then it is inside of cause you have to deal with the special cases which may make you headache the second method is pi algorithm draw the lines between the point and all the vertices on the polygon calculate and sum the angles of the successive lines if the result is pi then it is inside if pi then it is on the polygon otherwise it is outside my experience tells the second method is relible hope this helps yeh usc

re hollywood hits virtual reality sorry i missed you raymond i was just out in dahlgren last month i m the virtual reality market manager for silicon graphics so perhaps i can help a little in article mar relay nswc navy mil rchui nswc wo nswc navy mil raymond chui writes hello the real reality our agency started to express interest in virtual reality vr so far we do not know much about vr all we know about are the hollywood movies the terminater and lawnmover man we also know something about vr from abc news magazine and computer graphics world magazine unfortunately while sgi systems were used to create the special effects for both terminator and lawnmower man those are film quality computer graphics rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time each frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on high end parallel processing computer systems thus that level of graphics would be difficult if not impossible to acheive in real time frames per second we certainly want to know more about vr who are the leading companies agencies universities what machines support vr i e sgi sun hp bim etc it depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is true immersive visualization vr requires the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from to newly rendered frames per second this is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training if the frame rate is too low the user notices the stepping of the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations additionally the frame rate must be constant if the system renders frames per second at one point then frames per second the next perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before the user can get heavily distracted by the medium the graphics computer rather than focusing on the data to maintain a constant frame rate the system must be able to run in real time unix in general does not support real time operation but silicon graphics has modified the unix kernel for its multi processor systems to be able to support real time operation bypassing the usual unix process priority management schemes uniprocessor systems running unix cannot fundamentally support real time operation not sun sparc not hp series systems not ibm rs not even sgi s uniprocessor systems like indigo or crimson only our multiprocessor onyx and challenge systems support real time operation due to their symmetric multi processing smp shared memory architecture from a graphics perspective rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real time multi sample anti aliasing of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today only crimson realityengine and onyx realityengine systems fully support these capabilities the anti aliasing is particularly important as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment what kind of graphics languages are used with vr gl opengl phigs pex gks etc you can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop vr applications but that is starting at a pretty low level there are off the shelf software packages available to get you going much faster being targeted directly at the vr application

virtual reality for x on the cheap hi everyone i thought that some people may be interested in my vr software on these groups announcing the release of multiverse multiverse is a multi user non immersive x windows based virtual reality system primarily focused on entertainment research features client server based model using berkeley sockets no limit to the number of users apart from performance generic clients customizable servers hierachical objects allowing attachment of cameras and light sources multiple light sources ambient point and spot objects can have extension code to handle unique functionality easily attached functionality client the client is built around a fast render loop basically it changes things when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user s viewpoint it also provides the server with information about the user s actions which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to other users the client is designed to be generic in other words you don t need to develop a new client when you want to enter a new world this means that resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting it the adaptations as will be explained in a moment occur in the servers this release of the client software supports the following functionality o hierarchical objects with associated addressing o multiple light sources and types ambient point and spot o user interface panels o colour polygonal rendering with phong shading optional wireframe for faster frame rates o mouse and keyboard input some people may be disappointed that this software doesn t support the powerglove as an input device this is not because it can t but because i don t have one this will however be one of the first enhancements server s this is where customization can take place the following basic support is provided in this release for potential world server developers o transparent client management o client message handling this may not sound like much but it takes away the headache of accepting and terminating clients and receiving messages from them the application writer can work with the assumption that things are happening locally things get more interesting in the object extension functionality this is what is provided to allow you to animate your objects o server selectable extension installation what this means is that you can decide which objects have extended functionality in your world basically you call the extension initialisers you want o event handler registration when you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback functions for the events that you want the object to respond to current events supported init move change collide terminate o collision detection registration if you want your object to respond to collision events just provide some basic information to the collision detection management software your callback will be activated when a collision occurs this software is kept separate from the worldserver applications because the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects from which to choose the following is all you need to make a world server application o provide an initworld function this is where you choose what object extensions will be supported plus any initialization you want to do o provide a positionobject function this is where you determine where to place a new client o provide an installworldobjects function this is where you load the world wld file for a new client o provide a getworldtype function this is where you tell a new client what persona they should have o provide an animateworld function this is where you can go wild at a minimum you should let the objects move by calling a move function and let the server sleep for a bit to avoid outrunning the clients that s all there is to it and to prove it here are the line counts for the three world servers i ve provided generic lines dactyl lines more complicated collision detection due to the stairs will probably be improved with future versions dogfight lines location this software is located at the following site ftp u washington edu directory pub virtual worlds file multiverse tar z futures client o texture mapping o more realistic rendering i e z buffering or similar gouraud shading o hmd support o etc etc server o physical modelling gravity friction etc o enhanced object management interaction o etc etc both o improved comms i hope this provides people with a good understanding of the multiverse software unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation and i m not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectified i hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of the virtual universe i ve certainly found fascinating developing it and i would love to add support for the powerglove and an hmd finally one major disclaimer this is totally amateur code by that i mean there is no support for this code other than what i out the kindness of my heart or you out of pure desperation provide i cannot be held responsible for anything good or bad that may happen through the use of this code use it at your own risk disclaimer over of course if you love it i would like to here from you and anyone with positive contributions criticisms is also encouraged to contact me anyone who hates it dev null and if anyone wants to let me do this for a living you know where to write thanks robert robert acsc com

re cylinder and ray in article qc fginnbv darkstar ucsc edu koehler secs ucsc edu writes i would be most thrilled if some kind person could help me with the following given a cylinder in d defined as a line segment between two points and a radius e g sx sy sz to ex ey ez and r what is the easiest and not too expensive way to find if a ray defined as another line through two points cuts through this cylinder and if so where i think the test for touching is rather simple if the closest approach of the two lines is less than r then the ray does penetrate the cylinder nope this won t work for a cylinder you can have a line arbitrarily close to the the cylinder backbone and yet not intersect it the test works for a pillbox though a cylinder with two hemispheres attached at the ends thanks ryan koehler secs ucsc edu arun

re sgi sales practices was crimson was kubota announcement my comment regarding dec was to indicate that i might be open to other vendors that supported opengl rather than deal further with sgi opengl is a graphics programming library and as such is a great portable interface for the development of interactive d graphics applications it is not however an indicator of performance as that will vary strongly from machine to machine and vendor to vendor sgi is committed to high performance interactive graphics systems and software tools so opengl means that you can port easily from sgi to other platforms there is no guarantee that your performance would be comparable what i am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck if your sales representative truly mislead you then you should have a valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local sgi sales management team feel free to contact the local branch manager we understand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers so give it a shot i m also annoyed about being sold several personal irises at a previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around for a while rather than being flushed as one of the previous posts stated the personal iris was introduced in and grew to include the d d d and d as clock rates sped up over time as a rule of thumb sgi platforms live for about years this was true of the motorola based series the pi the professional series the early d s the power series parallel systems individual cpu subsystems running at a particular clock rate usually live for about years new graphics architectures at the high end gt vgx realityengine are released every months to years these are the facts of life if we look at these machines they become almost archaic after four years and we have to come out with a new platform like indigo onyx challenge which has higher bus bandwidths faster cpus faster graphics and i o and larger disk capacities if we don t we become uncompetitive from the user perspective you have to buy a machine that meets your current needs and makes economic sense today you can t wait to buy but if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine ask the sales rep for one in writing if it s feasible they should be able to do that some of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them such as the performance protection program for older r based power series multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new onyx or challenge r based bit multiprocessor systems now i understand that sgi is responsible to its investors and has to keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line odd that i found myself pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books just before the end of the quarter but i m just a little tired of getting boned in the process if that s happening it s becausing of misunderstandings or mis communication not because sgi is directly attempting to annoy our customer base maybe it s because my lab buys sgis in onesies and twosies so we aren t entitled to a peek under the covers as the big kids nasa for instance are this lab and i suspect that a lot of other labs and organizations doesn t have a load of money to spend on computers every year so we can t be out buying new systems on a regular basis most sgi customers are onesy twosey types but regardless we rarely give a great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because again like a previous post stated if we pre announced and the schedule slipped we would mess up our potential customers schedules when they were counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date and would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our commitments the boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the entire grant period of five years and in some case beyond that means that i need to buy the best piece of equipment that i can when i have the money not some product that was built to paraphrase one previous poster s words to fill a niche to compete with some other vendor i m going to be looking at this box for the next five years and every time i look at it i m going to think about sgi and how i could have better spent my money actually your money since we re supported almost entirely by federal tax dollars five years is an awfully long time in computer years new processor technologies are arriving every years making a year old computer at least and probably generations behind the times the competitive nature of the market is demanding that rate of development so if your timing is really years between purchases you have to accept the limited viability of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor there are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live with but keeping customers happy is the most important so don t give up we

re virtual reality for x on the cheap hi steve as the author of multiverse i feel i had better respond to your mailnote questioning whether anyone had managed to compile this software the quick answer is yes the long answer is yes but a few have had a few problems with their platforms not all unix s are the same you know as far as many bugs go it would probably be more useful to everyone including you if you were a bit more explicit platforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are rs dec ultrix sun solaris so it is possible the main problem is that i don t have access to other platforms than the rs so if there are portability problems then the only way i hear about them is by people letting me know and giving me a clue as to how to fix it as far as the software not doing anything do you really think i would bother releasing it if that was the case perhaps you didn t read the few docs that are supplied the dogfight world is made up of clients only so if you re in there on your own then you re not going to see anything the dactyl world has quite a lot of scenary so if you don t see anything there then this is definitely a problem one final word if you re not interested don t bother with it if you are interested then please remember that i m not asking for any money so why not try a little patience and constructive criticism maybe that will get results robert robert acsc com

vga mode h routines available hi there i ve made a vga mode h graphics library available via ftp i originally wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself but perhaps someone here will find them useful they are certainly useable as they are but are missing some higher level functionality they re intended more as an intro to mode h programming a starting point the library assumes a processor but it is trivial to modify it for a if enough people ask i ll make the mods and re post it as a different version the routines are written in assembly tasm and are callable from c they are fairly simple but i ve found them to be very fast for my purposes anyway routines are included to enter and exit mode h define a virtual screen put and get pixels put a pixmap rectangular image with no transparent spots put a sprite image with see thru areas copy areas of the virtual screen into video memory etc i ve also included a simple c routine to draw a line as well as a c routine to load a color gif image into a buffer i also wrote a quick n dirty tm demo program that bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three windows the whole package is available on spang camosun bc ca in pub dos vgl zip it is zipped with pkzip g it is completely in the public domain as far as i m concerned do with it whatever you like however it d be nice to get credit where it s due and maybe an e mail telling me you like it if you don t like it don t bother mark morley camosun bc ca

re please recommend d graphics library f sorry about not mentioning platform my original post was to mac programmer and then decided to post here to comp graphics i d like the d software to run on primarily mac in either c object pascal think or mpw but i ll port to windows later so a package that runs on mac and has a windows version would be ideal i m looking for a package that has low upfront costs and reasonable licensing costs of course bobc

cview answers a very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in cview since he isn t in the position to post this himself he asked me to post it for him but to leave his name out so here it comes cview has quite a number of bugs the one you mention is perhaps the most annoying but not the most dangerous as far as i can determine it has to do with the temp files that cview creates cview gives the user no control over where it places its temp files it just places them in its current directory the problem you mention occurs as far as i can tell when it runs out of disk space for its temp files it seems as if cview doesn t check properly for this situation as cview decodes a jpeg it seems to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with bit colour information then for bit displays it does the dithering again writing another file with the bit colour information while it is writing this second file it also writes the data to your colour card then when it does the last chunk of bit data it recopies all the data from the bit file to your screen again it does this last recopy operation for its fit to screen feature even when this feature is not enabled the result of this process is the following if it runs out of disk space when writing the first bit file all you ever see is as much data as it has room for and the last bit of data is simply repeated over and over again because cview never realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes reads aren t performed if it has enough room for the bit data but runs out of room for the bit data you see almost all of the picture as it does the dithering and writes to the screen card however then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data from the bit file to screen for whatever reason it does this one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which there was room on the disk this is just a guess but probably fairly accurate at least the general idea is on track i think although i have probably made errors in details about file i o etc the way around this is of course to clear up sufficient disk space the temp files for large jpeg s x and bigger can be very large meg meg on some of the largest i have needed in excess of meg free disk space cview has a much more serious bug if you are trying to display a file from a floppy and you change floppies while cview has some temp file open on the floppy then cview in certain circumstances will write the directory and fat table i can t remember for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted floppy thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious possibly unrevcoverable way so be careful it is incredibly poor programming for a program to do this on the other hand when choosing files in the open files menu cview insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the hi lighter square incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once when it gets the directory info and really how much effort does it take to sort a directory listing with much thanks to the originator of this article rene walter renew stack urc tue nl will i drown in tears of sorrow is there hope for tomorrow will this world ever get better can t we all just live together i don t wanna live in strife i just wanna live my life i deserve to have a future the good girls future

questions about plane eqn method of hidden surface removal what are the main advantages of this method i have seen it described and the algiorithm seems a little bit long i developed my own method which requires that the points be in a counter clockwise order and returns whether you are looking at the back or the front similar to the plane eqn method it uses few calculations however basically it is several comparisons the only disadvantage i see is that it must be done after the transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the screen which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand my method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the screen are clockwise or counterclockwise when looking at the back of something the points occur in an opposite direction from the front so merely by figuring out which way the points go you can tell whether you are looking at the back or front of a d polygon has anyone heard of this method before it is so simple i doubt i am the first to think of it libertarian atheist semi anarchal techno rat i define myself tsa cellar org

re need a good concave convex polygon algorithm in article c juyz aly murdoch acc virginia edu rws v uvacs cs virginia edu richard stoakley writes we need a good concave convex polygon conversion routine i ve tried a couple without much luck please e mail responses and i will post a summary of any replies thank you richard stoakley rws v uvacs cs virginia edu the problem is not precisely defined above but if you need to find the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given polygon then you are seeking the convex hull of your original polygon there are two ways to do this use a somewhat tricky but by now well examined linear time algorithm that exploits the polygon boundary or just feed the vertices of the original polygon to a convex hull routine and accept o n log n both methods are discussed in preparata and shamos for example
re please recommend d graphics library for mac tsa cellar org the silent assassin writes rgc bcstec ca boeing com robert g carpenter writes can you please offer some recommendations it s really not that hard to do there are books out there which explain everything and the basic d functions translation rotation shading and hidden line removal are pretty easy i wrote a program in a few weeks witht he help of a book and would be happy to give you my source i think he wanted to avoid reinventing the wheel i would suggest that you take your code and submit it to comp sys mac binaries to be distributed including to the ftp sites many folks myself included would enjoy the extra code also quickdraw has a lot of d functions built in and think pascal can access them and i would expect that think c could as well if you can find out how to use the quickdraw graphics library it would be an excellent choice since it has a lot of stuff and is built into the mac so should be fast just to clarify the d routines that are mentioned in various places on the mac are in a libray not the rom of the mac a few years ago before i knew anything about implementing graphics i came across a demo of the apple grafsys d library and it actually did a lot however it is quite limited in the sense that it s a low level d library your code still has to plot individual points draw each line etc ad nauseum it has nothing on gl for example where you can handle objects other things to consider when talking about apple s old d grafsys library unsupported never was and no plans exist to do so in the future undocumented unless you call header files documentation if one knows something about graphics you could probably figure it out but i d assume there s better software available that gives better output and is at the same time programmatically nicer i e easier to program just my tax brent

software for image processing is a powerful system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in interactive times feature description disimp incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and spatial data options all functions can be easily accessed via the disimp executive this menu is modular in design and groups image processes by their function such a logical structure means that complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of modules processes include image rectification classification unsupervised and supervised intensity transformations three dimensional display and principal component analysis disimp also supports the more simple and effective enhancement techniques of filtering band subtraction and ratioing host configuration requirements running on unix workstations disimp is capable of processing the more computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times disimp is available in both runtime and programmer s environments using the programmers environment utilities can be developed for specific applications programs graphics are governed by an icon based display panel which allows quick enhancments of a displayed image manipulations of look up tables colour stretches changes to histograms zooming and panning can be interactively driven through this control a range of geographic projections enables disimp to integrate data of image graphic and textual types images can be rectified by a number of coordinate systems providing the true geographic knowledge essential for ground truthing overlays of grids text and vector data can be added to further enhance referenced imagery the system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels to determine their own working environment including the amount of help required disimp comes fully configured with no optional extras the purchase price includes all functionality required for professional processing of

processing laboratory s image processing system michael landy co wrote and sell a general purpose package for image processing which has been used for basically all the usual image processing applications robotics medical satellite engineering oil exploration etc it is called hips and deals with sequences of multiband images in the same way it deals with single images it has been growing since we first wrote it both by additions from us as well as a huge user contributed library feature description hips is a set of image processing modules which together provide a powerful suite of tools for those interested in research system development and teaching it handles sequences of images movies in precisely the same manner as single frames programs and subroutines have been developed for simple image transformations filtering convolution fourier and other transform processing edge detection and line drawing manipulation digital image compression and transmission methods noise generation and image statistics computation over such image transformation programs have been developed as a result almost any image processing task can be performed quickly and conveniently additionally hips allows users to easily integrate their own custom routines new users become effective using hips on their first day hips features images that are self documenting each image stored in the system contains a history of the transformations that have been applied to that image hips includes a small set of subroutines which primarily deals with a standardized image sequence header and a large library of image transformation tools in the form of unix filters it comes complete with source code on line manual pages and on line documentation host configuration requirements originally developed at new york university hips now represents one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image processing environments currently available it runs under the unix operating system it is modular and flexible provides automatic documentation of its actions and is almost entirely independent of special equipment hips is now in use on a variety of computers including vax and microvax sun apollo masscomp ncr tower iris ibm at etc for image display and input drivers are supplied for the grinnell and adage ikonas image processors and the sun sun sun and sun i consoles we also supply user contributed drivers for a number of other framestores and windowing packages sun gfx sun console matrox vip iti ip lexidata macintosh ii x windowing system and iris the hipsaddon package includes an interface for the crs it is a simple matter to interface hips with other frame stores and we can put interested users in touch with users who have interfaced hips with the arlunya and datacube max video hips can be easily adapted for other image display devices because of hips is machine independent availability hips has proven itself a highly flexible system both as an interactive research tool and for more production oriented tasks it is both easy to use and quickly adapted and extended to new uses hips is supplied on magnetic tape in unix tar format either reel to

general purpose packages i ve heard of besides what terramar has sips was written for aviris imagery i m not sure how general purpose it is you would have to contact goetz or one of his people and ask i have another piece of software pcw that does pc and walsh transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image modification you can compute an image using selected components i ve used it on megabyte aviris images without problems but for the best speed you need an external dsp card it will work without it but large images take quite a while times as long to process that s a freebie if you want it my favorite is idl interactive data language from research systems inc idl is in my opinion much better and infinitely easier its programming language is very strong and easy very pascal like it handles the number crunching very well also personally i like doing the number crunching with idl on the vax or mathematica igor or even excel on the mac if it s not too hairy then bringing it over to nih image for the imaging part i have yet to encounter any situation which that combination couldn t handle and the speed and ease of use compared to iraf was incredible by the way it s mostly astronomical image processing which i ve been doing this means image enhancement cleaning up bad lines pixels and some other traditional image processing routines then for example taking a

nfotis gis geographical information systems software grass geographic resource analysis support system of the us army construction engineering research lab cerl it is a popular geographic and remote sensing image processing package many may think of grass as a geographic information system rather than an image processing package although it is reported to have significant image processing capabilities feature descriptions i use grass because it s public domain and can be obtained through the internet for free grass runs in unix and is written in c the source code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the office of grass integration you then compile the source code for your machine using scripts provided with grass i would recommend grass for someone who already has a workstation and is on a limited budget grass is not very user friendly compared to macintosh software a first review of overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose image enhancement routines fft kelly maurice at vexcel corp in boulder co is a primary user of grass this gentleman has used the grass software and developed multi spectral bands volumetric rendering full color on suns and stardents it was a really effective interface vexcel corp currently has a contract to map part of venus and convert the magellan radar data into contour maps you can call them at or email care of greg vexcel com host configuration requirements if you are willing to run a ux you could install grass on a macintosh which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for satellite data grass is public domain and can run on a high end pc under unix it is raster based has some image processing capability and can display vector data but analysis must be done in the raster environment i have used grass v on a sun workstation and found it easy to use it is best of course for data that are well represented in raster grid cell form availability cerl s office of grass integration ogi maintains an ftp server moon cecer army mil mail regarding this site should be addressed to grass ftp admin moon cecer army mil this location will be the new canonical source for grass software as well as bug fixes contributed sources documentation and other files this ftp server also supports dynamic

basic geometry manipulations flip mirror rotate generalized affine rectification affine nd rd th and th order models as well as a projective model warp an image to a vector map or to another image rgb

complex histogram contrast control layer controller manages up to images at a time user can extract single bands from a band image or create color images by combining various individual bands etc the package is designed for a remote sensing application it can handle very large images and there is all kinds of other software available for gis applications host configuration requirements it runs on intergraph workstations a unix machine similar to a sun though there were rumors there are always rumors that the software would be ported to pc and possibly a sun environment pci a company called pci inc out of richmond hill ontario canada makes an array of software utilities for processing manipulation and use of remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard formats lgsowg bsq landsat and a couple of others whose titles i forget the software is available in versions for ms dos unix workstations among them hp sun and ibm and vms and quite possibly other platforms by now i use the vms version the pci software consists of several classes groups packages of utilities grouped by function but all operating on a common pci database disk file the tape i o package is a set of utility programs which read from the various remote sensing industry tape formats into or write those formats out from the pci database file this is the only package i use or know much about other packages can display data from the pci database to one or another of several pci supported third party color displays output numeric or bitmap representation of image data to an attached printer e g an epson type dot matrix graphics printer you might be more spe cifically interested in the mathematical operations package histo gram and fourier analysis equalization user specified operations e g multiply channel by add channel and store as channel and god only knows what all else there s a lot i don t have and don t use these so can t say much about them you only buy the packages your particular application interest calls for each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters read from a common parameter file which must be in vms anyway in your default directory some utilities will share parameters and use the same parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing setting up a series of operations the standard pci environment contains a scripting language very similar to ibm pc basic but which allows you to automate the process of setting up parameters for a common complicated lengthy or difficult series of utility executions in vms i can also invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure there s also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled language programs which can interface with read from write to the pci data structures database file parameter file the pci software is designed specifically for remote sensing images but requires such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the level where you can handle r s images you can figure out ways to handle a few other things as well for instance the tape i o package offers a utility for reading headerless multi band what adobe photoshop on the macintosh calls raw data from tape in a number of different interleave orders this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the graphic arts industry s ct t format would probably i haven t tried handle targa and so on above all however you have to know what you re doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start over it s worth noting that the pci database file is designed to contain not only raster image data but vectors for overlaying map information entered via digitizing table land use and all manner of other information i observe that a remote sensing image tape often contains all manner of information about the spectral bands latitude longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass all of this can go into the pci database i believe that on workstations the built in display is used on vax systems other than workstations pci supports only a couple of specific third party display systems the name gould deanza seems to come to mind one of my personal workarounds was a display program which would display directly from a pci database file to a peritek vct q q bus bit directcolor display subsystem pci software could be overkill in your case it seems designed for the very high end applications users i e those for whom a mac pc largely doesn t suffice although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time it s probably no coincidence that pci is located in canada a country which does a lot of its land resource management via remote sensing i believe the canadian government uses pci software for some of its work in these areas spam spectral analysis manager back in jpl developed something called spam spectral analysis manager which got a fair amount of use at the time that was designed for airborne imaging spectrometer imagery byte data pixels across by lines by bands a modified version has since been developed for aviris airborne visual and infrared imaging spectrometer which uses much larger images spam does none of these things rectification classification pc and ihs transformations filtering contrast enhancement overlays actually it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement stretching spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering the original spam uses x or sunview to display the aviris version may require vicar an executive based on tae and may also require a frame buffer i can refer you to people if you re interested pcw requires x for display map ii among the mac gis systems map ii is distributed by john wiley clrview clrview is a dimensional visualization

your correct e mail address to reply to what is jpeg jpeg pronounced jay peg is a standardized image compression mechanism jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard jpeg is designed for compressing either full color or gray scale digital images of natural real world scenes it does not work so well on non realistic images such as cartoons or line drawings jpeg does not handle black and white bit per pixel images nor does it handle motion picture compression standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named jbig and mpeg respectively jpeg is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn t quite identical to what you originally put in the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details aren t perceived as well as small details of light and dark thus jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans if you plan to machine analyze your images the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality you can make extremely small files if you don t mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc conversely if you aren t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression why use jpeg there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store bit per pixel color data instead of bit per pixel data making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images being able to compress a mbyte full color file down to kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time if you are comparing gif and jpeg the size ratio is more like four to one more details below if your viewing software doesn t support jpeg directly you ll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images even with a jpeg capable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance thus using jpeg is essentially a time space tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply it s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file i ll let you do the arithmetic yourself the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information bits pixel million colors instead of or less or fewer colors if you have only bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you within a couple of years though bit gif will look as obsolete as black and white macpaint format does today furthermore for reasons detailed in section jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images gif is superior in image quality file size or both one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to as a rule of thumb jpeg is superior to gif for storing full color or gray scale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material jpeg is superior even if you don t have bit display hardware and it is a lot superior if you do see section for details gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings in particular large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif jpeg can t squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects this sort of image is best kept in gif form in particular single color borders are quite cheap in gif files but they should be avoided in jpeg files jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pure black pixels adjacent to a row of pure white pixels for example sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in gif files borders overlaid text etc the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that s only a few pixels high if you have a gif with a lot of small size overlaid text don t jpeg it computer drawn images ray traced scenes for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity the more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same goes for semi realistic artwork fantasy drawings and such plain black and white two level images should never be converted to jpeg you need at least about gray levels before jpeg is useful for gray scale images it should also be noted that gif is lossless for gray scale images of up to levels while jpeg is not if you have an existing library of gif images you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg you will lose a little image quality if you do section which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif only applies if both formats start from a full color original if you start from a gif you ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg can only make things worse however the disk space savings may justify converting anyway this is a decision you ll have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section for hints be prepared to leave some images in gif format since some gifs will not convert well how well does jpeg compress images pretty darn well here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy a x full color image of a ship in a harbor the first three files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section b file size in bytes comments ship ppm original file in ppm format no compression bits or bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead ship ppm z ppm file passed through unix compress compress doesn t accomplish a lot you ll note other text oriented compressors give similar results ship gif converted to gif with ppmquant fs ppmtogif most of the savings is the result of losing color info gif saves bits pixel not see sec ship jpg cjpeg q highest useful quality setting this is indistinguishable from the bit original at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs ship jpg cjpeg q default setting you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original even with both on screen at once ship jpg cjpeg q this has slight defects if you know what to look for you could tell it s been jpeged without seeing the original still as good image quality as many recent postings in usenet pictures groups ship jpg cjpeg q jpeg s characteristic blockiness becomes apparent at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some still i ve seen plenty of usenet postings that were of poorer image quality than this ship jpg o cjpeg q optimize optimize cuts table overhead blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or indexing purposes note that this file is tiny the compression ratio from the original is in this case jpeg can make a file that s a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality the q file is every bit as good as the gif better if you have a full color display this seems to be a typical ratio for real world scenes what are good quality settings for jpeg most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings quality does not mean keep of the information as some have claimed the quality scale is purely arbitrary it s not a percentage of anything the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb the default quality setting q is very often the best choice this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image try q first if you see defects then go up except for experimental purposes never go above q saying q will produce a file two or three times as large as q but of hardly any better quality if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to q without objectionable degradation on the other hand you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg the default q is about right for compressing bit images but q to is usually better for converting gifs see section for more info if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are prepared to tolerate large defects a q setting in the range of to is about right q or so may be amusing as op art note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section b and to many programs based on it other jpeg implementations such as image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale some programs don t even provide a numeric scale just high medium low style choices where can i get jpeg software most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp if you don t know how to use ftp see the faq article how to find sources if you don t have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail servers in the same article that article appears regularly in news answers or you can get it by sending e mail to mail server rtfm mit edu with send usenet news answers finding sources in the body the anonymous ftp list faq may also be helpful it s usenet news answers ftp list faq in the news answers archive note this list changes constantly if you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest jpeg faq from the news answers archive a if you are looking for canned software viewers etc the first part of this list is system specific programs that only run on one kind of system if you don t see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet but some commercial programs are listed too x windows john bradley s free xv version and up is an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and other image formats it s available for ftp from export lcs mit edu or ftp cis upenn edu the file is called xv tar z where is the version number currently it is located in the contrib directory on export or the pub xv directory at upenn xv reduces all images to bits internally which means it s not a real good choice if you have a bit display you ll still get only bit color also you shouldn t use xv to convert full color images to jpeg because they ll get color quantized first but xv is a fine tool for converting gif and other bit images to jpeg caution there is a glitch in versions and earlier be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a jpeg file or the file will be blurry another good choice for x windows is john cristy s free imagemagick package also available from export lcs mit edu file contrib imagemagick tar z this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks the imagemagick viewer handles bit displays correctly for colormapped displays it does better though slower color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software both of the above are large complex packages if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release xloadimage is free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xloadimage tar z xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg files because it has the ijg v decoder while xloadimage is using a hacked over v the next xloadimage release will fix this xli is also free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xli tar z both programs are said to do the right thing with bit displays ms dos this covers plain dos for windows or os programs see the next headings one good choice is eric praetzel s free dvpeg which views jpeg and gif files the current version a is available by ftp from sunee uwaterloo ca file pub jpeg viewers dvpeg a zip this is a good basic viewer that works on either or machines the user interface is not flashy but it s functional another freeware jpeg gif tga viewer is mohammad rezaei s hiview the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics hv zip hiview requires a or better cpu and a vcpi compatible memory manager qemm and max work windows and os do not hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen for larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen rather than using panning scrolling as most viewers do you may or may not prefer this approach but there s no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably note installation is a bit tricky read the directions carefully a shareware alternative is colorview for dos this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives its user interface is also much spiffier looking although personally i find it harder to use more keystrokes inconsistent behavior it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview at least on my hardware for images larger than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than hiview the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics dcview zip requires a vesa graphics driver if you don t have one look in vesadrv zip or vesa tsr zip from the same directory many recent pcs have a built in vesa driver so don t try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing a second shareware alternative is fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but i don t know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel archives at that time the well known gif viewer compushow cshow supports jpeg in its latest revision a however cshow s jpeg implementation isn t very good it s slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is poor except on hi color displays too bad it d have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow shareware available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos gif cshw a zip due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine if you can t get any of them to work you ll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif then view with your favorite gif viewer if you have hi color hardware don t use gif as the intermediate format try to find a targa capable viewer instead vpic is reputed to do the right thing with hi color displays the independent jpeg group s free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics jpeg zip or jpeg zip if you have a and extended memory these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section b they will convert jpeg to and from gif targa and ppm formats handmade software offers free jpeg gif conversion tools gif jpg jpg gif these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format in particular you can t get bit color output from a jpeg the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsi s proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenet standard jfif format since hsi format files are rather widespread on bbses this is a useful capability version of these tools is free prior versions were shareware get it from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics gif jpg zip note do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet since it is not readable on non pc platforms handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package image alchemy this will translate jpeg files both jfif and hsi formats to and from many other image formats it can also display images a demo version of image alchemy version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics alch zip note about simtel the internet s key archive site for pc related programs is simtel full name wsmr simtel army mil simtel runs a non unix system with weird directory names where this document refers to directory eg msdos graphics at simtel that really means pd msdos graphics if you are not physically on milnet you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel there are several internet sites that maintain copies mirrors of the simtel archives most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead a popular usa mirror site is oak oakland edu which keeps simtel files in eg pub msdos graphics if you have no ftp capability you can retrieve files from simtel by e mail see informational postings in comp archives msdos announce to find out how if you are outside the usa consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel mirror is microsoft windows there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware due to windows system overhead note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window the newest entry is winecj which is free and extremely fast version is available from ftp rahul net file pub bryanw pc jpeg wecj zip requires windows and or more colors mode this is a no frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers but it s so fast you ll use it anyway at least for previewing jview is freeware fairly fast has good on line help and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format but it can t create new jpeg files and it doesn t view gifs jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but it s an excellent basic viewer the current version is available from ftp cica indiana edu file pub pc win desktop jview zip mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites including wuarchive wustl edu winjpeg shareware displays jpeg gif targa tiff and bmp image files it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter it has some other nifty features including color balance adjustment and slideshow the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note above file msdos windows winjp zip this is a slow compatible version if you register you ll get the only version which is roughly faster colorview is another shareware entry this was an early and promising contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg if you want to try it anyway the current version is available from ftp cica indiana edu file pub pc win desktop cview zip i understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with colorview for dos dvpeg see dos heading also works under windows but only in full screen mode not in a window os the following files are available from

shareware macintosh most mac jpeg programs rely on apple s jpeg implementation which is part of the quicktime system extension so you need to have quicktime installed to use quicktime you need a or better cpu and you need to be running system or later if you re running system you must also install the bit quickdraw extension this is built in on system you can get quicktime by ftp from ftp apple com file dts mac quicktime quicktime hqx as of this file contains quicktime which is better than qt in several ways with respect to jpeg it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file however some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt mac users should keep in mind that quicktime s jpeg format pict jpeg is not the same as the usenet standard jfif jpeg format see section for details if you post images on usenet make sure they are in jfif format most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format the first choice is probably jpegview a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format pict jpeg format or gif format it also can convert between the two jpeg formats the current version is a big improvement over prior versions get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app jpeg view hqx requires system and quicktime on bit displays jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers in fact it s the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over x pixels on a typical mb mac given a large image jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers you can zoom in on any desired portion though some people like this behavior some don t overall jpegview s user interface is very well thought out gifconverter a shareware image viewer converter supports jfif and pict jpeg as well as gif and several other image formats the latest version is get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac art gif gif converter hqx requires system or later gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeg gif viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images also the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images without quicktime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime but it s faster with quicktime note if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert then viewing the gif version jpeg convert a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities is available from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app jpeg convert hqx this will run on any mac but it only does file conversion not viewing you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v a jpeg gif converter based on an old version of the ijg code if you are using this program you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert apple s free program pictpixie can view images in jfif quicktime jpeg and gif format and can convert between these formats you can get pictpixie from ftp apple com file dts mac quicktime qt stuff pictpixie hqx requires quicktime pictpixie was intended as a developer s tool and it s really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface worse pictpixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix there is an old version of pictpixie called pictcompressor floating around the net if you have this you should trash it as it s even buggier also the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleaned up descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net storm technology s picture decompress is a free jpeg viewer converter this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without system or quicktime so you may be forced to use it on older systems it does need bit quickdraw so really old machines can t use it you can get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app picture decompress hqx you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to jpeg to allow picture decompress to open it if your machine is too old to run bit quickdraw a mac plus for instance gifconverter is your only choice for single program jpeg viewing if you don t want to pay for gifconverter use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg although not all can deal with the usenet standard jfif format adobe photoshop version or later can read and write jfif format jpeg files use the jpeg plug in from the acquire menu you must set the file type of a downloaded jpeg file to jpeg to allow photoshop to recognize it amiga most programs listed in this section are stored in the aminet archive at amiga physik unizh ch there are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one in the usa a good choice is wuarchive wustl edu look under mirrors amiga physik unizh ch hamlab plus is an excellent jpeg viewer converter as well as being a general image manipulation tool it s cheap shareware and can read several formats besides jpeg the current version is a demo version is available from amiga physik unizh ch and mirror sites file amiga gfx edit hamlab d lha the demo version will crop images larger than x but it is otherwise fully functional rend shareware is an image renderer that can display jpeg ilbm and gif images the program can be used to create animations even capturing frames on the fly from rendering packages like lightwave the current version is available from amiga physik unizh ch and mirror sites file amiga os gfx rend lha note although this directory is supposedly for amigados programs the program will also run under amigados or viewtek is a free jpeg ilbm gif anim viewer the current version is available from amiga physik unizh ch and mirror sites file amiga gfx show viewtek lha if you re willing to spend real money there are several commercial packages that support jpeg two are written by thomas krehbiel the author of rend and viewtek these are cinemorph a standalone image morphing package and imagefx an impressive bit image capture conversion editing painting effects and prepress package that also includes cinemorph both are distributed by great valley products art department professional adpro from asdg inc is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for amigas imagemaster from black belt systems is another well regarded commercial graphics package with jpeg support the free ijg jpeg software is available compiled for amigas from amiga physik unizh ch and mirror sites in directory amiga gfx conv file amigajpegv lha these programs convert jpeg to from ppm gif targa formats the amiga world is heavily infested with quick and dirty jpeg programs many based on an ancient beta test version of the free ijg jpeg software thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk of the month without so much as notifying the authors among these are augjpeg newamyjpeg vjpeg and probably others i have not even heard of in my opinion anything older than ijg version march is not worth the disk space it s stored on if you have such a program trash it and get something newer atari st the free ijg jpeg software is available compiled for atari st tt etc from atari archive umich edu file atari graphics jpeg bin zoo these programs convert jpeg to from ppm gif targa formats i have not heard of any free or shareware jpeg capable viewer for ataris but surely there must be one by now pointers appreciated acorn archimedes changefsi supplied with risc os version can convert from and view jpeg jfif format provision is also made to convert images to jpeg although this must be done from the cli rather than by double clicking recent versions since of the shareware program translator can handle jpeg along with about other image formats while older versions can be found on some archimedes bboards the current version is only available by registering with the author john kortink nutterbrink wj enschede the netherlands price dutch guilders about or pounds there s also a commercial product called jpeg which provides jpeg read write functionality and direct jpeg viewing as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options this is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs contact dt software freepost cambridge uk tel portable software for almost any system if none of the above fits your situation you can obtain and compile the free jpeg conversion software described in b you ll also need a viewer program if your display is bits or less any gif viewer will do fine if you have a display with more color capability try to find a viewer that can read targa or ppm bit image files there are numerous commercial jpeg offerings with more popping up every day i recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow in that case purchase a hardware assisted product ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final jpeg standard and about whether it can handle the jfif file format many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else s files b if you are looking for source code to work with free portable c code for jpeg compression is available from the independent jpeg group which i lead a package containing our source code documentation and some small test files is available from several places the official archive site for this source code is ftp

jpeg jfif format and image files in gif pbmplus ppm pgm utah rle and truevision targa file formats the core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs such as image viewers the package is highly portable we have tested it on many machines ranging from pcs to crays we have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use companies are welcome to use it as the basis for jpeg related products we do not ask a royalty although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature see the readme file in the distribution for details we hope to make this software industrial quality although as with anything that s free we offer no warranty and accept no liability the independent jpeg group is a volunteer organization if you d like to contribute to improving our software you are welcome to join what s all this hoopla about color quantization most people don t have full color bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware stores or fewer bits per pixel so it can display or fewer distinct colors at a time to display a full color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors this process is called color quantization this is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term we re stuck with the standard usage though clearly color quantization is a lossy process it turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings since jpeg is a full color format converting a color jpeg image for display on bit or less hardware requires color quantization this is true for all color jpegs even if you feed a or less color gif into jpeg what comes out of the decompressor is not colors but thousands of colors this happens because jpeg s lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray scale output incidentally because of this effect it s nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences i occasionally see posted images described as color jpeg this tells me that the poster a hasn t read this faq and b probably converted the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classified as color or gray scale just like photographs but number of colors just isn t a useful concept for jpeg on the other hand a gif image by definition has already been quantized to or fewer colors a gif does have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesn t allow more than palette entries for purposes of usenet picture distribution gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients don t have to this is also the disadvantage of gif you re stuck with the sender s quantization if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to re quantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full color image furthermore if the sender didn t use a high quality color quantization algorithm you re out of luck for this reason jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don t match the sender s display hardware jpeg s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user s display hardware furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of jpeg images you already have with a gif you re stuck forevermore with what was sent it s also worth mentioning that many gif viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines if you view a color gif on a color ega display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the gif one to display it but often it s also due to sloppiness jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed thus jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for low color resolution displays as well as high resolution ones finally an ever growing number of people have better than bit display hardware already bit hi color pc displays true bit displays on workstations and macintoshes etc for these people gif is already obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively thus jpeg is an all around better choice than gif for representing images in a machine independent fashion how does jpeg work the buzz words to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding this article s long enough already so i m not going to say more than that here for technical information see the comp compression faq this is available from the news answers archive at rtfm mit edu in files pub usenet news answers compression faq part if you need help in using the news answers archive see the top of this article what about lossless jpeg there s a great deal of confusion on this subject the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm i e one that guarantees the final output is bit for bit identical to the original input however this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offers much less compression at present very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist and all of them are commercial saying q to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step with the v free jpeg code you can also say sample x to turn off subsampling keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value it s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image at this minimum loss setting regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed bit per pixel image true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bit for bit accuracy if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with or more bits per pixel furthermore jpeg is public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents why all the argument about file formats strictly speaking jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations since we can t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem in the absence of official standards a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs aren t compatible with anybody else s the closest thing we have to a de facto standard jpeg format is some work that s been coordinated by people at c cube microsystems they have defined two jpeg based file formats jfif jpeg file interchange format a low end format that transports pixels and not much else tiff jpeg aka tiff an extension of the aldus tiff format tiff is a high end format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides tiff is a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of tiff it s not likely that adding jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpeg related products it s reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the tiff spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details even when tiff jpeg is well defined the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator tiff jpeg files may never be as transportable a particular case that people may be interested in is apple s quicktime software for the macintosh quicktime uses a jfif compatible format wrapped inside the mac specific pict structure conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward and several mac programs are available to do it see mac portion of section a if you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section for details another particular case is handmade software s programs gif jpg jpg gif and image alchemy these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi this format is not readable by any non hsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings use the j switch to get jfif output this applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif format by default you still should be careful not to post hsi format files unless you want to get flamed by people on non pc platforms how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software won t read it s likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg based format you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file a jfif standard file will start with the characters hex ff d ff e followed by two variable bytes often hex followed by jfif if you see ff d at the start but not the rest of it you may have a raw jpeg file this is probably decodable as is by jfif software it s worth a try anyway hsi files start with hsi you re out of luck unless you have hsi software portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they won t decompress properly with non hsi programs a macintosh pict file if jpeg compressed will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a jfif header scan for jfif strip off everything before the ff d and you should be able to read it anything else it s a proprietary format or not jpeg at all if you are lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d try stripping off everything before that in uuencoded usenet postings the characteristic jfif pattern is begin line m c x whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with begin line m i if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non jfif files what about arithmetic coding the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed the choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file on typical images arithmetic coding produces a file or percent smaller than huffman coding all the file size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm at t and mitsubishi thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies the fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best at least in the short run i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding the space savings isn t great enough to justify the potential legal hassles in particular arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future stay tuned for further details does loss accumulate with repeated compression decompression it would be nice if having compressed an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially unfortunately this is not the case in general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss i e you get an identical jpeg file even this is not true at least not with the current free jpeg software it s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first generation output it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change one of the things on our to do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but i am not optimistic about it in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full color output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff error degradation if you re wondering why it s because the pixel block boundaries move if you cropped off only multiples of pixels you might be safe but that s a mighty limited capability the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you don t want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while working on the image then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compression decompression time this way what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg as stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg if you can obtain the original full color data the gif was made from it s far better to make a jpeg from that but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you a chance to re do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary some gifs may be better left as gifs as explained in section in particular cartoon type gifs with sixteen or fewer colors don t convert well you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif so check the sizes too experience to date suggests that large high visual quality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to jpeg with least degradation don t waste your time converting any gif much under kbytes also don t expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from full color originals to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight through jpeg files would be i e shoot for or rd the size of the gif file not th as suggested in earlier comparisons many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant color border around a gif image while useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files it is not free in jpeg files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging if you are on an x windows system xv s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this cjpeg s default q setting of is appropriate for full color input but for gif inputs q settings of to often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation if you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher q setting may not be necessary color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the colors that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value the trouble with dithering is that to jpeg it looks like high spatial frequency color noise and jpeg can t compress noise very well the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you had it to get around this you want to smooth the gif image before compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a better looking output image than you d get without smoothing with the v free jpeg software or products based on it a simple smoothing capability is built in try smooth or so when converting gifs values of to seem to work well for high quality gifs heavy handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors if you can see regular fine scale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you don t want if you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package however cjpeg s built in smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality smooth is probably a good starting point for converting gifs but if you really care about the image you ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings for more information about jpeg in general or the free

re sphere from points i plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as i have working code which i will also include the intersection of planes method looks best but my implementation based on a short article in graphics gems i doesn t work i may be misinterpreting of course i had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor of dot and cross products but the former may actually be better in either case a matrix determinant needs to be computed implicitly in the solution of linear equations to get the planes i was taking the midpoint of the line from say p to p and setting the normal as the normalized vector from p to p these just plugged into the formula in graphics gems however the resulting center point is only occasionally equidistant from all of my test points for different tests my matrix vector math is very rusty but it looks like i need to verify the formula or use the simultaneous equation solution which will require bringing in another routine i don t have but should be easy to find another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by sets of points and intersecting the normals from there this would also define the circle center however small numerical imprecisions would make the lines not intersect supposedly planes have to intersect in a unique point if they are not parallel ed thanks to all who answered so far ed bolson university of washington cardiovascular research bolson u washington edu preferred bolson max bitnet bolson milton u washington edu if you must
sphere from points another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by sets of points and intersecting the normals from there this would also define the circle center however small numerical imprecisions would make the lines not intersect supposedly planes have to intersect in a unique point if they are not parallel having thought about this why don t you project the lines onto the d plane formed by the lines do an intersection calculation in the plane in d where you re guaranteed a unique solution unless they re parallel which won t happen in this case and then use parametric distance along the lines from the circle centres to determine the exact point of interest this bypasses the messy error propogation required to do the calculation in d hope i haven t put my foot in it again steve steven collins email steve crl hitachi co jp visiting computer graphics researcher phone hitachi central research lab tokyo fax

re removing distortion from bitmapped drawings in article apr sctc com boebert sctc com earl boebert writes let s say you have a scanned image of a line drawing in this case a boat but it could be anything on the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true x y positions are known now you digitize the drawing manually in this case using yaron danon s excellent digitize program that is you use a program which converts cursor positions to x y and saves those values when you click the mouse upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values this is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper errors introduced in the printing process scanner errors and what have you the errors are not uniform over the entire drawing so global adjustments such as stretching contracting uniformly over x or y or rotating the whole drawing are not satisfactory so the question is does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion in particular if i have three sets of points reference x y the known true values distortedreference x y the same points with known errors distorteddata x y other points with unknown errors what function of reference and distorted could i apply to distorteddata to remove the errors i suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a bumpy d surface solving for the surface and then flattening it to remove the errors in the other data points it helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion or at least a reasonable model of the class of distortion below is a very short description of the process which we use if you have further questions feel free to poke me via e mail assume locally smooth distortion compute the delaunay triangulation of your x y points this defines the set of neighbors for each point if your data are not naturally convex you may have very long edges on the convex hull consider deleting these edges now there are two goals a move the distorteddata x y to the reference x y b keep the length e as measured from the current x y s as close as possible to the digitizedlength e as measured using the digitized x y s for every point compute a displacement based on a and b for example a for x y points for which you know the reference x y you can move alpha reference x y current x y this will slowly move the distortedreference x y towards the reference x y b for all other points examine the current length of each edge for each edge compute a displacement which would make that edge the correct length where correct is the digitizedlength take the vector sum of these edge displacements and move the point alpha sumofedgedisplacements this will keep the triangulated mesh consistent with your digitized mesh iterate until you are happy for example no point moves very much alpha and alpha need to be determined by experimentation consider how much you believe the reference x y i e do you absolutely insist on the final points exactly matching the references or do you want to balance some error in matching the reference against changes in length of the edges warning there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be observed essentially you can t allow the convex hull to change and you can t allow triangles to fold over neighboring triangles both of these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of individual points or by periodically re triangulating the points using the current positions but still calculating digitizedlength from the original positions when we first did this the triangulation time was prohibitive so we only did it once if i were motivated to try and change code that has been working in production mode for years i might go back and re triangulate on every iteration if you have more compute power than you know what to do with you might consider having every point interact with every other point but first read up on linear solutions to the n body problem there are lots of papers in the last years of siggraph proceedings on springs constraints and energy calculations which are relevant the above method

outlining of spline surface about a year ago i started work on a problem that appeared to be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult i am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and hopefully some published solutions to it the problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines for inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional i e only extant between the edges but which exists in three dimensional space to draw the object we fit a cubic spline through the points each spline is effectively computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the curve each spline has an equal number of segments we assume that the nth segment along each spline is roughly but not exactly the same distance along each spline by any reasonable measure take each segment n along each spline and match it to the nth segment of the opposing spline use the pair of segments to form two triangles which will be filled in to color the surface depth sort the triangles take each triangle in sorted order project onto a d pixmap draw and color the triangle take the edge of the triangle that is along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge colored with a special edge color it is the edge coloring in step that is at the heart of the problem the idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface the net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface the reasons for this are fairly complicated they involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines if anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area thanks

re computer graphics to vcr getting an image from a computer monitor to a videotape is harder than it looks the standard vga and ega outputs are very different than the ntsc format used by televisions while there is equipment that will do the conversion it is hard to get your hands on and costs quite a bit if you have access to an amiga computer that has an ntsc output you can transfer certain types of graphic files by modem and tape them from the ntsc output unfortunately this would be frame by frame and would lead to unbelievably scratchy animation unless you had a good amiga animation program otherwise see if your local public access cable station has equipment that you can use

ellipse again hi everyone because no one has touched the problem i posted last week i guess my question was not so clear now i d like to describe it in detail the offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which rolls on the ellipse in other words the distance between the ellipse and its offset is same everywhere this problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used the tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the positions of the ball s center is the offset of an ellipse still an ellipse the answer is no ironically dmis an american indutrial standard says it is ellipse so almost all the software which was implemented on the base of dmis was wrong the software was also sold internationaly imagine how many people have or will suffer from this bug how many qualified parts with ellipse were will be discarded and most importantly how many defective parts with ellipse are will be used i was employed as a consultant by a company in los angeles last year to specially solve this problem i spent two months on analysis of this problem and six months on programming now my solution nonlinear is not ideal because i can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire or half offset it is very difficult to find the original ellipse from a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method i used is not analytical i am now wondering if i didn t touch the base and make things complicated please give me a hint i know you may argue this is not a cg problem you are right it is not however so many people involved in the problem sphere from poits why not an ellipse and why not its offset please post here and let the others share our interests i got several emails from our netters they said they need the summary of the answers yeh usc

xv problems please note the newsgroups recent discussion about xv s problems were held in some newsgroup here is some text users of xv might find interesting i have added more to text to this collection article so read on even you so my articles a while ago i hope author of xv corrects those problems as best he can so fine program xv is that it is worth of improving i have also minor ideas for bit xv e mail me for them any misundertanding of mine is understandable juhana kouhia clip deleted note that xv saves only bit rasterized images that means that the saved jpegs are just like jpeg to gif to jpeg quality also there s three kind of bit quantizers your final image quality depends on them too this were the situation when i read jpeg faq a while ago imho it is design error of xv there should not be such confusing errors in programs there s two errors xv allows the saving of bit rasterized image as jpeg even the original is bit saving bit rasterized image instead of original bit should be a special case xv allows saving the bit rasterized image made with any quantizer the main case should be that xv quantizes the image with the best quantizer available before saving the image to a file lousier quantizers should be just for viewing purposes and a special cases in saving the image if at all clip clip deleted it is limit of xv but not limit of design it is error in design it is error that bit quantized rasterized images are stored as jpegs jpeg is not designed to that as matter of fact i m sure when xv were designed bit displays were known it is not bad error to program a program for bit images only at that time but when bit image formats are included to program the whole design should be changed to support bit images that were not done and now we have the program violate jpeg design and any bit image format the program has human interface errors otherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any bit format without clearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use deleted clip some new items follows clip i have seen that xv quantizes the image sometimes poorly with best option than with default option we have the reason surely is the quantizer used as best it is surprise the same than used in ppmquant if you remember i have tested some quantizers in that test i found that rlequant with default is best then comes djpeg fbmquant xv our default in that order in my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly it actually gave image with bad artifacts i don t know is ppmquant improved any but i expect no so use of xv s best option is not very good idea i suggest that author of xv changes the quantizer to the one used in rlequant i m sure rle people gives permission another could be one used in imagemagick i have not tested it so i can say nothing about it clip clip some minor bugs in human interface are key pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer often it happens that i make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong place it is very annoying when you have waited image to come about five minutes and then it is gone away immediately the buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete also good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard and mouse for xv after the image is completed often it happens that image pops to the screen quickly just when i m writing something with editor or such those key pressings then go to xv and image has gone or something weird in the color editor when i turn a color meter and release it xv updates the images it is impossible to change all rgb values first and then get the updated image it is annoying wait image to be updated when the setting are not ready yet i suggest of adding an apply button to update the exchanges done clip

re coreldraw bitmap to scodal does anyone know of software that will allow you to convert coreldraw cdr files containing bitmaps to scodal as this is the only format our bureau s filmrecorder recognises jeff lyall i used this combination for a while a qcr z recorder i think and as far as i remember corel can export in scodal scd format just select export on the main file menu this may not be implemented in earlier versions of course in which case you re on your own also i seem to think that the s w for the qcr z at the time did strange and very undesirable things if any part of the pic was outside the screen area on corel i once spent an afternoon painfully discovering that one pixel had somehow strayed off screen causing my whole slide to be blank the qcr z also couldn t handle grad fill over grad fill so if you use a graduated colour background if you then grad fill an object on top of this the fill appears on the final slide as a circle i think and totally ignores the shape of the object being filled of course if the recorder isn t a qcr you can ignore all this and feel suitably cheers toby toby freeman glasgow university freemant uk ac glasgow dcs

the otis project ftp sites for original art and images the otis project the operative term is stimulate this file last updated what is otis otis is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork and photographs over the network for public perusal scrutiny and distribution digital immortality the basic idea behind digital immortality is that computer networks are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around near forever the gifs and jpgs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future perhaps they ll be put in different formats perhaps only surviving on backup tapes but they ll be there and someone will dig them up if that doesn t interest you otis also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your works a virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors suddenly life is breathed into your work and by merit of it s stimulus it will travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons spectators are welcome also feel free to browse the gallery and let the artists know what you think of their efforts keep your own copies of the images to look at when you ve got the gumption that s what they re here for where otis currently as of has two ftp sites projects otis the uwi site sunsite unc edu pub multimedia pictures otis the sunsite you can also gopher to this site for otis as well merely anonymous ftp to either site on internet and change to the appropriate directory don t forget to get busy and use the bin command to make sure you re in binary otis has also been spreading to some dial up bbs systems around north america the following systems have a substancial supply of otistuff underground cafe omaha lines cyberden sanfran usenet waffle iron how do you contribute what happens is you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely photo get it scanned into an image file then either ftp put it in the contrib incoming directory or use uuencode to send it to me email addresses at eof in email after the image is received it will be put into the correct directory computer originated works are also welcome otis directories house two types of image files gif and jpg gif and jpg files require oddly enough a gif or jpg viewer to see these viewers are available for all types of computers at most large ftp sites around internet jpg viewers are a bit tougher to find if you can t find one but do have a gif viewer you can obtain a jpg to gif conversion program which will change jpg files to a standard gif format otis also accepts animation files when you submit image files please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used in publications or other projects or if it is merely for people to view also include some biographical information on yourself we ll be having info files on each contributing artist and their works you can also just upload a text file of info about yourself instead of emailing if you have pictures but no scanner there is hope merely send copies to the otis project c o ed stastny po bx omaha ne i will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will scan them include an ample sase if you want your stuff back also include information on each image preferably a line description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where it s finally put if you have preferences as to what the images are to be named include those as well conversely if you have a scanner and would like to help out please contact me and we ll arrange things if you want to submit your works by disk peachy merely send a disk to the above address omaha and a sase if you want your disk back this is good for people who don t have direct access to encoders or ftp but do have access to a scanner we accept disks in either mac or ibm compatible format if possible please submit image files as gif or jpg if you can t we can convert from most formats we d just rather not have to at senders request we can also fill disks with as much otis as they can stand even if you don t have stuff to contribute you can send a blank disk and an sase or for disk postage and packing to get a slab o otis as of we re at about megabytes of files and growing email me for current archive size and directory distribution the images distributed by the otis project may be distributed freely on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way save to convert from one image format to another in fact we encourage files to be distributed to local bulletin boards and such if you could please transport the appropriate text files along with the images it would also be nice if you d send me a note when you did post images from otis to your local bbs i just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is it s the purpose of otis to get these images spread out as much as possible if you have the time please upload a few to your favorite bbs system or even just post this info file there it would be keen of you use if you want to use any of the works you find on the otis directory you ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the stipulations of the permission such as free copy of publication or full address credit you will either find this in the rm file for the image or series of images or in the artists directory under the artists name if permission isn t explicitly given then you ll have to contact the artist to ask for it if no info is available email me ed cwis unomaha edu and i ll get in contact with the artist for you or give you their contact information when you do use permitted work it s always courteous to let the artist know about it perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files naming images please keep the names of your files in dos format that means keep the filename before jpg or gif to eight characters or less the way i usually do it is to use the initials of the artist plus a three or four digit code for the series of images plus the series number thus leonardo devinci s fifth mechanical drawing would be something like ldmek gif or ldmek jpg or ldmech gif etc keeping the names under characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems creating image files when creating image files be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture this gives people a reference in case they d like to contact you you may also want to include a title address or other information you d like people to know hmmm that s about it for now more guidelines will be added as needed your input is expected disclaimer the otis project has no connection to the church of otis a sumerian deity or it s followers be they pope priest or ezine administrator we do take sacrifices and donations however disclaimer the otis project is here for the distribution of original image files the files will go to the public at large it s possible as with any form of mass media that someone could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain unless you ve given permission for that it s illegal otis takes no responsibility for this in simple terms all rights revert to the author artist to leave an image on otis is to give permission for it to be viewed copied and distributed electronically if you don t want your images distributed all over don t upload them to leave an image on otis is not giving permission to have it used in any publication or broadcast that incurs profit this includes but is not limited to magazines newsletters clip art software screen printed clothing etc you

canon copier printer postscript questions printer model and specification canon clc color laser copier ps ipu unit postscript intelligent processing unit hello we have recently purchased a very expensive and nice color copier printer we want to be able to print to it from our sgi iris network the copier printer has both a parallel and scsi interface i have configured the printer with the lp system using the parallel interface and can print postscript files to the printer i can also print rgb files but these are in turn converted to postscript by an internal filter the canon clc is a publication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts are less than acceptable we create the postscript files with a variaty of programs such as showcase xv and tops when we convert to postscript with tops and use the l option to specify the halftone screen density of rather than the default the output is better but still much less that acceptable note that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format and translating the image into postscript we suspect that if we could use the scsi interface we would get higher quality pictures we have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the scsi port to my knowledge this software is and does not come with a warranty the management here does not want to spend this much money without some assurance that the product will work here my questions if anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the scsi or parallel port what is the quality of the printouts is there a way to create high quality postscript printouts what is the limiting component the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on the printer the big question where can i get some software to drive the scsi port for this printer please email directly to me i don t not read news on a regular basis i will post a summary thanks in advance e mail scott ncifcrf gov phone title sr systems manager analyst

views on isomorphic perspectives i m working upon a game using an isometric perspective similar to that used in populous basically you look into a room that looks similar to the following xxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx x x xxxx xxxx x x xxxx o xxxx x xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx the good thing about this perspective is that you can look and move around in three dimensions and still maintain your peripheral vision since your viewpoint is always the same the routines can be hard coded for a particular vantage in my case wall two s rising edge has a slope of i m also using mode x x i ve run into two problems i m sure that other readers have tried this before and have perhaps formulated their own opinions the routines for drawing walls were trivial but when i ran a packed planar image through them i was dismayed by the jaggies i m now considered some anti aliasing routines speed is not really necessary is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed thus being assured of nice image or is this too much of a burden wall presents a problem the algorithm i used tends to overly distort the original i tried to decide on paper what pixels go where and failed has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared shape currently i take and produce line follows the slope line is directly under line line moves up a line and left pixels line is under line this fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels but it causes distortions has anyone come up with a better way perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap already skewed are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective i was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z buffering locations are stored in x y z form for those of you who noticed the top lines of wall and wall are parallel with its bottom lines this is why there appears to be an optical illusion ie it appears to be either the inside or outside of a cube depending on your mood there are no vanishing points this simplifies the drawing code for objects which don t have to change size as they move about in the room i ve decided that this approximation is alright since small displacements at a large enough distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in a real perspective drawing hopefully the context of the picture ie chairs on the floor torches hanging on the walls will dispell any visual ambiguity thanks in advance for any help till next time o o v o v email pinky tamu edu sam inala v

advice sought turning font outlines into renderable polygons i am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a postscript type or truetype font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted by a d scanline renderer i have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but have never had the need to implement such a system well i now have the opportunity to write some font rendering software so i would like to have some of my questions answered before i jump into the deep end the main problem i face is how to use the even odd or non winding rules to turn the outlines into a single outline polygon my renderer can handle complex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple polygons for example in the letter o there are two outlines the outside outline which is clockwise truetype font the inside outline which is counterclockwise one common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the two outlines are closest this is equivalent to descibing a polygon with holes the renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior polygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges i do not want to use this simplistic system since it will not handle all outline fonts properly it is not a simple matter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for some fancy fonts it does not properly handle the even odd or non winding rules from my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids as is done by the postscript and truetype font rasterizers these trapezoidal polygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the d scanline renderer my question is are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into polgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer i am not fond of this solution since it creates excess number of polygons another question for those in the know what is the best algorithm to create bevelled and or offset curves for font outlines i have a dozen papers on these subjects but i can t tell which method is the best to implement thanks for any pointers rob lansdale robert lansdale dynamic graphics project internet lansd dgp toronto edu computer systems research institute uucp uunet dgp toronto edu lansd university of toronto bitnet lansd dgp utoronto toronto ontario m s a canada

re windows on a ramdrive help f langleyrh ccsvax sfasu edu writes stuff del d for bandwidth s sake why sigh if you don t have more than mbs of memory using a ramdrive with windows is a waste of memory windows will access upto mb ram better as memory as to why what you did didn t work it is because driveletters and paths are stored inside the group pif ini files all of the sudden things went from drive c to drive e however if you wanted to copy an application up to the ramdrive and re setup it up that should work normally but as previously stated this will only hurt things unless you ve got more than mbs of ram and are using whats above as the ramdrive i personally have mb s of ram and run a mb ramdrive with a great deal of success however if you are looking to speed up windows the three things i ve noted that work the best are a graphics accellerator card a co processor even an emulator helps some other disk cache besides smartdrive i ve tried several and lightning for windows and norton cache give me major headaches as well i think the purpose the original poster was trying to serve is to avoid the significant amount of disk access that windows does on startup it s like it s trying to it s bit in wearing the damn drive out i estimate it s only reading a mb of programs data but from the performance the drive gives it sounds like they are scattered all over the drive my drive is however regularily compressed what is it that takes so much fuss perhaps if ms would take the trouble to optimize this startup process less people would be wanting to find a solution themselves

re ami pro and equation mode nagel ucsu colorado edu kurt nagel writes hi i m having a problem with amipro when writing equations if the equation extends past a certain point on a line the whole thing disappears if i then try to delete the equation or cursor beyond the equation ami goes nuts the line counter at the bottom of the screen increments repeatedly and the only way out is to ctrl atl del if i have been unfortunate enough to save a document with one of these screwed up equations the document is basically trashed although i have been able to fix them by going into an ascii editor and deleteing large chunks of the document has anyone else experienced this does lotus know about it and or have a patch thanks in advance kurt nagel fido colorado edu i contacted lotus about this problem today it has been reported previously and there is a fix apparantly the problem only occurs when tab characters are used immediately preceding the equation frame the work around when equations are expected to touch the right margin is to delete at least one preceding tab and use space to align the frame or use set frame where placed w no text wrap around unforutnately once the page run on has occured you are hosed so the moral of the story is use only space characters to align equation frames hope this helps the rest of you who have already contacted me with this problem kurt nagel fido colorado edu

re permanaent swap file with dos dbldisk in comp os ms windows misc you write while reading through the dos book it states that the windows permanaent swap file will not work correctly when placed on a compressed drive to make things compatable i removed my permanent swap file before starting the upgrade however when all the dust settled and i go into windows it says that the temporary swap file is right where it always was in the windows directory my question is how come the temporary swap files works ok with a compressed drive and the permanent one doesn t you might want to look in windows faq for this one but here is my best explanation but i can t guarantee that i m not way off base the permenant swap file is read written to by windows by talking directly to the hard disk controller card the controller card must use the protocal set up by western digital or something like that windows creates a file called spart par in your windows directory that points to that file it then uses the physical information about your disk to index to information in that file compressed disks are actually logical disks these disks have different characteristics than the actual physical disk furthermore the information on the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used i e it must go through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating system level or the bios level because of this inbetween program windows cannot use direct methods to read from the logical disk a permenant swap file is only there to reserve an area of the disk that windows can use and to block that space from dos windows would theoretically not even have to access the file from dos to use that disk space i don t know if it does or doesn t but it checks for it somewhere everytime you boot windows a temporary swap file is just a normal dos file that is accessed by windows via dos and the bios if a disk compression program or other tsr is loaded the file access must go through dos tsr s disk compression and bios in order to be access i e never use a temporary swap file never more on permenent swap files i m sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk has seen the message you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested size windows will only use the size suggested do you wan t to create this swap file anyway or something like that well a friend of mine robert called microsoft and asked them what and why what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and divides that number by then it checks for the largest contiguous block of free disk space windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers they also said that under absolutely no circumstances none will windows uses a swap file larger than the suggested size well that s what he said i call bull if this is true why does windows report the memory is available to me if it s not going to use it any takers james if this doesn t get to the net will someone post it for me thanks

gui application frameworks for windows hello i m investigating the purchase of an object oriented application framework i have come across a few that look good zapp from inmark zinc from zinc software c views from liant win from blaise some considerations i m using being new to windows programming i m from the unix x world the quality and intuitivness of the abstraction that these class libraries provide is very important however since i m not adverse to learning the internals of windows programming the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with the native one i don t believe arbitrary levels of abstraction just for the sake of changing the api are valuable since we will be developing for the bit windows nt system the memory management issues and issues particular to the windows api are less important we will probably buy another c class library something like tools h or booch components from rational to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff allocators etc so those features are not that important for this toolkit to have the two that i have narrowed it down to are zapp and zinc they seem to be the two toolkits that have received the most attention from the media i was wondering if anyone had any first hand experience with any of these toolkits especially zapp and zinc a couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are zapp seems to have the most extensive coverage of windows functionality and also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes has new fancy d style controls available and support for custom controls has a windows nt version essential redirectable graphics display output architecture useful for printing sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize seems to be the newcomer this could be an advantage in designing a better system zinc has a platform independent resource strategy not too important for me right now comes with a interface builder tool has a windows nt version essential seems to have been around longer more mature but grew up out of a dos version had a better demo both have source code availability options both are lacking ole support neither seem to have any particular support for multimedia type stuff any thoughts anyone has on this would be much appreciated thanks brett harper brett harper cimlinc com

re procomm plus for windows problems kentiler matt ksu ksu edu kent p iler writes i have normal procomm plus for dos but i ve been considering buying the windows version it got really great reviews in computer shopper i have a friend who connects to the mainframe and unix machines here using it but the screen seems to have a problem keeping up with the modem he has a modem on a mhz machine i can t see it having trouble keeping up his pcplus for dos works great re what to do after the high speed modem arrives edition apr this article applies only to windows and and not to nt os or dos apps not running under windows one of the unadvertised limitations of most current windows pcs is that their rs c serial com performance is seriously deficient almost everyone who purchases a high speed modem v bis v pep or hst discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept an incoming fax at after upgrading the modem overrun and retry errors abound even when the only active application is the datacomm or fax program if the transfer completes at all it may take even longer than with the old bps modem there are three reasons for the problem the universal asynchronous receiver transmitters uarts used in most pcs are primitive ns devices with single byte fifo buffers if the operating system driver cannot read and flush each character at high interrupt rates the next incoming character overwrites the fifo and the previous one is lost dos being a fairly single minded environment during datacomm can usually keep up windows can t windows has more operating system overhead than plain dos and interrupts often take longer to service overruns are much more likely than under dos as soon as you report to your pc modem vendor that you are losing data you may be advised that you need to upgrade to a more likely since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance about this issue you ll get no useful advice at all most of the store front and mail order sources i spoke with in attempting to solve my own problem had never heard the term and many didn t even know what a uart was even your pc has ns a uarts and ps s do or if you can upgrade your mother com board or add a new com board you may still experience errors and overruns because the standard microsoft windows com drivers don t take full advantage of the windows is improved in this regard over but i still recommend a driver upgrade applications like procomm win which is what i use cannot get around this problem by themselves if you have a modem card you may not have a problem as the modem part of the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the uart and avoid overrunning it however i wouldn t want to bet that the card designers were that clever and will insist on a uart if i ever buy a modem card some modem cards don t even have conventional uarts but if they are to work with standard windows drivers they need to simulate one use msd exe below to see what the modem card is or is pretending to be the hardware situation the uarts on most pc com ports are based on national semiconductor ns or ns chips or megacells inside vlsi chips where you can t replace them you can id the uart type on your system by running the microsoft diagnostic program windows msd exe be sure to run it in dos before bringing up windows the windows serial api may prevent msd from accurately identifying a if you run it from a windows dos prompt the ns uart has separate byte transmit and receive fifos with configurable trigger levels and can run reliably at clock rates up to bps although with current modem technology there s no point in pushing your luck by going over bps the has shorted access cycle times than the or the also has dma capability but it is not clear that any pc drivers ever use this for more technical info see national semiconductor application note an so what uart component do you have try to locate the uart on your mother board multi function i o card com board or isa mca modem card if you can t find a socketed component with the numbers or your com ports are probably buried in vlsi and you won t be able to perform a chip replacement if you can disable your vlsi com ports as i chose to do you can at least add an aftermarket com board if you have one or more socketed or chips you can buy plug in ns afn or pc c cn low power cmos version ics from several suppliers typically for to each the n chip is the normal pin dual in line package other styles are available but avoid any ns chips without the a the c c are presumably all ok early ns chips have bugs although national will reportedly exchange those of their own manufacture for free clone chips are available from various ic makers other than national the manual for the turbocom drivers states support for the following apparently equivalent chips national semiconductor a chips technology c texas instruments t c a silicon systems m vlsi c turbocom warns about the pre a ns and western digital c says that problems have been reported with early ibm ps sx and systems ibm reportedly will upgrade them if you don t have socketed chips you ll need to buy an after market com or multi function board if this is a modem card situation you may be hosed to add a new com or multi function card you ll need to either disable the com port s you are replacing or re assign them to com although watch out for irq conflicts without turbocom although cheaper cards are available in the interest of getting the problem solved quickly i elected buy the modular circuit technology mct aio card from jdr microdevices samaritan drive san jose ca voice us voice other fax us the mct aio and the is important sells for it is an bit isa card providing port type connector address and irq comments com db m com irq ns afn in socket com ribbon com irq ns afn in socket parallel db f lpt irq game ribbon the kit includes a ribbon cable and db f connector for the secondary com port a ribbon cable connector for the game port two bulkhead plates for the ribbon based connectors and a f to f adaptor cable each port can be individually disabled and the com ports have tx rx rts cts dtr dcd and dsr jumpers jdr also sells a super i o m f card that also has ide i have heard from several people about less expensive m f i o cards with s tsd systems for the card plus per greenfield trading and distributors voice fax their card is w one w and they sell afns for r s data systems inc east highway longwood fl phone fax com lpt game card w s for i have no personal experience with any of the firms except jdr meanwhile back at the mct card from jdr i only needed two serial ports and am running out of irqs on my pc so i disabled my built in vlsi based ports however with the turbocom driver below i could have set the internals as com and using irq sharing the software situation simply upgrading to uarts will not completely solve common overrun problems the standard ms serial drivers don t take full advantage of the the windows drivers are even less capable and the windows drivers have the following limitations they enable only the receive fifo and only at rates above bps they never enable the transmit fifo which results in an interrupt rate of x during uploads they set the trigger level at bytes too high it s easy for more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the fifo the ports menu of the control panel only allows speeds up to with a v bis modem sparse data and text can easily compress or more suggesting that a host dte connect rate of bps would be effective the api won t accept rates above cbr the api won t let dos programs know there is a there and even if it did dos programs that aren t aware get little benefit from a port with the standard drivers they don t allow irq sharing for com the bios doesn t initialize com properly in many systems windows provides no workaround for apps that don t provide port speed options above bps these problems are reportedly not solved in windows nt or dos and may or may not be addressed in any windows releases after but before rumors suggest they may be solved in windows you can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying a copy of turbocom current version from bio engineering research pacific commware division beacon hill lane ashland or voice fax bbs mcimail compuserve price was around as i recall bio eng is not set up to accept credit cards so i had to send a check egghead and software list turbocom but as far as i know they don t stock it bio is not a software company per se they apparently needed reliable hi speed serial connections for an in house instrument application wrote their own driver discovered a market for it revised it to be a general purpose com driver suite they recently upgraded it for windows it is run time licensed i now have my host dte connect rate set to bps most of my datacomm apps and i am having zero problems with downloads i routinely see transfer rates that exceed bps i am also using bps when linking an hp lx to my pc with lossless bi directional i o uploads to various remote systems are another matter because many hosts are still using antique uarts and drivers note that is still the highest rate that the windows port menu in control panel will allow in configuring a com port turbocom gets around this by allowing you to specify on each port a factor that will set the real uart rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the windows apis and dialog boxes i also have cts rts hardware flow control enabled and i suggest that you do the same even if you only ever transfer bit ascii data xon xoff is not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control the informal dec standard for xon xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another yes sixteen bytes after receipt of the xoff from the receiving system or device the byte fifo in the is clearly not big enough to let us rely exclusively on xon xoff a well respected datacomm engineer has informed me that the s can t really do cts rts all by itself in the dos windows environment so using data rates above may still be risky even with hardware flow control a with turbocom can still experience overruns in very busy systems with lots of apps running and serious swapping in progress if this is your situation you may need to buy a co processed com board but this will cost you more than a turbocom upgrade a review of two such boards and a review of turbocom can be found in the feb issue of windows sources magazine i suggest trying a turbocom upgrade first and experiment with process priorities and time slices if you are a power user whose thrashing system still runs into comm problems closing soapbox comments the state of rs c serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across the computer industry because it is the oldest standard i o interface the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer companies the design of the average serial port is at least ten years behind the state of the art in my last job with a major workstation vendor i lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the initial designs of a new system that family of machines was subsequently introduced with ports however this is the exception few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent i o you may as well learn what you can about serial i o because this situation shows no sign of improving soon when v fast arrives i expect cries of outrage from windows users world wide whose pcs sort of work today with v but will fail miserably with v fast without a hardware buffered uart like the and without software drivers that use that uart to best advantage a v fast

re is ms windows a mature os in article cyen ponder jesse writes hi have you used mac system x or x if the answer is positive you would know if ms windows is a mature os days ago people doubted that ms windows is not a real os i can see why they have such question ms windows confuses many people microsoft common complaints about ms windows deleted jesse e mail cyen cs unt edu ic sol acs unt edu hmmmm why do i get the feeling that this is gonna start one of those endless threads mac vs win and might even end up as os vs win well i dont know if windows is a mature os if i have seen one in which case that has to be x windows but dont be so quick to judge first of all to try to use plain vanilla windows is as courageous as to try to use plain vanilla dos there are lots of very nice commercial and shareware packages utilities that will boost up windows past what ms itself thought possible for example norton desktop for windows a replace ment for progman will give you group within a group capability and will even change group icons it will launch progs by association well fileman does that too or by dragging the file in the apps icon now mac doesnt do that huh and the list goes on and on now windows is kinda hard to finetune boost and configure but thats trhe price to pay for not paying to get a mac or an os capable machine an entirely differet story on the other hand if you dont like the idea of pm s icons not correspnding to the files themselves well they are not supposed to pm is a program launching utility not a file manager modify your settings to have fm as your shell and not pm or get a couple of utilities from cica that supposedly give you a mac feel i dont wanna get in the discussion which is a better system mac s are good in their own way they are different not better or worse than win pcs actually i am writing this from a mac lab as a user assistant so dont think i am partial to win by all means check out the stuff in cica ftp to ftp cica indiana edu under the pub pc win subdir user anonymous or wait for startrek mac s os on a pc the threads we are gonna have then just trying to avoid another mac win war costas malamas georgia institute of technology oit ua opinions expressed are not necessarily oit s internet ccastco prism gatech edu

any video gurus feel like attacking this quirk hi there i m having a bizarre video problem within windows i have a with a gvga video board i ve been using the standard windows vga driver with other similarly configured computers i am thinking that my problem is with the way windows refreshes it s screen the problem is that once windows has been envoked the colors start changing themselves at first i thought it was hardware but if you open a full screen dos program from within the windows session you don t have any problems until you get back to windows however when you initially return to windows the original colors get refreshed properly also it is not a uniform color change so if you are in solitaire the design on the back of the card maintains it s original color scheme but the white fronts of the cards will turn grey then blue etc the color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark purple ish black if you pop out to dos and exit back to windows the screen gets refreshed again if i don t log into windows and just do dos things from the novell network everything is fine i originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the other machine i had just finished configuring then from the net to this machine when i ran into problems i deleted everything on this machine and the net and tried bouncing it again when that didn t work i tried reloading windows to no avail any thoughts on things to check out i am totally baffled thanks in advance for any assistance and instruction linda cornell lcornell u washington edu uw office of research
re win nt what is it in article bcf c a deneva sdd trw com reimert etdesg trw com scott p reimert writes somewhere in this thread it has been said that windows nt tm is a multi user os as well as multi threading etc i certainly haven t seen this to be the case there are seperate accounts for each person and even seperate directories if that is desired i don t see an implentation of simultaneuos use though scott it certainly is multi user what i have seen from the march beta is that it doesn t yet come with the stuff which exploits multi user features i remember somebody from ms stating that it doesn t allow two users share one gui my interpretation of this was that one user per console but all the networking and rpc based stuff you want i believe ftp and rlogin deamons for nt systems will come from third party somebody already has a beta version of an unsecure ftpd on the net there is no reason why one cannot write a posix based shell like csh on unix for remote logins in general i liked nt when i checked it out it slow compared to win just like any other real os the beta version although being slow botts up much faster than my sun workstation windows subsystems also start up a lot faster than x windows i believe bill gates was right when he stated that nt was not for everybody after playing around with it for a while i was convinced if i owned a busines using a business computer from ibm or some other established vendor i would consider moving to nt platform because it would provide a much cheaper solution if you are running sql servers etc it provides the robustness such an application requires on the other hand if you like your dos games more or less forget about nt you can always boot to dos but in general that defeats the purpose of using nt most of nt s features are visible in a networked environment and in such an environment you can t reboot your machine at will for personal use i would rather wait for the win based windows release whatever you name it than jump to nt bandwagon i expect most applications will keep on using win until win becomes widely available sadun anik u of illinois at urbana champaign center for reliable and high performance computing e mail anik crhc uiuc edu

re using microsoft foundation classes with borland c in article qv rc fcp news cs tu berlin de make cs tu berlin de m kerkhoff writes hi all has anybody tried to compile ctrltest from the mfc samples directory after compiling the mfc libs with bwc seems to me that bwc isn t able to distinguish pointers to overloaded functions for example imagine the following overloaded functions void same name void void same name int after trying the whole day i think with bwc its impossible to take the adress of one of the above two functions and assign it to a properly defined function pointer am i right has anybody else had this problem thanx i think you may be chasing the wrong problem i don t think it is the function overloading at all i do that sort of thing all of the time in bc without a hitch the big problems i have encountered in porting mfc to bc is that fact that mfc depends on a couple of invalid c assumptions i have never gotten the entire ctrltest app to run under bc but the reason is that ms makes some bad assumptions about the order in which static global objects are initialized i e some objects are getting accessed before they are initialized the problem is in the owner draw menu code somewhere if you comment out that section all other pieces of ctrltest work fine two other major gotchas i have found using mfc under bc the cfile openflags enum uses hard coded numbers for the open mode rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl h which differ between msc and bc all of the mfc collection classes depend on another bad c assumption that a reference to a base object can used be in place of a reference to a derived object true for pointers not for references i am sure there are other problems along the same lines but i have not encountered them yet i have not seen mfc yet but i hope that some of these will be addressed if they are not all of ms s hype about portability to other vendor s compilers will be just that if these were my employer s opinions i wouldn t be posting them whoever said nothing lasts forever was obviously r brendler not a cubs fan mike royko spss inc chicago il

re color or monochrome walther i d have a look at the maximum resolution the combination of the video card and screen would have without flickering i d only suggest using the color screen if it does without flickering if this is not too small for your tastes at a personally i d prefer the mono screen as i always have quite a few windows open if you only run one program at a time or rarely switch maybe the color surplus is worth trading in the smaller size if you want to develop programs you will always have to check the colors i used a mono screen worst of both worlds and was surprised how the colors looked i choose on a color screen regards olaf winkelhake

re quicken vs tobias managing your money in article apr twg com q twg com michael wiesenberg writes anyway is anyone aware of a comparitive study of the two programs or can someone just give me their own personal impressions maybe pc magazine january had a review of several personal finance management programe as did pc computing january pc world december also had articles about quicken and managing your money i can email you copies of these articles if you can t find them at your library i ve been using managing your money for several years and i have several friends who use quicken though i ve not used it myself my overall impression is that quicken is a financial accounts manager while managing your money will help you more completely manage your finances here are some features that i believe managing your money and quicken share the ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts checking savings charge cash or brokerage you can reconcile your account statements with the records the program keeps the ability to make a budget and track your spending against that budget a checkfree module which will allow you to use the checkfree bill paying service to pay your bills via your modem the ability to print checks on your printer the ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments the ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts up to date i know managing your money can do this automatically via modem quicken probably can as well but i m not sure about it the ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation programs here are some features that i believe managing your money has that quicken does not a tax prediction module this looks at your accounts and budget to predict your tax liability for the coming year it s usefull to fine tune your withholding so uncle sam doesn t get his due too early an insurance and vital records module this is a place to keep records of your insurance policies as well as other vital records it can also compute your life expectancy a financial analysis module this computes compound interest effects of inflation loan payments term or interest yield to maturity for bonds savings account yields days between dates and loan amortization schedules it also has functions to help you decide whether to refinance your mortgage whether you can afford a particular home whether a particular rental property is a good investment whether you should buy lease or rent and whether a particular investment s cash flow is adequate for your situation this module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping your kids with their tuition a net worth module this is a place to record all your assets and liabilities your net worth can be computed from this information any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules are automatically included here a desk module this includes a small word processor a card file you can use to store names addresses phone numbers and other vital information about friends and associates a perpetual calander a rudimentary calculator a to do list a reminder list an appointment list and a place to record your phone calls for those who need to track such things your appointments reminders and to do list can be made to display automatically when you start the program there are probably some things listed above that quicken has but i m almost sure that quicken doesn t do everything i ve listed if i m wrong i m sure hordes of quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp one thing that quicken has that managing your money does not yet have is a windows version meca software is rumored to be working on a windows version of managing your money for release late this year i hope this information is of use to you i ve found managing your money to be a very usefull program for keeping my financial records on the other hand i know many people who are equally as happy with quicken if quicken has all the features you need or want i d go with it if you find any of the managing your money features that quicken doesn t have to be useful i think it s well worth the price

re is ms windows a mature os in article cyen ponder jesse writes hi have you used mac system x or x if the answer is positive you would know if ms windows is a mature os this is silly is unix a mature os depends on who you ask and how you define mature system is if anything less mature than windows days ago people doubted that ms windows is not a real os i can see why they have such question ms windows confuses many people microsoft simulated mac but it did a lousy job for example you can not create hierarchy groups there is no way to create a group in a group if you know how please tell me so why do you need something like behierarchic to create groups under the apple menu everyone knows that apple menu items are a ripoff of the program manager if you want a hierarchic program launcher there are lots available uncomplete documentation it s not easy to find the reason why causes an unpredictable error and this is easy on a mac give me a break having spent hours moving system extensions around and restarting the mac to see why a certain app crashes all the time i find this laughable group deleting file deleting after deleting a group users have to use file manager to delete files but if users forget to delete some related files the disk will be full of nonsense files oh great ever hear of aliases wonder why apple implemented them share problem once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some language w o good editor there will be a sharing problem you just can not open or save the program if it is loaded it makes sense to prevent from saving but not opening eh i don t follow it s by no means easy to satisfy everybody but if microsoft want to keep their reputations they should evaluate the user interface more carefully before products distribute why is it that i find the mac desktop incredibly annoying whenever i use it no flame please yeah right you post flame bait yet ask for no flames iskandar taib the only thing worse than peach ala internet ntaib silver ucs indiana edu frog is frog ala peach bitnet ntaib iubacs

re gatewaying microsoft mail workgroups via we here at utah state university cooperative extension have been using w wg for a while now we wanted to talk to the internet with the mail package so we got the smtp gateway you also need a tcp ip transport package on top of that which is utterly stupid but that s what they require to get the smtp gateway to work you need a dedicated pc for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff we do not have the remote mail going but you indicate that that is what you want to do there is a glitch somewhere in the system though i don t know if it is ms mail the gateway or the vax here on campus that is choking in the mail that is sent the scenario is this the outgoing mail goes to a unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go if that mail is routed to the vax the vax has problems some times receiving the mail most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail on the vax forwarded to some other location that is the main gotcha where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header then a message saying boudary error garbage code stuff if you can stay away from sending to a vax you are ok the system people of course say that the vax is not the problem the gateway is probably the problem if anyone wants to get help it is only for one support call until problem is worked out phooey to that i say i am looking vigorously for a better idea if you go forward on any of this and find out anything knew please drop me a note anyone the next itteration is supposed to have tcp ip built in they say the netxt itteration of w wg good luck wes james email wesj extsparc agsci usu edu utah state university cooperative extension systems specialist umc voice logan ut fax

re utility for updating win ini and system ini in article apr oz plymouth edu oddjob oz plymouth edu andrew c stoffel writes in article apr midway uchicago edu am midway uchicago edu writes unless i am completely misunderstanding you try using either notepad or sysedit exe found in your system subdirectory to edit you ini files you can add sysedit regedit to a program group they are windows programs the sysedit exe program is cool because it automatically opens you win ini system ini autoexec bat and config sys files to be edited is it possible to get it to load other ini files no when the program is run it loads configuration files autoexec bat config sys win ini and system ini there is no open entry on the file menu you can only edit these four files if you need to edit some other program s ini file use notepad or some other ascii editor i wonder whether microsoft intended for sysedit to be used or if it was just a holdover from the testing period and they forgot to take it out the reason i think this is because there is absolutely no mention in the manuals about this program and there is no online help for it just an about entry under the file menu the program looks like something that was intended for internal use only it s kind of a shame though it would have made a nice multi file replacement for notepad daniel silevitch dmsilev athena mit edu massachusetts institute of technology

black screen of death windows novell hi there we are running a node token ring with windows and novell every once in a while we run into the black screen of death a phrase coined by robert x cringely in a recent infoworld column basically sometimes when you quit windows the screen goes black and you get a nice little flashing cursor in the top left corner of your screen also sometimes when you exit to dos the same effect occurs cringely hints that microsoft and or novell has a patch for windows virtual interrupt controller that may solve this neither company seems to know what i am talking about when i call them has anyone else noticed this phenomenon is there a fix for it any response is welcome peter sweeney psweeney miavx acs muohio edu

mathcad swap file reposting and summarizing for your information or additional comment this is long i have mb of memory on my sx mhz an intel math coprocessor and a mb hard drive with mb free no compression i have been running mathcad under windows in enhanced mode with a mb ram drive mb mb smart drive and no swap file permanent or temporary for several months i am interested in the faster mathcad but i am concerned about reported swap file requirements and the legitimacy of mathsoft s claim about increased speed to sx users will mathcad run without a swap file or insist that i use a swap file so far in response to a less detailed description of my setup or in unrelated postings the more informed answers on the net or by e mail appear to be by fuess llnl gov david a fuess according to mathsoft no mathcad uses the swap file extensively so as not to overburden the physical resources they say this is actually a win s feature a figure of mb was indicated to me as a minimum but you might try anyway by bert tyler satalink com bert tyler i m not all that certain that mathcad is the culprit here i have a dx with mb of main memory less mb for a ramdisk and a bit for a dos session that is opened as part of the startup process which i have been running without any swapfile when i installed the win s subsystem from the march beta of the nt sdk the win s subsystem itself demanded the presence of a swapfile the only win s program i ve run to date is the bit version of freecell that came with that subsystem i gave windows a small temporary swapfile i m leery of files that must remain in fixed locations on my hard disk and all seems well by bca ece cmu edu brian c anderson what is win i upgraded to mathcad and it installed a directory for win under windows system during the upgrade it told me that win was required by case student tc umn edu steven v case mathcad makes use of the win s libraries you ve probably heard about win s it is a bit windows library that provides much of the windows nt functionality no support for threads and multitasking and such but can be run under windows by rhynetc zardoz chem appstate edu thomas c rhyne i also have mb of ram and indeed mathcad insisted on a permanent swapfile it would not run otherwise by bishop baeyer chem fsu edu greg bishop mathcad absolutely requires mb ram with mb swap file or mb ram with mb swap file it will give you a not enough memory error if the swap file is less than mb it is a major resource hog if you do not load the symbolic processor or the smart math it takes about mb of ram real or virtual just to load again due to the win s libraries so it seems that in addition to the system requirements shown on mathsoft s advertisement for that you need a swap file possibly as big as mb looks like i would just need an mb swap file and would need to choose or can i between a faster permanent swap file or a slower temporary swap file apparently a win subsystem ships with mathcad how much disk space does this require i also received these answers by mfdjh uxa ecn bgu edu dale hample if you ve got megs of ram why not configure megs as a ram disk for mathcad dos permits different bootup configurations can mathcad win be configured to use such a ram drive instead of a swap file if not i don t see how using dos for an alternate bootup would provide windows with this swap file some time back i remember a discussion about the issues of using a ram drive to support a swap file but i thought this involved slower mb systems i have dos but for various reasons have not yet done a full installation by the way is a full installation of dos required to avail oneself of the alternate bootup feature which files from the installation disks are required by wild access digex com wildstrom presumeably you mean without a permanent swap file if windows needs a swap file it will upo and create one if a permanent one doesn t exist permanent is generally faster though i don t know why mathcad wouldn t be happy with either type ver is and so should any program conforming to the win specification so far mb has been enough ram to avoid the overhead of running any swap file i have been running mathcad under windows without one
re win nt what is it can anyone tell me how chicago windows would differ from os x believe it or not i m not trying to start a flame war here i m simply curious if there is going to be any feature advantage in either of these products i do not consider the fact that it has uncle bills seal of approval much of a feature one difference will probably be the same difference as between os and windows x now one will likely have a lot of software available for it and one won t emulation with the inevitable incompatibilities that crop up in spite of all the contrary claims just doesn t count when you have to use a certain software package that doesn t quite run properly under the emulation developers want to channel their resources toward a platform that has a large installed base and in a case like that the platform that is most successfully marketed regardless of its relative sophistication will win lamont downs downs nevada edu

re save my hard disk allocation error cross linked brad banko writes while running the ms quick c compiler in a dos window under windows this evening i got a program has violated system integrity close all applications exit windows and restart your computer error gawd i love windows is there an easy way to restore everything to working order what might be some better approaches you ll probably want to delete any damaged executables and reload them fresh data files should be examined and repaired what might have caused this does the smartdrv cache make me more vulnerable i m suspicious of hard drive caches especially when they cache data writing you re not stupid smartdrive caches things and windows also runs a swap file which may contain data also all of this is pretty risky stuff in a pc environment the straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the f option to fix the disk and then it looks like i would probably have to reinstall windows and a few other things a reasonably accurate prediction here s a brief description of how dos stores files there are three pieces to a file the directory entry the fat chain and the data area you can think of these as a sheet of lined notebook paper a sheet of graph paper and a stack of x cards the directory entry notebook paper holds the file name actual size and first cluster number it also holds some other information that s not important right now the file allocation table fat chain graph paper tells where to find the actual data each square of graph paper holds a number if the number is zero the cluster associated with this box is available if it holds a magic number it is either the last piece of a file or a bad unuseable spot on the disk any other number tells which cluster contains the next section of the file the data area x cards is where the actual information is stored the data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size storage is doled out in chunks of one cluster each in your case one cluster is bytes as a cluster is filled another is allocated to read a file you first look at the directory entry to get the starting cluster number now you read the data from that cluster next look at the fat entry for the cluster you just read this will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file naturally these numbers are usually sequential but they can jump around and even go backwards continue reading one cluster at a time as you walk this chain through the fat until you hit the marker which says it s the last cluster in the file chkdsk is the dos utility that checks the sanity and coherence of the directories and the fat and can bludgeon most flaws into submission it doesn t have any intelligence so you have to double check anything it fixes now let s do a bit of a post mortem c gfx vpic cvpic exe c gfx vpic vpic txt c gfx vpic video cfg c gfx vpic orcpro cfg c gfx vpic vga cfg c game goose bird x c winmisc adv winadv exe allocation error size adjusted all of these files have sizes according to the fat which don t match the size reported in their directory entries chkdsk f will alter the directory entries to match the fat size in other words the directory entry for cvpic exe may say the file is bytes long but chkdsk found a fat chain of clusters attached to it my numbers obviously are made up lost allocation units found in chains bytes disk space would be freed disk space was found which is allocated in the fat but is not attached to any directory entry chkdsk f gives you the option of converting these lost chains to files you can then examine the files file chk through file chk and rename or discard them or if you tell chkdsk not to convert them to files then those clusters will simply be marked available in the fat c gfx vpic cvpic exe is cross linked on allocation unit c spart par is cross linked on allocation unit these files are both referencing the same data cluster obviously one of them at least must be wrong it s interesting to note that c spart par is your windows swap file to fix this you should copy each cross linked file to a new name this will fix the cross link by giving the files unique data spaces now delete the cross linked files examine the copies and try to assemble them properly good luck hint missing pieces are likely to be found in those lost chains at the top bytes total disk space bytes in hidden files bytes in directories bytes in user files bytes available on disk your disk is pretty close to full this may be the actual cause of the problem perhaps windows needed to expand its swapfile by an amount which exceeded available disk space in any case the short summary is that something trashed your fat there are utilities that can mirror your fat and help repair damage after something like this but you have to run them before the problem occurs sorry gordon s hlavenka cgordon vpnet chi il us vote straight ticket procrastination party dec rd gordon s hlavenka cgordon vpnet

summary ati graphics ultra questions etc to those interested in the new ati ultra cards i had posted some questions regarding the new ati ultra pro cards and had asked confirmation of some opinions this message is a summary of the responses thanks to all of you that replied the card does not work in a system with m ram a the higher memory limits apply to isa cards only as far as i know the vlb and eisa version should have no problems b i m pretty sure from my experience that the isa version doesn t work in systems with over m ram there is supposed to be way of switching the memory aperture feature off to prevent this but apparently it doesn t work i posted some help me messages on the net and people indicated that the eisa card didn t have this problem c false d the vlb card which i have allows you to set memory aperture over m by using their configuration software no messing with jumpers necessary the m problem is probably valid only for isa cards the card works in a m system with some switches set but it is much slower a again the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than m ram eisa and vlb or m isa m should not be a problem for you b dunno c depends on the bus yes if isa no if eisa or localbus the card is interlaced in its bit true colour modes a nope i can use x at hz bit and x at hz bit all non interlaced b yes according to pc magazine they ve tested a local bus version that does x in bit which may or may not be interlaced c not for the pro sometimes for the plus some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors this has nothing to do with bits only with screen size note that for bit color and windows you must have megs memory size calculations notwithstanding the latest build drivers still do not work in many cases a they aren t perfect but are much improved i don t recall the last time which i had to leave mach mode ati gup mode and switch to or vga mode due to software incompatibility b true many people recommended going back to build or c they appear to be excellent but have a few bugs for example certain graphs with dashed lines in mathcad do not print correctly though they do display ok on the screen they are about par for fancy cards other accelerated cards also have bugs d overall i like the card even if driver performance is somewhat less than satisfactory i am running the color mode as that is all my nt driver for october nt version seems to allow i will say this that color performance is not quite as nice as a diamond stealth vram but i have not been able to try out a lot of the options on the old driver this card is the fastest full colour card for the money a it s quite fast but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate b yes i ll admit it was very very fast in bit mode which is what i wanted to use it for too bad it crashed in many different ways every minutes or so c depends on many many things this card is the greatest thing since sliced bread a i like it b well pc magazine seems to think it is c yes this appears to be true d as to greatest thing since sliced bread i doubt it better cards are coming out who knows maybe ati will come out with something faster yet several reviews i read rated one pycon winjet card as a superior performer at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers which pycon was developing at that time pc magazine about two months or so back overall the card has a lot of potential but you have to be able to use it that is the end of the questions these were the most discussed items in this group so i thought they needed confirmation for those of you not familiar with the card i have included a summary here from an ati ad since i don t have an graphics ultra yet ati graphics ultra plus accelerated x at k colours true colour m at x multimedia video acceleration for indeo video rle and video compressed stretch full motion video windows to full size fast vga includes button mouse isa versions only anti aliased fonts ed avail in colour mode only i think real time pan and zoom across large virtual windows desktop around a length card size priced from u s ati graphics ultra pro everything in graphics ultra plus faster performance with vrams accelerated x at colours hz non interlaced available in isa eisa and microchannel priced from u s ati technologies i hope this summary can be of use to you al p s i am not associated with ati technologies in any way other than having used their previous ati ultra card for a few years which i generally liked alan walford eos systems inc vancouver b c canada tel aew eosvcr wimsey bc ca or uunet wimsey bc ca eosvcr aew

workspace managers for win a small review thanks to all those people who recommended workspace managers for windows i found shareware workspace managers from australia s ms windows archive monu cc monash edu au which mirrors some sites in the u s the three i found were workspaces wspace zip this was the smallest and simplest of the workspace managers that i found it is very easy to use it displays a small window containing buttons plus an extra button for configuration purposes one annoying feature was the title window that is first presented when it is run you must press a key not a mouse button for the thing to go away also it would have been nice if there was an always on top setting for the little window containing the workspace buttons maybe some user specified strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be a nice feature the simplicity and ease of use of this workspace manager makes it an attractive package workshift wrksft zip while this workspace manager offered a few features that workspaces lacked it was quite time consuming to set things up with workspaces all but the first workspace is initially empty with workshift you need to take snapshots of how you want each of your workspaces to look like i e what applications they contain also the main window is quite large but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace with workspaces there was no facility for viewing what was in a workspace without switching to it workshift provides this viewing functionality which is quite useful bigdesk and backmenu backdesk zip this is an interesting package which contains a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager other goodies include backmenu which provides a pop up root menu when you press a certain mouse button just like in x windows the menu is totally configurable offering unlimited depth of cascading menus which is provides quite handy access to applications you could say it is a menu based alternative to the program manager also bundled in backdesk zip is a program called wrun which allows you to run windows applications from a dos shell under windows instead of using the file manager to run applications the actual workspace manager is called bigdesk bigdesk works quite differently to the other two workspace managers in that it doesn t provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces in fact it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to focus in on this means you can have windows overlapping between different viewing regions unlike the first two workspace managers in which each workspace was isolated from the other one the bigdesk control window allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop basically the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow up of a particular section try each of them out for yourself i was impressed with all of them so find out which one suits your needs the best

vb to msaccess dde communications a couple of weeks ago i posted a question concerning communicating between vb and msaccess using dde the answers i received at that time allowed me to get a prototype of my project working however during this process i have come up with new problems there seems to be a limit of characters for a dde topic string is this inherent in all dde systems or just peculiar to msaccess or vb it is easy to query an access database from vb using the dde sql command provided the above limitation is overcome by using short field and table names but how is one meant to update a database a a dde sql update command does not seem to work b initiating an access macro using a dde execute command from vb cannot be used because when the macro requests information from vb using a second dde channel the programs dead lock until time outs occur the vb to access channel has to close before the access to vb channel is initiated i guess c access does not allow vb to dde poke the information the way i eventually managed to update a database was by sending key strokes from vb to access using the sendkeys command this technique has the problem that access cannot be minimised and it must always be in a state ready to respond to the sequence of key strokes vb sends are all the above statements correct or have i made incorrect assumptions are there any better work arounds to the above are there any signs of an odbc driver for access bob ran doc ic ac uk

ami pro and pctools compress doesn t like being moved has anyone had problems with ami pro after running pctools v compress i have not corrupted data due to having caches other than pc cache running so that is not it the first time i try to run ami pro after loading windows it loads but causes i think it was a segmentation fault in amipro exe right before it finishes with all times after that only managing to get to the logo box that first pops up when it begins loading and then causes a general protection fault in module amiproui dll at i have not been able to fix this problem except by reinstalling ami pro this has happened twice with both times being after having ran compress on my hard drive btw i am not running stacker or any other disk compression programs and if you don t already know pctools compress is actually a defragger despite it s name my system is a mhz with mb of ram and a nec oem hard drive etc but that shouldn t make a difference please email me as i can t keep up with the newsgroup and it will cut down on net traffic anyways thanks derek dpiaseck jarthur claremont edu

summary borland microsoft database c libraries well i m amazed at how successful this exercise was i received responses and requests for summary thanks to everyone who made it possible on my own i was able to find out about codebase accsys and q e codebase and accsys are c libraries without sql q e is a windows application that can be communicated through windows dde calls where you send a sql string and receive the results most people wrote to tell me about the paradox engine from borland other products mentioned were microsoft s odbc accsys quadbase codebase rbase and q e only odbc quadbase rbase and q e have sql for myself i decided on codebase mostly because it has an ansi c portability version that runs under dos unix etc and includes the source code and portability is important in my application it works with dbase foxpro or clipper files however i feel that microsoft s odbc looks very promising it s mostly a formalisation of building and submitting sql queries and formatting query results as the responses say it s available via ftp except it s effectively unusuable without two manuals the odbc programmer s reference and the odbc sdk guide moreover odbc doesn t actually interpret sql and liase with databases that s up to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers also it s windows only it s actually an extension to the windows sdk nevertheless it s a start at a sql interface standard and should make life interesting in the future here s my original post followed by the responses separated by a line of asterisks does anyone know if borland or microsoft have libraries for accessing their respective databases paradox foxpro from within c programs i d really like to be able to build a sql query string and pass it to a function which returns the query results in some format failing that any other access would still be better than nothing i d also like to hear of third party libraries for doing the same thing if other people are interested i ll prepare a summary of what i m told and post it thanks to all borland has a product called paradox engine that does just what you want the current version is which is fully compatible with ack paradox why the versions are different i don t know pd engine was compatible with pdox and it consists of a rather broad library of functions for accesing database files from both pascal i think turbo pascal and up and c i think either microsoft or borland now reading the box it s borland paradox engine database frameworks works with any borland c c mocrosoft c or later turbo c for windows turbo pascal or later tp for windows or later for framework applications bc or later or ms c c it does have support for object useage i haven t had a real chance to really use it myself but it looks fairly complete i m planning to use it this summer rick rick osterberg osterber husc harvard edu harvard yard mail center cambridge ma usa borland has a product which is called paradox engine i do not know about ms the paradox engine i know very well and it definitiely not a replacement for sql but it will enable you to save and restore records has locking et al supposedly the paradox for windows was impemented on top of it charles parker phone technical support centerline software inc fax cparker centerline com cyberspace momma don t let yer children grow up to be cowboys i know borland has a library of routines for accessing paradox from within a c program they recently came out with version this works with both borland and microsoft s c compiler shailesh bhobe att psp smb ms has put their odbc sdk into the public domain it s big i believe mb but worth downloading over a fast link look at ftp uu net in vendor microsoft odbc sdk also some companies are starting to provide sql engines i just got one for rbase not exactly cheap at but it allows programs in c or vbasic under dos or windows to talk to data bases using sql functions in your code hth walter knopf fermilab knopf fnal fnal gov check out the odbc toolikt from microsoft it is available on ftp uu net vendor microsoft odbc sdk this is the way that we ve chosen to access databases from all of our

model for accessing the paradox s databases it seems to be working fine but i never did try it thouroughly it costs hope it will help you from david lefebvre david hp speedware com borland provides a database lib called paradox engine which can access and use the database files aswell as many other things gary bell nellads cc monash edu au gary bell department of robotics and digital technology faculty of computing caulfield campus monash university australia paradox engine is the library for paradox artur babecki artur ii uj edu pl borland sells the paradox engine which has all the paradox calls in it its hardly sql though you can do searches on key fields and on indivual fields but no comparison operators like so its pretty painful in my opinion do do anything besides simple retrieval and inserts updates i m currently using it i have an eval copy and i ve linked it in to some entry screens i ve written the engine library adds about k to the size of the program but you can load it as an overlay using borland s vroom manager now borland claims that later versions of the engine will have sql support but they don t really expect it till late in the year or even next year they are trying to get thrid parties to help out if you have any other questions let me know mike kamlet mike vpnet chi il us yes borland sells their paradox engine separately it has c c and pascal interfaces although the underlying interface is in c well at least for version of the engine which i have costed at egghead they now have version of the engine and a separate c class package for it michael d kersenbrock adc kentrox portland oregon michaelk kentrox com uunet kentrox michaelk i ve used accsys for paradox new version is almost ready for paradox to access paradox files from c its pretty good not sql though have heard of borland paradox engine or some such which is supposed to do likewise but not sure of what it is exactly hope this helps good luck chris from fernand slinky cs nyu edu christopher fernandes borland sells their paradox engine it s a library of functions for accessing paradox db files it comes with libraries for ms c bcc turbo pascal v and i believe it comes with turbo pascal win libraries as well the c libraries come in both dos and windows flavors the win stuff being dll s when i got it it also came with crystal reports which is a graphical report generator it allows you to create a generic form and use it within a compiled program using pdox engine i don t know if they still offer it or what the current price is i paid something like for an upgrade from the earlier version though hope this helps david taylor the commander it is easier to change the internet gt c prism gatech edu specification to fit the program also dtaylor cfd gatech edu than vice versa and root cfd gatech edu author unknown but very wise if you want to do sql from within your programs check out quadbase i don t have their address oops yes i do quadbase systems inc lucerne dr sunnyvale ca usa phone voice fax ask for the sql win demo disk it looked good to me i have a background in embedded sql in ingres this looked real similar it s a little expensive but if you order the demo and then just wait they will probably send you a special offer that ll probably run about us good luck best tom delosh from delosh emunix emich edu tom delosh borland has the paradox engine library it has libraries for both c and pascal to access paradox files under dos windows but for paradox i believe you d have buy have the sql link since pdox itself isn t sql compliant i ve used the engine for over a year now and have been pretty satisfied with it under dos it s a real pig it tacks on about k to the size of your programs tim ma associate programmer university of utah email tim src cppa utah edu i don t know about microsoft but borland sells the paradox engine for c c pascal in one package and if you want dbase compatible files there is a library called codebase from sequiter software that works with c c from davidr rincon ema rockwell com david j ray we re using q e database libraries to do what you describe it s a set of dll s accessed through a common api to talk to most of the major database formats we re using it to build an application that queries several databases using sql queries all access using q e is done using sql the package is available through microway in melbourne i believe it is produced by pioneer systems in the us we have no association with microway or pioneer systems other than being satisfied customers feel free to mail me for further information chris programming for nsw national parks and wildlife service chris hutchinson box u research programmer university of new england chris sulaw law su oz au armidale nsw paradox engine provides a complete set of c libraries for accessing paradox tables however it seems that it supports only borland turbo c and microsoft c when i tried to compile the engine s sample applications with the waterloo watcom c c bit compiler it complains that the library file llibce lib is missing even though i am quite certain that the file is not part of watcom c or the engine anybody have any success with other c compilers ron k ng hydro on ca i m currently developing an app with borland s paradox engine for c it also comes in pascal which has recently gone to version i e px engine is compatible with paradox and downward compat w there are indeed c libs for fox access but i can t think of the names offhand i m sure someone has already written you in that regard i think i just saw an add for a fox lib in the c users journal which is a good place to look for this type of package in general by the way i ve been paying my dues to learn a lot of the quirks of px eng over the past year wouldn t recommend it for a complex multiuser app but i m staying with it for now it s like a bad marriage i ve got too much time invested in learning and work arounds but if your interest is limited to a simple single user interface you want to build your own sql engine i take it px engine will do the job easily it doesn t sound like you ll be bumping into any of the gotchas

re viewsonic experience sought vs vs nec fg i d appreciate if you can email or post you positive or negative experience with this monitor especially compared to to nanao i i d summarize if i got multiple responses i bought a viewsonic for use at home but after a week i took it back i felt for the money my nec fg that i use at work was a much better monitor the nec is sharper flatter less distorted and more stable i have heard complaints from people about the nec fg series having some quality control problems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all there was nothing really broken with the viewsonic but overall it did not match up i used my ati graphics ultra in setup mode to push the frequencies to their limits and the viewsonic exhibited some problems that the nec did not i personally like the non etched nec with the ocli filter and the tube on the was not as nice the had some uncorrectable pincusion and edge distortion problems also it would change brightness when i switched modes and i was constantly having to fiddle with the controls and the yoke was crooked and i had no way to compensate for the raster that tilted downhill on the postive side although not as handsome as the nec the had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy i have heard that panasonic owns viewsonic and the model is being sold through oem channels with a panasonic label on it if it s available that way at a lower cost i could get more serious about it for now the nec has my vote but i m searching for one of the new cheaper nec fge s to see if it s just as good as its older brother the fg before i decide which one to buy i have no experience with the nanao i can never keep the nanao models straight and don t have any place i can walk in to get a good comparison of all models standard employer disclaimers apply keith w johnson tektronix gpi nd info services wilsonville or usa internet keith w johnson tek com voice fax
rfd comp os ms windows nt misc setup this is the official request for discussion rfd for the creation of two new newsgroups for microsoft windows nt this is a second rfd replacing the one originally posted in january and never taken to a vote the proposed groups are described below name comp os ms windows nt setup status unmoderated purpose discussions about setting up and installing windows nt and about system and peripheral compatability issues for windows nt name comp os ms windows nt misc status unmoderated purpose miscellaneous non programming discussions about using windows nt including issues such as security networking features console mode and windows win compatability rationale microsoft nt is the newest member of the microsoft windows family of operating systems or operating environments for those who wish to argue about the meaning of an os the family ranges from modular windows through windows and windows for workgroups to windows nt at the high end to date microsoft has shipped over beta copies and pre release sdks of windows nt the actual release is slated for may june while windows nt has an entirely new design internally it shares an application programming interface with the other members of the windows family its win api includes the win api used in win dows and the win s api subset win less threads networking and security can be used to create bit applications for windows the user interface is also practically identical to that of windows with the addition of logins and a few other features it uses program manager file manager and other applets and generally pre sents an identical appearance to the user many of the announced windows nt applications are ports of existing windows apps and nt also runs existing applications thus it appears logical that windows nt should share the following groups with the other members of the windows family comp os ms windows apps comp os ms windows programmer tools comp os ms windows programmer misc comp os ms windows programmer win the following groups are also clearly applicable to windows nt as well as windows comp os ms windows announce comp os ms windows advocacy in conclusion the only clear argument for the separation of the windows and windows nt hierarchies is different internal structures of windows and windows nt and yet operating systems such as os macintosh os xenix and coherent all have undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate newsgroup hierarchies further windows is due for a major rewrite itself in when the fully bit protected mode and with dos built in next generation windows chicago debuts next year surely it should remain in the same hierarchy and what then would be the jus tification for separating windows nt from other windows versions discussion period the discussion period will run from april to may voting the cfv call for votes will be issued around may based on the feedback received during the discussion period no votes will be accepted prior to the cfv tom haapanen tomh metrics com software metrics inc waterloo ont stick your index fingers into both corners of your mouth now pull up that s how the corrado makes you feel car january

another happy gateway owner since i ve been seeing all kinds of complaints regarding gateways lately on here i thought i post my recent pleasant experiences my machine dx v this past friday this was two weeks to the day from when i called the order in upon unboxing it i found everything to be in perfect order all the peripherals i ordered were properly installed jumbo cd rom i was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the gateway documentation all software came with the original disks and manuals the gateway manual itself is in a nice ring binder the ati gup came with build drivers all other software i specified microsoft office was properly installed the machine came right up out of the box and has been performing flawlessly it s been on all weekend and it hardly even reaches room temperature i think the big roomy tower case has a lot to do with it it s up and running dos with no problems i ve also read about some people having problems with high speed serial communications i used the dos interlink program which lets me link to my old computer via a serial port at k baud it then maps the other machines two hard disks as my disks f g you can cd to these drives and either run programs or copy files it s almost like a peer peer lan except you can also run programs on the other machine it s not a two way street the other machine is the server and this machine is the client so thats where it seems to differ from the peer to peer stuff for a bundled dos utility its very impressive my jumbo took about minutes to back up mb of data i also by passed any potential gateway monitor problems by taking the credit and applying it towards a nec fg i love this monitor so i m glad there is some good news gateway stories and i m glad it was me now if it just keeps working john john gayman wa wbu uucp uunet wa wbu john packet wa wbu wb eah

controller is a western digital wd s wx rev c as i said above the drive is a seagate st the system is a compaq portable circa ah finally a question i can answer i mess with this older stuff alot kinda fun first problem i can forsee is that the st will not be compadible with that wd card unless it has the right bios rom check the numbers on it it should be the only non smt chip on the board slightly

jumped with a trace between pins and to select the primary controller address the drive jumpers are as follows represents jumper looks right art deleted here are my questions are the drive and

open closed closed open open note those are how wd runs the numbers on the jumper block top to bottom s represent the jumper pins pins and select the first drive setting drive and pins and select the second drive drive if you have the rom it s a auto config and i ll have to look up how to do it i don t have the big book right here are the jumpers on the card drive set correctly see above you might have problems if the s jumpers are not right also at the risk of being insulting make sure the cables are on right and good on the jumper on the try moving it to the opposite side of the drive it s one or the other the narrow data cable goes to j i ve thrown it on j a few times and banged my head for a day is my system s bios in need of an upgrade dunno ibm roms had to be later than a quick way

how to program a pc keyboard itself hi all i have heard that somewhere there exist programmable keyboards eg one can program displays on the keys to show some specific characters et c does it mean that there is some way of transmitting some non trivial data to the kb as opposed to standard numlock on off typeamatic specs from inside the pc software i have not found any corresponding reference in the specs for the pc kb interface anyone have any ideas except that they may encode data by the sequences of the standard commands mentioned above which wouldn t look too neat besides what would one do from an xt great thanks in advance andrew

re i don t understand si mg joohwee students neural iss nus sg wrote mg i went buying simms recently and the sales person told me that the mg are chip simms and chip simms and one cannot use them interchan mg if you use one you have to use all of the same type don t believe everything you are told i can tell you that mixing them between banks ok and i can t see why mixing in one bank is not unless they are of different speeds e g mixing of ns and ns simms in one bank the two only differ in the type of chips it uses assuming that the simms are mx bit wide here is the two equivalent configuration the chip simm uses two bit wide mbit m of bit nibbles and one bit wide mbit chip for a total of bit wide mbyte the bit simm uses nine bit wide mbit chips these are equivalent because of the way that it is pinned on the simm board at the simm interface they both act as bit wide mbyte simms sorry if too techie for ya mg similarly one cannot plug in two mb simms and one mb simms to gi mg the system a total of meg why is that so if my system supports mg of meg it has simm slots can i plug in mb simms to give my mg mb that sounds correct the problem is that if your computer takes bit wide simms you can not mix different sizes in one bank why you ask simple if you understand why there is banks assuming you have a bit cpu dx or the data bus e g the mechanism to retrieve data from memory is bits wide so the computer expects to see bits when it asks for data to get that bandwidth bit wide the motherboard links mx one bit is not data but parity so i will ignore that in this simple explaination to get bits bits that means that a simm in a bank stores only of the bit wide data if you have a bit bus two mx simms are linked together to get bit wide data which is the reason why banks are simms wide and bit banks are simms wide if your computer required mx e g bit wide data with parity bits used in some ps s and asts you could upgrade by one simm at a time hope that this message is not over your head but the answer to your question was not simple i could of just said because i said so rdd winqwk b unregistered evaluation copy kmail d w net hq hal k ann arbor mi us or hal bbs qwk to usenet gateway four v bis dial ins free usenet mail and newsgroups pcboard am uupcb kmail call or member of eff asp asad mb disk serving ann arbor since

re dx vs dx anonymous i saw a posting about the choice between dx and a dx i was wondering although a dx is faster because of the path to it s external cache shouldn t the choice be the dx as that one can be made to work properly with a local bus i mean cache speed is one thing but all your speed will be blocked during video i o so just get that faster i m willing to speculate that the dx with local bus will be times as fast as the dx and probably as expensive or cheap regards jv name j v meuldijk o o address gildelaar hw teteringen holland e mail volkert kub nl oooo oooo

ram boards on a hello i have a sx isa machine with pheonix bios currently i have megabytes of ram installed via eight mg simms on the motherboard ie both banks are full and there is no space for more simms i am thinking of running os on my machine and possibly linux with x windows and i know that more ram would be helpful however with simms the only solution i can see is to sell my megs for about and by mg simms for about used apart from the fact that i can t afford the price right now the entire process of selling ram and buying it used probably means that the machine might be down for a number of days which i would rather avoid so my question is do the at ram boards that plug into a free slot work well with a isa machine i have seen some being sold used for about with mg with space for another mg s if these boards do work how do they do it is a device driver needed or will the bios pickup the extra ram as it does with the simms on the mother board i know that the isa expansions slots are bits and simm memory is bits so probably all of this is just wishful thinking however any help is truly appreciated eric ebosco us oracle com

re ide vs scsi in article qk kvinnndk dns nmsu edu bgrubb dante nmsu edu grubb writes point of view why does scsi have an advantage when it comes to multi tasking data is data and it could be anywhere on the drive can scsi find it faster can it get it off the drive and into the computer faster does it have a better cache system i thought scsi was good at managing a data bus when multiple devices are attached if we are only talking about a single drive explain why scsi is inherently faster at managing data from a hard drive ide integrated device electronics currently the most common standard and is mainly used for medium sized drives can have more than one hard drive asynchronous transfer mb s max why don t you start with the spec sheet of the isa bus first you can quote scsi specs till you re blue in the face but if they exceed the isa bus capability then what s the point who says ide is limited to megs sec what about vlb ide does anyone know how they perform so at its lowest setting scsi interface in asynchronous scsi mode averages the through put maximum of ide in asynchronous mode in full scsi mode it blows poor ide out the window down the street and into the garbage can as implimented on what system the problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rates and that is where the bottleneck and cost of scsi comes from not the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the scsi through put given the original question scsi used only as a single hard drive controller is it then necessary to get a scsi drive that will do at least maybe megs sec for the scsi choice to make any sence what does a meg megs sec scsi drive cost the cost of scsi interface is a self fulliling prophisy few people buy scsi because it is so expencive for the pc which in turn convices makes that mass producing scsi which would reduce its cost is unwarented and so scsi is expencive that is the effect of the rule of scale the more items sold the less each item has to bare the brunt the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost the original cga cart back in was i think the original ega card or pga was scsi has stood relatively alone in not coming down in price mainly because we re talking about pc s and not sun s or sparc or sgi or name your favorite unix workstation that is after millions of pc buying decisions over the years scsi has had plenty of time to come down in price i won t argue that the scsi standard makes for a good well implimented data highway but i still want to know why it intrinsically better than ide on an isa bus when it comes to multi tasking os s when managing data from a single scsi hard drive

s c w mb x x k colors orchid pipe dream hi i have an orchid fahrenheit vlb with mb of dram it is an s c based card i had a problem for a while after installing my second meg of dram for the video and thanks to orchid i got a fix from their tech support it was jumper settings not given in the ordinary manual i assume it would come with memory ordered from them so i guess i should be glad they didn t just say buy the memory from us or something like that the one thing that i was puzzled by was why there was not a x x k color mode on the thing either in full screen or enlarged desktop mode my ati ultra plus can handle that given mb of memory all the mb buys you on the fahrenheit is x x just one more mode geez had i known i wouldn t have bothered i asked them why and all i got was your point is well taken but orchid s software developers are busy with other projects so to get to the point finally are there any s c drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes i d love to get another card but perhaps it will have to wait until the next generation of cards comes out since this card came bundled with my system and it s not so easy to exchange these things unless they re broken if you want these modes steer away from orchids s c cards ie vlb or va vlb at least until their developers are less busy if the magazines are to believed i ve only seen one s c product thus far which can handle x x k color genoa although evenn that might be a misprint please if there are generic or semi generic drivers out there let me know where i can get them x x k is ok but i coulda gotten that with my ati vga wonder xl thanks donyee athena mit edu

re soundblaster irq and port settings my solution was to switch the interrupt to irq which is unreserved in contemporary computers using irq for the drives went out with the xt architechture not completly true for at class and later machines irq is reserved for lpt since it s rare to have a second parallel port in a pc it s usually a good safe choice if you need an interrupt on the other hand we just ran into a problem with that here at work on a gateway computer dx v it has a modem on com a mouse on com and the other serial port was set to com which normally uses the same interrupt as com we had a real fight with a board when trying to use irq and discoverd the problem was that gateway had set it up such that com used irq as soon as we disabled com our problems went away grumble after several days of trying to figure out why the interrupt didn t work mike sprague wbst xerox com

cache or micronics eisa vlb motherboard this might be a silly question but i have to ask it anyway i am in the process of purchasing an eisa vl bus dx computer and i found two places that sell machines that have what i want and have the same price the first is ares and they use a cache motherboard that s the brand of the motherboard with opti chip set the other is micron formerly edge technology and they use the micronics eisa vlb motherboard i said that this might be a silly question since i believe that micronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while i never heard of cache i am however leaning towards the ares machine because my impression is that they are known for building good solid machines and they have good tech support hr days wk and a better warrantee years micron on the other hand seems to have recently aquired edge technologies and i m not sure how much i should trust the company i would really appreciate any input on this is the micron machine the clear choice does anyone know anything positive or negative about either company has anyone ever heard of cache motherboards should i go with micron just because it has the micronics motherboard etc thanks very much in advance for any information mohammad al ansari
int h for joysticks is slow i m using int h to read my joystick and it is hideously slow something like of my cpu time is being spent reading the joystick and this is in a program that does nothing but printf and joyread the problem is that a lot of programs trap int h like smartdrv and so it is a slow as hell interface can i read the joystick port in a reasonably safe fashion via polling and that isn t platform or clockspeed specific thanks brianzex
re colorado jumbo for gateway pd world std com peter f davis writes i ve just installed a new colorado jumbo tape backup unit from gateway and i have a couple of complaints with it i don t know how common or serious these problems may be i would appreciate some feedback from others who have used this system btw this is on a dx v tower system i have a similar configuration colorado mb on dx tower the problems are o firstly gateway shipped me only mb tapes even though the drive is a mb unit when i called to complain they only said that s all we carry and with compression you can fit mb on one tape maybe so but then why did i pay extra for the large capacity tape drive you got suckered in the same way i did silly me believing that the logo on the front meant actual carrying capacity the people who do this sort of thing for a living call it marketing lawyers who prosecute it call it fraud perhaps we can have a bunch of other duped buyers march on their corporate headquarters o i have about mb of data on my c drive i choose the space optimizing compression scheme and started a full backup the software estimated it would take about minutes it took hours does this sound about right this is a bit long my system takes about minutes to do the same thing usually hours particularly if the tape is grinding away the whole time means that your block size for the write is too small is there any way to change the block size or write buffer size so it s bigger o during the backup about a dozen files came up with access denied errors most of these were in c windows system comm drv keyboard drv shell dll etc but also c windows progman exe and a couple of files in the c tape directory anyone else had this happen this is because the files are opened by dos the files in the tape directory are likely the executable file or the configuration file for the tape system i would recommend running the backup from dos so it will make a complete backup of the tape directory thanks for any and all feedback on this system i d also appreciate hearing of good sources for blank tape cartridges preferably mb size the mb cartridges won t do you any good since the drive won t write mb of physical data on the tape thanks pd brent williams brentw netcom com san jose california

email to me compuserve internet darrylo sr hp com windows enhanced mode the windows install program should automatically configure dos and windows for use with the adaptec however just in case something went wrong i m going to describe some of the changes needed to get windows working with the also you may have noticed that installing windows makes your pc run much slower even when you re not running windows methods of speeding it up are discussed in the section called windows runs slowly msdos configuration the windows install program adds the smartdrive disk cache to your config sys and autoexec bat files if you follow the instructions you ll notice that you ll need to use double buffering with smartdrive this is the default setup you ll also notice that your system runs much much slower in both windows and msdos see the section called windows runs slowly for some ways of speeding your system up windows configuration to get the adaptec to work with windows make sure that the enh section of the system ini file contains the entry virtualhdirq off i believe that the windows install program automatically adds this entry to system ini but i m not sure if this doesn t work for you you might want to try adding some more lines virtualhdirq off systemrombreakpoint false emmexclude a cfff you probably don t need the above lines though the systemrombreakpoint entry is used to enable support for memory managers like qemm max only needed if you use such programs windows runs slowly once you do get windows running with the chances are that your system is running much slower than before if it s not it s probably because you happen to be using aspi dos sys version in your config sys file congratulations this appears to be a winning solution you are very lucky whether your luck will hold out remains to be seen if your system is running much slower than before this is almost definitely caused by smartdrive with double buffering according to the windows documentation and the microsoft technical note q smartdrive double buffering required with aspi dos sys you must use smartdrive with double buffering enabled while this works it really slows down your pc i once estimated that this slowed my pc down by a factor of five as i consider this unacceptable i looked for other solutions unfortunately you cannot just disable double buffering if you do windows in enhanced mode will not work and you might even destroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run windows what you can do is one of the following use other drivers that provide double buffering it is my opinion that the unbelievable slowness in smartdrive is caused either by horribly inefficient double buffering or by a bug in smartdrive use a driver that provides vds services vds stands for virtual dma services this is a standard which is supported by windows that allows bus mastering disk controllers like the to work with windows after trashing my hard disk countless times i found the following solutions none of which require using smartdrive note however that i am now getting occasional parity errors which are probably not caused by these solutions but might be see below while the following does not require smartdrive using some kind of disk cache utility is strongly recommended as this makes windows run much much faster if you do not have the aspi dos sys driver or you do not need aspi functions for controlling a cdrom tape drive more than two physical hard disks etc you can add the scsiha sys driver to your config sys file e g driver c scsiha sys v windows needs the v option this driver must be loaded into low memory it cannot be loaded into high memory and it occupies about k as of november the scsiha sys driver could be obtained from the adaptec bbs at hopefully it s still there if you need aspi functions and have the aspi dos sys driver version or a you can use both the aspi dos sys and scsiha sys drivers in your config sys file e g driver c aspi dos sys driver c scsiha sys v amazingly enough the scsiha sys driver can also be loaded high assuming you have dos i would have thought that this would crash my system but it doesn t i asked adaptec s technical support about this and they said that loading scsiha sys high should be fine as long as aspi dos sys is loaded low on my system not using scsiha sys with aspi dos a would occasionally cause windows to crash upon restarting or exiting windows with the additional result of a corrupted disk some of my c windows grp files would be corrupted for me these crashes usually occurred while making a different program from progman exe the default windows shell and vice versa this is the reason scsiha sys may be necessary i have absolutely no idea if scsiha sys is necessary with versions of aspi dos earlier than note that many people can use aspi dos or a without scsiha sys they do not seem to have any problems at all i consider these people lucky others like me have had all sorts of problems in my opinion the best but not necessarily the easiest solution is to upgrade to aspi dos the scsiha sys driver is no longer needed unfortunately while you could get previous aspi dos upgrades from the adaptec bbs the aspi dos driver is not available from the adaptec bbs as far as i know there are only three ways to get a copy you can buy the new as of november adaptec ez scsi driver kit which supposedly includes aspi dos as well as other drivers such as cdrom drivers i believe the list price is around if you already have a copy of an older version of aspi dos you can supposedly contact adaptec to upgrade it to ez scsi for around a copy of aspi dos is included in central point pc tools for msdos note that the documentation and driver are stored in different directories note further that only aspi dos is included the cdrom drivers and drivers to support more than two hard disks are not included this is where i obtained my copy of aspi dos note however that i am now getting occasional parity errors with windows in all probability defective hardware in my pc is causing this as i upgraded my motherboard just after i found the above solutions however because these parity errors occur only during disk accesses there is a very small but definite possibility that the parity errors are driver related for example changing the bus on off timing for certain disk transfers might cause this i ve run various memory tests for hours at a time and these tests have found no problems this problem is probably caused by memory with marginal timing requirements which cause parity errors during disk transfers this is why the memory tests didn t find any problems the problems show up only under disk i o however i m mentioning this just in case it isn t a hardware problem floppy controller based tape backup devices there are two possible problems with using the adaptec with a floppy controller based tape backup device such as the colorado memory systems jumbo tape backups restores can take a very long time the tape drive constantly starts stops starts stops etc tape operations may be erratic or encounter too many tape errors this problem might be caused by defective hardware on my however i ve heard of other people having similar problems and so i m mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my tape backups restores take a long time if you have a floppy controller based tape backup device you may have to adjust the adaptec bus on off timing for best results when using the tape drive normally while doing a tape backup or restore the tape drive motor should be continuously running with only an occasional pause however the default bus timing on the adaptec may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop start and stop every few seconds this causes needless wear to the tape and tape drive however note that a dirty tape head or a defective tape drive can also cause this make sure your tape heads are clean this also causes the tape backup or restore to take much much longer than necessary the problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy dma to transfer data in memory to from the tape drive and the adaptec uses dma to transfer data in memory to from the hard disk the floppy dma needs to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate if the tape drive is not fed data quickly enough by the floppy dma the tape drive stops rewinds a bit and restarts once enough data is eventually fed to it the default bus timing on the adaptec which is really dma timing is too large for example when a backup is done data has to be transferred from a hard disk to memory and then from memory to the tape because the default timing on the adaptec hogs the memory too much too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to memory not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the tape drive as a result the tape drive constantly starts and stops because data is not fed to it quickly enough the solution is to change the adaptec s bus on off timing the default factory setting is microseconds on and microseconds off the bus on timing needs to be lowered to microseconds this can be done in one of two ways if you have aspi dos you can use the n option for example i use a bus on timing of microseconds which means that i use the following line in my config sys file device c aspi dos sys n note that there is no space between the n and the if you don t have aspi dos your only recourse is to try to find a program called setscsi exe which is very difficult to find the reason is that adaptec for reasons of their own does not seem to want this widely distributed i once asked someone who worked for adaptec and they asked me to not upload it anywhere if you have anonymous ftp access to the internet you could try using archie to hunt down a copy i believe that there are a couple of sites that have it if you do find a copy you run it like so setscsi n this adjusts the bus on timing to microseconds running setscsi exe without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the factory defaults note that it seems that you cannot use setscsi exe if you use aspi dos setscsi exe crashed my system if aspi dos was loaded i could use setscsi exe with scsiha sys however do not lower the bus on timing below microseconds or increase it above microseconds if you lower it too low the hard disk throughput will suddenly drop your system will feel slower for me microseconds works fine this value may work fine for you or you may have to adjust it downwards a little once you ve lowered the bus on timing tape backups and restores should run faster also do not experiment with the bus on off times with the other options that i have intentionally not described unless you know what you are doing bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse by starving memory refresh a program called bustifix exe exists on the adaptec bbs unless this has been upgraded since i last checked which has been a while this is a self extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple of other files this batch file was supposed to allow one to set the bus on off times for the and others however when i tried running this program with my a my system crashed at the time i was running scsiha sys and i didn t check to see if there was a conflict with it maybe this old program works only with the b although the docs say that it works with the a erratic tape operations or too many tape errors this problem may or may not exist although it existed on my system a hardware problem just on my particular could cause it however i ve heard of other people having similar problems and so i m mentioning this just in case it isn t a hardware problem just on my symptoms of this problem which persists even after cleaning the tape head backing up to tape encounters unusable sector detected errors resulting in an aborted tape backup tape backup works but the tape compare fails the tape drive starts stops starts stops etc much too often unlike the above mentioned problem tape backups restores take a long time where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds this kind of starting stopping occurs every few seconds or so fastback plus does not find see any tape backup devices other programs like central point backup and the cms jumbo software assuming that you have a cms jumbo tape drive can find see the tape drive but fastback plus cannot too many tape read errors although i do not know what is causing this problem i discovered that using a different floppy controller solves it a few months ago i upgraded my motherboard which contained an integrated floppy controller as i already had a floppy controller on the i initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller after a while i decided to try disabling the floppy controller and using the one on the motherboard when i did this the tape drive a cms jumbo reliability increased dramatically and fastback plus was suddenly able to find and use the tape drive i don t know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my on the one hand the floppy drives worked great when they were attached to the which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the on the other hand the tape drive didn t work well attached to the floppy controller but it did work when attached to a different controller this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my i did change floppy drive cables and so it is conceivable that the problem was in the cables i don t know what the cause really is however if you re having similar problems you might want to consider trying a new floppy controller sound cards many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound and this is typically done using dma like the tape drive dma the adaptec s dma can conflict with the sound card dma unlike that of the tape dma this conflict usually manifests itself as a parity error your system crashes with a parity error message what happens is that data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the adaptec memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough which causes a parity error usually getting a parity error means that there is a hardware problem with your system in this case however the parity error is not a symptom of bad hardware i ve found that such parity errors typically occur while recording digitized sound and the chances of such errors increase as you increase the recording fidelity e g higher sampling rate recording in stereo recording using bits instead of etc like the tape drive solution the solution here is to lower the adaptec s bus on timing see the section on tape drives for information on how this is done note however that this may or may not solve the problem it may only reduce the probability of a parity error the software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect this problem i e some software is inefficient disk caches the speed of your hard disk and the amount of disk fragmentation can also affect this miscellaneous info this section contains miscellaneous hints tips and rumors much of it is merely information that i ve heard or read about and have not verified i believe that the following information is correct but i m not sure use it at your own risk with qemm and you need to specify the db parameter e g db unless you are using the aspi dos driver if you don t qemm will crash hang at bootup although the qemm manual mentions this the install program does not seem to detect that a is present and automatically add this option to the qemm command line at least this occurred with the qemm install program i haven t tested any other version earlier versions of qemm probably need this parameter but i m not sure i ve never used a version earlier than if you use aspi dos you do not need to give qemm the db parameter some or all versions of the do not support hard disks over one gigabyte in size to support hard disks with capacities over gb you need to get a new rom bios from adaptec i m not sure if this is still true of the latest bs being sold by adaptec to connect a cdrom drive to the you need a scsi cdrom drive and some drivers note that some cdrom drives have proprietary interfaces non scsi these drives cannot be used with the you have three choices for cdrom drivers i have no idea how well the following solutions work or even if they work the following is secondhand information you can buy adaptec s ez scsi driver package which lists for something like if you already have older adaptec drivers you can supposedly upgrade to ez scsi for around contact adaptec for details the ez scsi package supposedly contains everything that you need you can buy the corelscsi driver package which is made by the same people that make coreldraw this package contains cdrom drivers scsi tape drivers worm drivers etc i do not know the list price but i ve seen this package sold for around note that corelscsi does not come with the aspi dos driver which is needed if you do not already have aspi dos you may be better off getting adaptec s ez scsi instead this method is obsolete as the following drivers have been obsoleted by adaptec s ez scsi kit but i m mentioning it in case someone already has these drivers you can use the drivers in the adaptec asw kit aspi dos and the asw kit aspi cdrom drivers you will have to get a copy of mscdex exe a high level cdrom driver if it is not included in the asw kit but this is available from several bulletin boards to use a scsi tape drive with the you need software that knows how to talk to a scsi tape drive software that i ve heard about are again like the above section on cdrom drives i have no idea how well the following solutions work or even if they work the following is secondhand information central point pc tools for msdos supposedly supports a large number of scsi tape drives it comes with scsi drivers aspi dos as well as central point backup the corelscsi driver package contains a scsi tape backup program see the above section on cdrom drives for more details however note that corelscsi does not come with but requires aspi dos i ve seen advertisements that sell the in three configurations scsi controller with hard disk rom bios scsi controller w bios and adaptec aspi drivers scsi controller w bios adaptec aspi drivers and corelscsi drivers programs i imagine that adaptec now sells the in a fourth configuration scsi controller w bios and ez scsi drivers including aspi drivers those people who use unix might be interested in a version of gnu tar for msdos that talks to a scsi tape drive via the aspi dos driver you need this driver before you can use this program i ve never used this version of gnu tar but i ve heard that it works i don t know how well though if you have anonymous ftp access to the internet a copy can be found on wsmr simtel army mil and mirror sites pd msdos dskutl aspibin zip gnu tar for scsi tape drives adaptec xx aspipat zip patches for aspibin relative to gnu tar aspisrc zip src for gnu tar for scsi tape adaptec ctrlr i have no idea if a copy can be found on compuserve unixforum might have it if any forum does as far as msdos is concerned the a and the b controllers are the same with msdos the a should work as well as the b however the hardware for these two boards is not identical and there is at least one non msdos program that initially did not work with a a but did work with a b bsd a version of bsd unix in case anyone s curious here s an edited copy of my

re booting from b drive david weisberger djweisbe unix amherst edu wrote i have a drive as drive a how can i make the system boot from my b drive optimally the computer would be able to boot from either a or b checking them in order for a bootable disk but if i have to switch cables around and simply switch the drives so that it can t boot disks that s ok also boot b won t do the trick for me thanks davebo we had the same issue plague us for months on our gateway i finally got tired of it so i permanently interchanged the drives the only reason i didn t do it in the first place was because i had several bootable s and some based install disks which expected the a drive i order all new software and upgrades to be and the number of stupid install programs that can t handle an alternate drive are declining with time the ones i had are now upgraded and as for the bootable s i just cut replacements if switching the drives is not an option you might be able to wire up a drive switch to your computer chasis i haven t tried it but i think it would work as long as it is wired carefully gordon lang

orchid p vs fahrenheit mini review i just purchased a viewsonic and and orchid p in short i am happy with the monitor and unhappy with the card i have spent a lot more time futzing with the card so that is what i am going to write about the monitor is pretty the moires i had under simcity on my magnavox went away it isn t as heavy as i thought it would be lbs i think so much for the monitor on to the bitch session and test results in going with the modern trend the orchid p card only supports colors in x mode without a driver of course this breaks any dos program which uses svga modes like most of my cd roms the compudyne whiplash vga orchid fahrenheit and orchid f vlb all share this limitation those are all s cards which means it is an s problem for them the p uses a weitek vga chip which also doesn t support them the hercules graphite card does seem to have these modes but i didn t run the same test cases as i did on the other boards during the brief time i had it it was able to print the splash screen for the grolier s encyclopedia though which the s cards just printed as hash which is why i suspect the svga modes are supported the supported resolutions really annoy me you can do x at hz if you tell the driver you have an nec fg they only have about six monitors listed plus generic and if you choose generic you can t get any high refreshes at all but at x you are limited to hz seems to me that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth if it can do hz at it sure should be able to do it at higher vertical resolution was the main reason i bought the card over the orchid f vlb i currently have and it will do x x hz as well the higher graphics modes all crash hp dashboard i just got off the phone with orchid and with the drivers i don t know what i have he was unable to recreate the problem on the plus side their tech rep was as helpful as he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn t have the problem he didn t know why they limited the refresh to hz either the board is faster that the ofvlb for most things according to the hercules speedy program this program tests various operations and reports the results in pixels second i don t have the numbers for the graphite card but they were close to half of the ofvlb ie slower but that was running in a mhz isa so the numbers aren t really comparable the following numbers were all obtained using a mhz air motherboard umc chipset with mb memory i give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it computes them and these tend to jump around a bit k means thousand not m means million pixels per second orchid fahrenheit vlb orchid p chip s weitek dib to screen k k k k memory to screen m m m m screen to screen m m m m vector solid m m m vector styled k k k k polygon shaded m m m m polygon hatched m m m m ternary rops m m k k font k k k k m the dib to screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers it to the screen i have no idea what is being done internally as far as conversions go the memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to the screen my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can just be copied to the video display the screen to screen test copies that face from place to place on the screen awesome interestingly the solid vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement and hatched polygons ie filled with cross hatching and ternary rops whatever they are graphics operations like xors maybe are a dead loss on the i give two numbers for the fonts because i think they are caching when the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly the speed of the ofvlb then the speed increases dramatically sounds like programming to a benchmark to me i make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all its just what i saw when i ran them on my computer i normally don t write disclaimers but this time maybe i d better my testing is totally unconnected with my work i program under unix on decstations is done completely without the knowledge blessing or equipment of my company geoff sherwood

re ide vs scsi here we go again in article apr julian uwo ca wlsmith valve heart rri uwo ca wayne smith writes in article ercc h w netcom com erc netcom com eric smith writes scsi is better because it has a better future and it has a lot of minor advantages right now ide cards are cheaper right now but will be obsolete in a few years in fact ide cards are so cheap they might as well be free the real cost is in the ide drives scsi cards cost more but they are worth it i almost got a hernia laughing at this one you ll probably get one when you realize that your vesa super dooper local bus ultra high tech controller sucks if anything scsi on a pc will be obsolete killed off by vesa local with any luck pc bus archeitecture will be doen any with by sbus have you ever seen what happens when you hook a busmaster controller to a vesa local bus it actually slows down your system bus ide it must be real nice to get shafted by bucks for the extra cost of a scsi drive then pay another for a scsi controller maybe my workstation doesn t understand what your vesa local bus ide is vesa local bus will be killed off by pcmi whatever intels spec is vlbus it not good for much more than vga cards to each his own i ll laugh when you start crying over how much you spent for your little ide drives and then finding out you need more space the biggest advantage of scsi right now is that you can add more different kinds of devices such as tapes etc easily and can add bigger disks the best and most cost effective hard disks available are scsi here here only of you need drives larger then meg oh yes gotta have megs sec transfer rate for those speedy tape backups and cd rom drives don t stick your foot in your mouth when you make a statement you know nothing about i d rather wait a second compared to the minutes and ide would take obviously exaggerated have you ever tried to backup gigs of disk oh i forgot you can t because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big basically if a person has to ask which one is better for him her then they will probably never see the expensive benefits from scsi i guess you probably bought a sx too also all this arm waving about scsi expandability is a moot point if the user only has one or two drives on it and with scsi those two drives may be fast but that speed is only due to the onboard memory cache something i can duplicate with a caching ide controller what the scsi fast wide spec has much more bandwidth than any stupid vlbus ide crap stop this thread now its just cluttering up bandwidth if you want to read about scsi vs ide just pay a visit to you local usenet archive the best scsi fast wide etc is clearly faster than any the best ide drive all the response given are based upon personal experience with or drives you can t judge such completely different interfaces ide has the low cost adavantage a descent performance scsi has the ability for super high capacity expandibility and speed neither one is better in all cases if you don t belive what i said about busmastering and vlbus then pick up a back issue of pc week in whihc they tested vlbus eisa and isa busmastering cards send flames to dev null scott mace internet smace nyx cs du edu emace tenet edu
mb isa limit i was just reading in pc magazine that the peripherals in a pc with an isa bus can only access mb of memory also that some video cards on the isa bus look for a memory aperture to map their memory to so that if i wanted to put mb of memory on my pc my video card wouldn t have anywhere to map it s memory to can someone explain this in more detail is there a way around this limit if you email me a response i will summarize bo begolej csgrad cs vt edu james bo begole begolej csgrad cs vt edu

re changing motherboards messing with connectors in article ip portland caps maine edu jozef slaby ip portland caps maine edu writes when i changed my motherboard i had a lot of trouble getting led spkr turbo turboswitch hdd klck rst connectors correctly reconnected for example turbo switch had three wires and the motherboard connection only two pins and so on does anyone know a solution to this do i need to rewire the connectors or what is the best way to approach this it is somewhat frustrating i got it to work somehow but my turbo switch doesn t work at all i just put replaced the motherboard in a system and had similar questions my cents worth the speaker connector should have two wires going to the speaker a speaker being a coil it s bidirectional and makes no difference which way you attach turbo switch there are three wires to control how you want turbo to become active with the switch pushed in or the switch out i think the middle wire is common use an ohm meter to figure out which wire connects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in and which two wires are connected when the switch is out place the appropriate two wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard led s turbo and hd led s are uni directional depending which way the wires are attached the led will not light on my ami motherboard if the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on the board the board will power up in default in turbo mode if your motherboard is like that just attace the led wires to the board if the led doesn t light power off reverse the connectors and try again it should work if it does then attach the turbo switch to the board hope this helps dan moyer dan moyer columbiasc ncr com
re soundblaster irq and port settings in article s ee tut fi s ee tut fi anssi saari says in apr walter cray com huot cray com tom huot writes i would also like an explanation of this if anyone can explain why the sb pro and lpt can share an irq please do so i think it s simply because dos doesn t use the irq for anything os does so with that you can t share the irq that is correct in dos you can use irq for your sb you can t do that under os because it uses irq for the printer
