cornell edu tedward cs cornell edu edward ted fischer writes for predicting the future it has been entirely meaningless at least if it has meaning we don t know how to find it i did not say i could predict the future you most certainly did i really don t want to get into a didso didnot debate with you but this is somewhat at the heart of our disagreement i did not say nor did i imply that i could predict the future you have inferred that my comments meant this and you have based your rebuttal of my comments on the fact that statistical studies have demonstrated that there is no reasonable basis for predicting future performance in regard to clutch hitting sabo samuel sabo is clearly a better hitter than samuel yet you would pinch hit samuel because you predict that samuel will be a clutch hitter and sabo will be a choke hitter right i d call that predicting the future that is your opinion that sabo is clearly a better hitter than samuel the above data is for a year period ending last season last season samuel batted while sabo hit not park adjusted this season they are both hitting below albeit sabo with more at bats i will agree that over his career sabo has been a better hitter than samuel but i will also remind you that samuel has been a better hitter in certain situations than sabo i did not predict that sabo would choke nor that samuel would get a hit i expressed my opinion that had i been the reds manager or even a reds fan that i would prefer to have samuel hit in that situation than sabo if you were to have been the reds manager at that time i assume you would have had some basis for letting sabo hit rather than pinch hitting samuel i m sure some of that basis would have utilized prior performance you just wouldn t have used this particular aspect of prior performance is this not correct right i would have used aspects of prior performance which have been shown to be consistent in the past overall performance l r splits even matching hitting pitching styles all of these will give me some advantage if used properly ah properly yes i see even if all else were equal there would be no advantage gained by looking at past clutch performance and in this case everything else pointed to sabo please help me what exactly is everything else that pointed to sabo well yes you are aware of its existance you claim to be incapable of understanding it though i suspect you are simply unwilling yet you rather forcefully state the opposite you don t seem to think the work is worth reading yet you obviously feel the topic is important i d say this is insulting i must say i was not aware of the publication can you email me the information regarding its availability and i guess i must apologize to all of those who have done extensive study on say supply side economics i didn t mean to insult you but i never did believe you were on the right path i m sorry for my contrary opinion position i also regret that i don t have the ability to prove that you are wrong but you are i believe that by season s end that chris sabo s batting average in clutch situations will be significantly lower than his batting average in non clutch situations i can t prove that it will happen so i guess we ll just have to wait and see is this simply a prediction for chris sabo for this year or is this a prediction for all batters who have over the past few years hit xxx amount worse in the clutch than overall it is what it says it is if you mean the first then as you say we ll just have to wait and see but the second is a much stronger statement in fact it suggests a rule we can then test this rule on past data to see if it worked for recent years i think you will agree that if the rule didn t work last year or the year before that it is unlikely to do any better this year right the second is your statement not mine i m not going to get into case analysis sure you can find somebody who hit poorly from and then hit poorly in as well you can also find those who hit poorly from and then hit well in well actually i haven t yet but i m not finished looking that is i haven t yet found someone who hit significantly below his overall batting average in clutch situations for the years and then reversed that relationship in gambler s fallacy unless there is reason to expect consistency a run proves nothing can you give us a reason to expect clutch ba to correlate from one year to the next i ve seen a detailed study of why i shouldn t expect it to correlate nope sorry but if you were interested in a reason why i expect chris sabo s ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one year to the next i think i could if you were interested in a reason why i expect joe carter s ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one year to the next i think i could but you re not interested in that because you think that those conclusions could only be valid if they could be extrapolated over the entire baseball population and they can t be the stupid was in reference to a statement which was stupid and i don t see how you can deny it as for total idiot yes if you prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might suggest that you are wrong i would say the term fits nicely the problem here is that i do believe you i accept your work i believe that trying to predict future clutch performance based on prior clutch history is meaningless no better than a coin toss i actually do accept your work as it happens i also have an opinion that in certain situations for certain players a history of superior or inferior ability to hit in the clutch might suggest a reason what such history could be valid in projecting future player performance for that player and chris sabo is one such player so tell me does the term fit or do you have an open mind well since i defer to your statistical wisdom i think i must have an open mind now we have to pose the same question to you the beastmaster mark

they need to act this way not that this fascinates me that much either uh the original author s point was that black and white players were por trayed differently by the media and towards this he gave a highly selected list to prove his case sanders name showed up eventually i dispute that sanders has ever been called lazy by the media hmm big ego possible club house disturbance etc is that good press no but it isn t the total extent of the press he received in pittsburgh where he was called all kinds of things including lazy and spoiled by the local columnists again the actual words used may shift around with time and expediency but lazy tends to be higher on the list for non white players at least in my subjective opinion aside it might be interesting for somebody to do an archival study on player descriptions before and after the color barrier was broken and on teams like the red sox which have been traditionally white nowadays most people think of carl yastrzemski as one of those blue collar hard working guys but in the early s he was often portrayed as a lazy bum really hmm i never heard anyone accuse canseco of being lazy nor sierra i ve heard accusations that canseco was a bad fielder but could be a great one if he put his mind to it ignoring whether or not he is a actually dave stewart is was one of the most vocal about this in any event that is not lazy at least one poster in the last week has fired off a major screed on the canseco is lazy issue so i think your point is at best a quibble and probably weaker than that uh that poster specifically stated allow me to be the first it is not a quibble then to state that the media did not portray canseco as being lazy if the other person chooses to so accuse him after my post that does not make it a quibble and in fact the media around here tend ed to play up his time in the wieght room hardly lazy and hardly a quibble have you ever seen any mediot portray canseco as lazy unconcerned with his fielding yes lazy no bad fielder i think this is still interesting for that matter i think canseco s colorful off field antics get lots more national attention than those of say roger clemens well he s had a few more of them at least more that you ve heard about i think one of the questions here surrounds selective reporting having said that i have to say that the selective reporting hypothesis has the potential to be unfalsifiable at least by those of us who aren t reporters police or private investigators well canseco has been involved in several felonies including his high speed record carrying concealed fire arms and of course the domestic violence clemens had a run in at a bar canseco had that as well and in both cases the coverage was relatively minimal puckett stewart jackson i said over represent non whites three anecdotal data points don t make an interesting counter argument btw which jackson are we talking about here reggie bo darrin danny or uh if the only evidence offered is anecdotal how can it be objected that the counter to it is also anecdotal and it seems like everybody who has ever won a batting title among others has been accused at some time of caring more for his own stats than for the good of the team it also seems to me that you re kirby puckett i have never heard this accusation made of puckett i have heard it of boggs actually i believe it of him but that s another matter not living in minnesota i can t say whether or not this line has ever been used against kirby there as far as boggs goes i m not sure why you bring him up since he s one of the obvious prototypes for the line i quoted along with ted williams rod carew and many others uh yes and i agree with your assesment of boggs rather specifically however you did say everybody who has ever won a batting title has been accused of selfishness i have not ever anywhere heard this said of puckett pendleton either similarly brett b williams and others how about daryl strawberry and i think the plus or minus refers more to the born again types ie butler and gaetti again you seem to be making an argument from anecdotes on the other hand my argument by is of the because jon says so variety if we have no other data i have to admit i have problems generating lists of non white players who became in famous for their religious or political beliefs while names like butler gaetti dravecky knepper hersheiser et al come rolling out there are others perhaps they are simply not as outspoken except in the case of the born again types i mention mike

bowman needs credit during the first three games of the pens devils series i have been impressed time and time again by the pure talent of the pens jagr maceachern and barrasso have been especially fun to watch but one element of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be scotty bowman despite brooks lunatic comments and despite the devils line changing adantage in last night s game bowman has been able to keep his cool and keep the devils in the dark granted the hell dwellers had the pens bottled up for a while last night but bowman was eventually able to configure his line up to get the job done his ability to throw out new looks and strategies at a moments notice is incredible bowman seems to have a terrific ability of reading his players on an individual basis last night for instance he realized that the speed of jagr straka and maceachern was throwing the devils off balance as a result straka received many more shifts than average jagr played almost the entire game he was always on the puck and maceachern scored a goal while complementing jagr many times throughout the night his ability to commit to one player in crucial situations is commendable especially when a coach of such a talented team might simply rely on the overall talent to dominate and to bring about success while no one can replace the genius and optimism of badger bob johnson bowman in his own way has made himself a permanent though not clearly seen mark in pittsburgh

re potvin and his stick in article ps sscl uwo ca ps sscl uwo ca writes dino getting shots in front of the net he should expect it this is playoff hockey where anything goes you lose one game in the regular season and it s not so bad you lose a game in the playoffs and it s a difficult thing to overcome i ve watched hockey and played it too for a number of years and i haven t seen one post season game where the forward in front of the net has not finished without any bruises on the back of his leg the leafs are not doing a good job in clearing the net and potvin has been forced to take matters into his own hands i remember when cicarelli used to play for the london knights ohl he always was a nuisance in front of the net and the goalies took exception to this he also complained in this morning s paper about what happened last night but to me it s a lot of bellyaching his team is up and he complains about being whacked i wonder what would happen if he tried to do the same thing in front of billy smith or a younger ron hextall seems dino would need two artifical legs dino should take it as part of the game and thank his lucky stars that he s in the playoffs and has a good chance to go the finals well i agree that if you re going to stand in front of the net that you should expect to get hit and hacked at in general you should expect to finish the game with some bruises however there is a fine line between hacking at a guy causing some pain and discomfort and blatantly attempting to injure another player felix potvin imo crossed that line on wednesday that two hander on ciccarelli was way out of line i lost a lot of respect for potvin because of that it showed an immaturity he did not slash at ciccarelli to simply try to remove him from the slot area a legal position for dino to be in instead he slashed in an attempt to injure it was out of shear frustration as a leaf supporter just a supporter i m not a leaf fan really i was very disappointed you re right in mentioning billy smith and ron hextall at least in his philly days they both crossed that same line at times and for that reason many fans and players disliked them that s why their names always comes up as examples when we talk about these issues let s hope that felix doesn t do that again i d hate to see anyone even dino although i admit i don t like him very much get seriously hurt from such careless but intentional use of the stick gary

way to go ferraro the isles picked one hell of a time to get their first win all year after being down after periods the caps seemed to have the game in hand playing steady defense and getting great goaltending from tabaracci the isles power play philosophy continues to be dump and chase which except for boardaholics like flatley doesn t work against the caps i hope al realizes this they have too many talented finesse players so why not carry the puck in and set up if last night s game is any omen the isles could be on their way to that ole championship form coming from behind late in a game my advice to the caps is to pounce on those healy rebounds flatley showed alot of heart by playing the last period and overtime despite an almost swollen shut left eye injury suffered at the hands of dale hunter ray ferraro has arrived just in time for the playoffs showing the fiesty hustle that us islander fans remember from an italian from the past john tonelli it was tonelli who won a similar game against the pens in game on the playoffs the isles scored two late third period goals to send the game into ot tied at in ot tonelli scored the game winner to send the isles to the next round the isles have lacked this tenacity for years but perhaps its back it was good to see the coliseum packed just like the ole days good luck to the isles the rest of the way john scialdone scialdone nssdca gsfc nasa gov and the home of the brave jerry garcia bob weir vince welnick april opening day candlestick park

re div and conf names in article apr ramsey cs laurentian ca maynard ramsey cs laurentian ca roger maynard writes there are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the fans i feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties more than names honouring personages i think a compromise would work namely honouring personages in conference names and using geographical references in the divisional names although i still do not think the move will draw fans to the game imo it s a cosmetic change that bettman and the owners hope will have an effect and it doesn t say much for the mentality of anybody it works on either another thing that bothers me is the points system percentages as used in the other major sports are clearly more informative when i look at the nhl standings the first thing i have to do is make a quick calculation to account for games in hand which is almost always the case some will object to percentages claiming perhaps that it is an americanization of the sport surprise i agree totally the points system is fine if everybody at all times has played the same number of games since this is almost never the case winning percentage is the way to go i don t particularly care if it is an american thing either if it works dchhabra stpl ists ca

ghost from sweeney s past wow this guy seems to be out to prove something to his old team boston which sweeney you ask well of course bob sweeney the one that boston let buffalo get a hold of they still have sweeneys which makes things slightly confusing game winner in ot in game and another big goal seconds after fuhr made point blank saves this is why grant has rings to put buffalo ahead in the rd yes neely countered a minute later but hadn t this course of buffalo going ahead after being tied and shutting down another few great scoring opportunities i think boston would have notched their first win of the series well the sabres haven t made it to the end of this series yet but i certainly feel they ve got boston right were they want them actually they ve got them in a position that neither buffalo nor boston felt that would come about one more astronomical game by fuhr a few more heroics by the rest of the team this is a team sport afterall and i think borque neely jouneau sp and company are gonna be swinging a new stick weather is perfect for golf season real soon i m not gonna waiger anything on this because i ve seen some really strange things happen in both pro and college hockey talking about golf was that a hockey swing golf swing or baseball swing that hawerchuck used in the last shot of the game that khmylev deflected in for the big one the whole ot all minute of it was a tesiment to buffalo s ability to really be persistent and grind it out in the end something they weren t necessarily in the regular season the sabres pushed hard and forced borque to blatently take down bodger in the opening seconds i don t normally like penalties being called in such ultra critical points but this was blatent finally the sabres won a faceoff they weren t that hot in this dept the rest of the game when lafontaine scooped at the puck times when hawerchuck took his shot quite a boomer but blue stopped this one he took a few steps over to get his own rebound and slapped at it again without setting it up i didn t realize it went in until the announcer started screaming they score they score the best was seeing lafontaine jumping up and down skating a little bit jumping some more and then skating over to brad may who he jumped on doug mckee mckee cs buffalo edu

re wings will win in article ragraca vela acs oakland edu ragraca vela acs oakland edu randy a graca writes it s true that vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before quinn came but in those years the smythe division was a lot i mean a lot tougher division than the norris also known as the snorris division vancouver had to play edmonton and calgary both very legitimate stanley cup contenders eight times a year while detroit got to play such powerhouses as toronto and minnesota now edmonton is hardly even a force in the league and the smythe even has the mighty san jose sharks while them thar s fighting words hardly a force geez miss the playoffs once in years and even after making the final four times in the last five years and everyone thinks its doomsville over this same period of time in which vancouver was improving so was everybody in the norris except st louis detroit had to improve just to keep up with the competition in their division they had to improve a lot to get better than their competition in the norris bryan murray inherited a team with very little talent for really good players they had yzerman burr and probert and that was about it and no doubt some will dispute whether burr and probert were that good the rest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans the only reason they got as far as they did in the years before murray came was due to the coaching of demers who at least at first got every last ounce of effort possible out of his team then even his coaching began to degrade fedorov primeau kozlov lidstrom sillinger konstantinov drake kennedy racine and cheveldae were already in the pipeline due to devellano murray inherited these guys in addition to yzerman probert carson chiasson etc there are a number of reasons why detroit wasn t in as bad a shape standings wise when murray took over as vanc was when quinn took over some of which i outlined above but murray did not have any better personnel to work with at the outset than did quinn with the exception of yzerman and one player cannot alone make a team into a stanley cup contender as i m sure everyone reading this will agree no quinn had far less murray took over detroit at a time to take advantage of all of devellano s good drafting if devellano had not given in to demers request to make the oates trade he might still be gm gerald

atlanta s abc affiliate sucks i knew despite the lack of a full game telecast last week it was still too much hockey for atlanta atlanta s abc has declined to pick up any playoff games till may and even when they show the games on may and may they will continue to skip the first half hour of the telecast i know this is still a better situation compared to rest of georgia alabama etc but it is still pretty annoying at least in pittsburgh we had a network preemptionchannel which showed all netwoork shows prempted by the local affiliate i asked them what their problem was i told them that a local rating was not that bad considering it was the first nhl game shown after a long time without much promotion besides their syndicated programming in the afternoon is usually low rated so what did they have to lose by showing nhl playoffs she told me that they had contractual obligations i asked her if golf was shown oin abc would contractual obligations come in the way and how come contractual obligations didn t come in the way of last week s telecast she then couldn t give me a coherent answer also i added that atlanta had one of the highest neutral site game attendances and that the demographics were good i think abc and other networks should begin to tie their high rated programs like roseanne in with thier sports programming i hope that everyone in atlanta who reads this bboard calls wsb and complain bitterlyt about this tell them you will stop watching their news telecasts since they seem to be very unprofessional in handling this situation the lady did not seem to settle on a single reason sometimes the reason is low ratings then another time she says contractual obligations

re nords habs in o t we was robbed in article apr jarvis csri toronto edu yaska eecg toronto edu yaska sankar writes paul stewart is the worst and most biased ref presently in the nhl we was robbed no patrick roy is the reason the game was lost and ron hextall is the reason quebec won i don t buy this at all roy was the reason the game was tied and that would not have been the case had dionne kept his cool roy stood on his head for the first minutes of the game when the nords were rushing from end to end kamensky s mini break after the tying goal and the first shot by young in ot were both excellent chances stopped by roy roy outplayed hextall for most of the game but roy becomes the villain and hextall the hero because roy s team didn t make full use of their opportunities whoa what you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays really well he stores up mistakes that can be used at a later time ths is not so roy is the villain as you so succinctly put it because he allowed a very cheap goal if you think roy outplayed hextall perhaps you should get a tape of the game and watch the first minutes of the third period nhl goaltenders make some great saves if they did not they would not be in the nhl in the first place i do not expect any particular goalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time even though they are occasionally required however when it comes to a routine shot like sakic s especially at such a crucial time in a game i don t think there are any legitimate excuses hextall on the other hand had a lot of lucky bounces description of lucky bounces hextall wasn t particularly brilliant on those plays i am not arguing that hextall was brilliant i am arguing is that a relatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result in a goal but it was just the goal the timing stank but against an explosive team like quebec they gave them opportunity too many with a powerplay that was totally unnecessary in a one goal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as just the goal i have not defended dionne for taking the penalty either in fact i think it was a boneheaded move but it led to one goal only and montreal had a two goal lead my main concern is the second goal this most certainly was a team loss leclair missed his opportunities as did bellows and brunet dionne took a bad penalty damphousse and lebeau were silent carbonneau and savard were a step behind all night roy gave up the bad goal roy by no means can be singled out for this loss what you say about the skaters is absolutely true but realize that the game was effectively won you could watch any hockey game in fact you could watch any sporting event period and spend hours discussing the what if s w r t missed opportunities they are not important when the final result is decided if i get the time soon i ll watch the game again and email you a list of lucky montreal bounces and a list of quebec offensive screwups montreal was leading with a minute to go the goalie is the last line of defence and i will grant that extra attention is focussed on him sometimes without justification but roy gave up a lousy goal and a team cannot afford such a goal roy looked like a player in an industrial league on sakic s shot and hextall didn t on dionne s goal please who cares of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally unrelated lousy play i could do a hextall critique if you d like but if you re going to assess his performance keep in mind that he made the key saves at the key times roy is paid big money because that is his value compared to other goalies and he still is in the top for the record i did not say that roy was not one of the top goaltenders in the league in fact i agree that he is the montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory comments against the habs they are no better than uninformed fans i assume you are referring to me however i have pointed out that i think the loss can be blamed on roy i have not said he sucks nor do i think i ve made any other derogatory comments if you regard objective and informed fyi observations as derogatory i really can t help you dchhabra stpl ists ca

re ulf and all allan sullivan allan cs ualberta ca wrote unfortunately that is the way the league is heading you can t fight so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when the ref isn t looking ulf has brought this to a high level players stuck in the past like neely who prefer fights to cheap shots are at a disadvantage in the new system lets face it a cheap shot like high sticking is a very effective method it is easier to hide from the refs has a better chance of causing injury and you can draw people into fights that way i don t like it but that s the way the league is going by the way there was a rather good hit by ulf in the last penguin devil game managed to hit the nj player in the face with a stick must have been a legal hit after all ulf is a clean player and is allowed to do things like that are there any ex nhl hockey players out there who might care to comment on this and end this ridiculously long discussion tom huot huot cray com

bernie nicholls what a man just some thoughts i don t usually like to post simply to make fun of a player but this time i couldn t resist during the pens devils game last night second period i think kevin stevens was in the penalty box nicholls punched kjell samuellson in the face then raised his stick like a two handed sword to defend himself all kjell could do at and pounds was laugh and speaking of swedish penguins defensemen ulf is getting a little out of hand lately his cheap shots are getting more frequent and more violent as everybody in the meadowlands except for the officials could see last night he rammed the butt of his stick down one of the devil s throat i ve always supported the argument he does his job by being irritating but he s starting to push it over the edge imho of course holik s chop to barrasso s neck wasn t too sportsmanlike either it seems that he was following the the only way to beat the penguins is to injure them philosophy as my modern drama professor pointed out to me the other day jagr was stoned pretty well tuesday night and last night as well although the seconds he danced around the devils end was pretty exciting matt at uva

blues shutout hawks again lead series blues shutout hawks again lead series it was a great atmosphere last night at the st louis arena as joseph and the blues shutout the hawks for the second consecutive game people were cheering the blues long before face off time and they kept going for the entire game my friends and i went out celebrating until the early morning hours with some of the players here s a game summary from the st louis post disptach enjoy by dave luecking of the post dispatch staff at p m friday night the arena crowd of paid homage to blues goalie curtis joseph the fans began bowing their arms extended taking the the lead from a fan who held a sign that read only god saves more than joseph it was a fitting tribute to joseph who has brought the blues to the verge of a surprising sweep joseph recorded his second successive shutout friday blanking the blackhawks in game of the norris division semifinals and giving the blues a lead in the best of seven series the blackhawks haven t scored against joseph since the mark of the second period of game joseph has shut out the blackhawks for minutes seconds a blues record jacques plante held the previous record of set in the first round of the playoffs against the philadelphia flyers one of only two series the blues have sweeped in their history the blues can wrap up their first sweep since with a victory in game a nationally televised game that begins at noon sunday the blues have had only two sweeps in franchise history both in when they swept philadelphia and los angeles en route to the stanley cup finals the shutout friday was easier than on wednesday in game when joseph had to make saves this time the blues held the shots down to and the blackhawks couldn t touch joseph well they touched joseph numerous times shoving him and pushing him at every opportunity to try to get him off his game but joseph and the blues were unfazed dishing out their own punishment along the way the blues grinders bob bassen rich sutter kevin miller and dave lowry wore down the blackhawks taking the visitors from chicago off their game the grinders set the stage for the glamour boys the gifted playmakers and scorers who made the most of their opportunities craig janney brett hull and nelson emerson scored getting one goal in each period hull assisted on janney s first period power play goal after two unwise chicago penalties checker miller set up hull s goal in the second period and rookie denny felsner assisted for emerson who scored at of the final period blues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling sweep sweep sweep they also taunted chicago goalie ed belfour bell four bell four they also chanted na na na na hey hey good bye such talk is a tad premature there s still one game left but the blues are on a roll they have the blackhawks on their heels the blues set the tone early on friday with two crunching hits in the first minute of play rich sutter leveled bryan marchment and brendan shanahan dumped steve smith at center ice chicago tried to retaliate but troy murray s decision to run into joseph backfired referee dan marouelli gave him a roughing penalty the blues didn t get a shot on goal on the power play and they survived a scare after chicago killed the penalty when rick zombo gave the puck away to steve larmer joseph stopped larmer s shot and everything else chicago threw at him in the first period the hawks ignored the scouting report on joseph about shooting high and continued to shoot low where joseph s butterfly style is deadly rookie bret hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the period two for hooking and one for holding but chicago got only two shots on goal as many as miller the blues penalty killer twice stole the puck and just missed on good scoring chances against belfour marouelli began calling penalties on the blackhawks to even things up he caught brent sutter hooking shanahan four seconds after hedican s third penalty he called marchment for elbowing janney along the boards at and gave the blues a two man advantage later when christian ruuttu slashed shanahan the blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play and hull got it where he likes it in the high slot hull s shot hit belfour s right shoulder and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line belfour dived back to cover but the puck squirted loose to janney who poked it into the net at for his first goal of the playoffs the blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended and the blackhawks lost their composure joe murphy tripped ron wilson with two seconds remaining in the period and after time had expired smith upset the blues by shooting the puck into the blues bench chris chelios made a move toward joseph as the teams left the ice and marouelli slapped him with a minute misconduct chicago survived the blues power play but the loss of chelios hurt he didn t return until the midway point of the period and within three minutes of his return hull had increased the blues lead to deflecting in miller s crisp pass try as they might the blackhawks couldn t get to joseph who stopped everything they could throw at him he stopped shots in the second period and more in the third chicago also hit the goalpost twice emerson s

leafs win thank you potvin it s about time the boys got it together they were outworked and outplayed by the wings in the first two games but burns must have kicked their behinds cause they sure came out in full gear or is that high gear in game except for a minute stretch in the nd period they outskated and outworked the wings please don t flame this statement cos you know it s true i have to admit that goaltending was the key potvin kept the leafs ahead during the sleepy stretch the leafs went through in the nd he also kept the rebounds to a minimum something that cost cheveldae goals clark even looked like he had stopped moping first star although i still don t know why he was so flat in games and if the leafs play the same style and can keep the pace they had in game they may actually have a chance of winning this series a slim chance but a chance i m no rm where is he anyways haha barfly

re sharks kingston fired snichols adobe com sherri nichols writes in article r v n klh morrow stanford edu steve sep stanford edu steve cole writes i think the three headed gm s guiding principle was to keep veterans in favor of youngsters only if they offered a significant advantage doesn t sound like a bad strategy to me no and in fact that was ferreira s original strategy which the troika proceeded to simply continue to implement there wasn t exactly a radical shift in policy when he was ousted something people seem to forget the only real question is whether they did it as well as ferreira could have if he stayed or whether the basic strategy was flawed since ferreira has been quoated as saying he s going to do something different in anaheim with the ducks my guess is that it wasn t as good in practice as it was on paper and he s tweaking it a bit second time around one also has to wonder whether the strategy would have been a lot better if we hadn t had those injuries and whether we re complaining about the weather because an earthquake collapsed the root cellar of course ferreira had also traded a number of veterans with marginal contributions before he was fired so it s not clear that this would have been different besides they were marginal contributors let s also not forget that ferreira came this close to trading kelly kisio which if the rumors i ve heard are true was over the strong objections of other aspects of shark management and probably had a lot to do with both his ouster and the three headed consensus oriented gm imagine for a second where the sharks would be today if that fax machine hadn t jammed with or without mullen they weren t going to be a playoff team what good does it do them to hang onto a player who d rather be elsewhere especially an unhappy player that isn t playing as well because of it not that i d accuse mullen of tanking but his motivation simply wasn t there and that kind of thing can affect the team an example from this season skriko was brought in on a trial basis but not kept because of his age i thought he was a decent contributor worth keeping around the youth movement has its advantages look at gaudreau who might still be in kc if more veterans had been kept around but you have to find the right balance right balance for what that s the issue exactly at the time they let skriko go we hadn t yet had the major injury bugs that killed us later i d much rather have skriko around than someone like dean kolstad but at that point that wasn t the choice and since the choice was more one of skriko vs someone like john carter i think the right choice was made for that time period chuq imho von rospach esd support training dal aux chuq apple com member sfwa editor otherrealms genie mac bigot alink chuq minor league fans minors request medraut apple com san jose giants a san francisco giants fans giants request medraut apple com the stick not san jose sharks fans sharks request medraut apple com new seat tbd

re sharks review part left wings paul fugu data io com paul brownlow writes wood played most of his junior career in seattle he was one of the leading scorers on a mediocre team when he was traded away in he rarely lost a fight and was one of the toughest players in the whl wood is fairly small for an enforcer type i mean fleury does a pretty good job and isn t that large but dody is no fleury having been witness to three or four of his fights closeup he simply isn t ready to fight at an nhl level assuming that it s his role which is all he really showed us in his few games up from k c if he can pass shoot or skate i never saw much of it all he has is a right fist which isn t bad but at the nhl level the other players are smart enough to grab the thing before he can land anything significant once you control that hand he s a fish flopping on the beach and the other player can do just about anything he wants to him his entire strategy seemed to be keep the hand out of reach until he found an opening and i never once saw him find an opening worth talking about he got neutralized quickly and stomped on a couple of times unless he shows some new tricks in camp he ll be on my career minor leaguer list since this was his first taste of the nhl i expect the sharks gave it to him so he d know what he d have to work on off season he needs to get stronger he needs to get more speed and he needs to show some versatility as something else than a simply goond because he wasn t particularly good as a goon chuq imho von rospach esd support training dal aux chuq apple com member sfwa editor otherrealms genie mac bigot alink chuq minor league fans minors request medraut apple com san jose giants a san francisco giants fans giants request medraut apple com the stick not san jose sharks fans sharks request medraut apple com new seat tbd

re nhl letter roger s response again i assume this is not just flame bait by roger but actually a truly held opinion in article apr ramsey cs laurentian ca maynard ramsey cs laurentian ca roger maynard writes i would say that the letter clearly implies representation of the views of a group that i belong to and i don t share those views and i don t believe that the majority of posters on r s hockey share those views and so i have no intention of allowing them to simply go ahead without making my feelings on the subject clear thanks for speaking for all those who didn t feel it was important enough to say something themselves i wouldn t say that the letter clearly implies representation of the views of a group that you belong to it represents a subset that you don t belong to of a larger group which you do if only because this isn t a moderated group look there are several ways to state an opposing viewpoint three that come to mind are as follows say it subtly result it may not be clear say it directly yet politely result probably it will spark some interesting conversation say it directly and obnoxiously result validity goes right out the window i would agree that unwarranted use of said term is entirely immature you realize that anything you say can and most certainly will be used against you paul w francisco in the shadow an angel cries catcher netcom com front line assembly

makarov in article apr csd newshost stanford edu nlu xenon stanford edu nelson lu writes i don t think the sharks should dig into the free agent market most of the good free agents will require quite a bit of compensation and set the sharks back as far as player development goes remember the sharks were unwilling to give up player s in addition to the million they offered for joe murphy and i think that s a good approach they tried to sign sergei makarov before this season because makarov wouldn t have required compensation matching the makarov offer was the only real mistake dave king has made this year i have to wonder about the intelligence of signing a year old who is obviously on the downside of his career to a year million contract risebrough matched the offer on king s request and makarov has spent the last quarter of the season in the press box because his work ethic just plain stinks not to mention that he s lost a step and can no longer get himself into position to make the nifty passes i think makarov will be available for free this offseason to anybody who agrees to pay his contract he s ineffective in calgary but he might be able to help a team like san jose with their shortage of talent if there s no takers and makarov doesn t show improvement in training camp i think the flames will just bite the bullet and buy out makarov s contract and release him with his current attitude he is a detriment to the team alan
more hart trophy stuff in article r bkvinn nm abyss west sun com dvb ick david van beveren writes when you think of the nhl who comes to mind gilmour gretzky mario ah did i mention mario if you said gretzky you haven t really been following along have you if you said gilmour you are a true maynard i don t even think the selection of the hart deserves serious discussion on this group it is a no brainer while i agree that lemieux deserves the hart it is far from a no brainer the hart trophy goes to the player most valuable to his team not to the best player in the league so your above arguement is really worthless the pens without mario are still a damn good hockey team the leafs without gilmour would have been fighting tampa bay for the rd pick like i said mario deserves it imho but it is a very close race and a gilmour victory would not surprise me i dislike doug gilmour with a passion but i must concede that he is extremely valuable to the leafs alan

re nhl draft cs ariel yorku ca shawn luddington writes as for the picks ottawa picks which means it is almost that alexander daigle will go he ll either stay or be traded in montreal or quebec i dunno about hat i have friends up there on genie who are now saying that ottawa s gone soft on daigle and is thinking hard about pronger daigle has shown an attitude the latter part of this season many folks havne t liked and after coming back from his second multi game suspension for being stupid he s really tanked in his performance his stock is dropping like a rock also remember that a lot of teh draft st stuff comes from the assumption he ll be traded to quebec for lots of prospects it s not clear that quebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him given his current status he s still first round but i don t consider him a first pick lock by any means at this point it s also possible that the senators are posturing to try to bring down his signing price since daigle has been taking some lindros lessons during thos suspensions imo i would take kariya he should alot of leadership in the ncaa and so far in the world championships daigle didn t show this for his junior team san jose will then get kariya no kariya won t go in the first three for a very simple reason he s not leaving college and i don t believe any of the expansion teams are going to use a first for someone who won t be around for another year or two not when there is equally good or almost as good stuff available that can make an immediate impact san jose seems to be leaning heavily towards niedermayer for that reason kariya could go th or th unless a team can convince him to leave school early which i doubt my cut on things as they stand today draft order ottawa daigle if not pronger san jose niedermayer unless ottawa skips daigle then it s open it depends on if the sharks can get a deal for him i don t believe they draft him to keep him tampa bay whoever ottawa doesn t take or maybe koslov chuq imho von rospach esd support training dal aux chuq apple com member sfwa editor otherrealms genie mac bigot alink chuq minor league fans minors request medraut apple com san jose giants a san francisco giants fans giants request medraut apple com the stick not san jose sharks fans sharks request medraut apple com new seat tbd

re camera work on televised games in article apr vax cit cornell edu yecx vax cit cornell edu writes is it just me or is the camera work on some of these games really sad i can t remember how many times during the penguins devils game they showed some guy without the puck being checked in the corner while the puck was being fired on goal in fact i think they even missed one goal completely because they were showing two guys holding each other in the corner now the last time i watched a football game they didn t show the lineman going at it while the running back turned the corner for a touchdown is it just me greg espn has been trying various things to get away from the follow the puck concept of televising hockey games one of the main problems with hockey is that it is very difficult to show everything that is going on more happens away from the puck than in any other sport except maybe football and they can do iso s on football players to be shown between plays the problem of course is that sometimes you get something worthwhile other times you get burned tom galvin galvint taurus cs nps navy mil

playoff consecutive loss record with the recent demise of the chicago blawkhawks much to my delight i noticed their game playoff losing streak to the pens last year and now to the blues and i am wondering what the nhl record for consecutive losses is if there even is one i m pretty sure that the hawks have at least a game losing streak since they ve had to have lost a series since their last championship whenever that was basically i need something else to rag on my hawks fan friend with mike the insomniaced yes rush marillion emerson lake and palmer genesis dream theater mike weintraub aka jvi on irc sig quote du jour mweintr american edu life is like a scissors paper jedi wave cerf net stone game none of the answers the american university is always right but sometimes washington dc each one is neil peart rush go philadelphia phillies and vancouver canucks down to go

fuhr deserves credit was sabres sweep fuhr s role in article revcrinneij shelley u washington edu lzuo byron u washington edu joseph writes in article randolin polisci umn edu randolin polisci umn edu robert andolina writes many people have suggested that fuhr s play is the only reason that the sabres beat the bruins while fuhr was a critical factor i would not overlook the fact that the sabres finally got some scoring from people other than mogilny and lafontaine khmylev sweeney hawerchuck etc indeed lafontaine played hurt and didn t score many goals also the team played better defense although not great than in the regular season fuhr deserves a lot of credit but not all of it robert a i agree with this i also think fuhr s contribution for sabres s win is just the same as many palyers in the team mogilny had six goals in four games including two goals for the great comeback in the final win after fuhr had left the key for sabres s win over boston is whole team s strong commitment as an underdog and all their talent players including mogilny and fuhr i think that grant fuhr deserves more credit than that while it s true that the entire sabres team played very well i still believe that if it wasn t for grant fuhr the series would now be tied he virtually stole games and for the sabres in both of these games fuhr stood on his head to give the sabres the chance to win especially in game fuhr made a series of huge stops in the third period when the score was tied even in game when the sabres won the score seemed to indicate that the sabres dominated however if it hadn t been for fuhr the sabres wouldn t have been up i think it was through the nd period and the bruins wouldn t have had to open up the game thereby allowing mogilny to score the third goal on a breakaway to salt away the game there is no doubt in my mind that fuhr was the critical factor in the victory in my opinion neely oates and juneau played as well as lafontaine mogilny and hawerchuk the sabres did get extraordinary efforts from hannan sweeney wood and khmylev compared to that of the bruins checkers however the bruins defense imo played better than the sabres defense the sabres have ken sutton playing a regular shift afterall the difference in the series was fuhr who outplayed andy moog gary go sabres

re minnesota shame i ve been under the impression that minnesota was one of or possibly the hockey state in the u s so why is the team moving to a city in texas is it that the owner is a greedy self serving profiteer or were the stars really not making a profit or was the city or whoever owned the arena doing some price gouging norman green claims that he has lost money over the last three years that he has owned the team when he bought the team it seemed kind of obvious that he was going to have to deal with a few years in the red before the team started making a profit again he gave the impression that he was willing to do so he claimed two years ago that the team needed to average only fans per game in order to pull a profit but this season the team averaged fans despite increasd ticket prices i think the team s attendence and play was clearly in an upward trend which leaves me dumbfounded as to how he could ignore that in deciding to move he was even offered the many concessions he rudely demanded such as guaranteed season ticket sales cheap rent at the other two arenas in town etc oh well i guess the bottom line is green wanted immediate huge returns in dallas and wasn t willing to wait another year or so in mn dallas gave green a pretty stellar deal to play there although i feel minnesota s was quite reasonable and he also has some cronies down there as well all this means is that minnesota is without an nhl team for a year or two too bad for the nhl kea

re stewart homered the wings in article andy bgsu edu m bgsu edu andy bgsu edu ryan writes roger maynard wrote once again the leafs overcame the red wings in what was possibly the most exciting game played yet in this playoff year perhaps it was the most exciting game played yet that you have seen for most of us who watch teams around the league with interest and objectivity it was nowhere near the most exciting game paul stewart called the single worst game i ve seen this year federov s major was obvious and i don t dispute it however chaisson s penalty shouldn t even have been a penalty let alone a major and a game misconduct the minute game misc call is for high sticking only there is no blood penalty just because chaisson barely touched the poor sap and he hit the dasher and bled profusely doesn t mean it is a penalty unfortunately the instant replay is not used on hits at first i immediately thought and a game because the hit looked much more severe from an intent to injure perspective than it was after seeing the replay i d say it deserved minutes for boarding it was careless any way you slice it if stewart had replay i do not think chaisson would have gotten and the game in the second period behind potvin probert had the puck and was going to get out front and was tackled i couldn t believe the no call this no call was bullshit i agree i admire stewart for letting them go but probert looked up saying where the hell is the penalty i ve never seen probert whine either he doesn t need to now if probie decides to put wendel through the boards he s probably gone right i don t remember who on the leafs touched the puck on racine s shot towards the end of the game seconds left but stewart called it out of play last touched by detroit everybody in the garden including the linesmen knew it yzerman protested but stewart just laughed and really homered the wings this was also bullshit but once again no replay it was rouse btw i m really pissed that the linesmen didn t correct the call either it s b s when the officials refuse to admit they made a mistake but when it all comes down to it wings played like shit yes the calls you describe should not have the difference in a detroit loss i picked the leafs to win game on emotion and adrenalin but the wings have no excuses for game they should be the superior team the call that pissed me off the most was anderson getting for putting his stick in somebody s eye that was the most dangerous stick infraction i have seen in a long time and everybody in the damn league knows he s an asshole when it comes to stickwork four lousy minutes bullshit call murray should send the tape in or a wing should hammer the living shit out of him dchhabra stpl ists ca

finland norway in wc finns had to do their best last night when they played against norway in world champs after two periods the score was still this game was quite much similar to the first game finland played against france the norwegian goalie was very good and a bit lucky too in the third period juha riihij rvi scored from a rebound the time was around mins or so the second goal was scored by kari harila who shot straight from a faceoff behind the nowwegian goalie saku koivu the year old center got his first point of this tournament saku koivu played very well througout the game and he was awarded the best player of the game prize despite the fact that he is quite small in size he handles the puck very well and is a fast skater i think that we will hear from this guy in the future

re blues sweep hawks while i will first congratulate the blues for their victory i think it must be realized that the primary reason the blues were able to win was curtis joseph when a goalkeeper gets hot there is little an opposing team can do joseph should be given the entire city of st louis because otherwise there would probably be a game scheduled as for the game on sunday the blues caught a few breaks without a doubt one was the referee constantly watching the blackhawks looking for reasons to give them penalties second the blues first goal resulted because the puck hit the linesman as the blackhawks attempted to clear no linesman no shot for brett i can redirect anything hull to redirect on another of st louis goals belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someone who didn t belong in the crease which means it was a st louis player finally the overtime goal was caused because someone kept belfour from getting back to the crease no goalie no way to stop the shot i congratulate st louis for beating the hawks it will be a shame to see bryan murray finally advance to the campbell conference finals because joseph won t be able to stop the powerful red wing attack the world reknown jason boskey mail bosk uiuc edu known throughout the world as the bosk christ you know it ain t easy all rights reserved all lefts enhanced you know how hard it can be the way things are goin here they come spinning out of the turn they re gonna crucify me

real fans there was a discussion about how real fans were ones who respect their teams no matter ow bad they are that s bullshit anyone who would follow the pens or the pirates in parts of the early eighties on a devoted basis are losers it s ok to follow and be concerned about your home team but to give them respect even when it is clear the management and the players suck should not be required of a true fan a true fan would follow the team in troubled times to the extent that they could discuss how to improve the team when i visit pittsburgh i ll refuse to go to a pirates game since i think the management has given pittsburgh a team which could have been much better even if they couldn t sign barry bonds lert s say the pens start doing to their own team what the oilers have done this year and what the whalers have done in recent years i would be hard pressed to show much enthusiasm for the team i ll still follow it and bitch about it but i won t waste my money on mediocre teams p ravin ratnam

re hey what about teh cannucks grogers slacvx slac stanford edu greg rogers writes hi all due to living in the bay area i as unable to see vancouver s victory over the jets last night i know the score but that rarely describes the game could someone please post a brief sonapsis sp of waht happened how well did each team play were the cannucks deserving of the victory well in my opinion the canucks played a really strong game i was especially pleased by a very strong game from linden i think he could be a key to success for them this year defensively they really had a strong game hardly heard selanne s name all night craven also played one of his best games since coming over with a few exceptions they really didn t let the high flying jets do much high flying i thought the jets defence looked overmatched by the canucks forwards they will have to improve on that if they want to make this a series in short it was a great start chris roney e mail chris roney sfu ca
canucks over winnipeg the jets gave the canucks another run for their money in an almost identical game to the first of the series but once again came up short as vancouver outscored winnipeg the pattern of the first game was repeated tonight with the canucks scoring quickly and then going to sleep in the second period only to stave off a jet comeback with opportune goals from their greater talent the jets looked more dangerous in this one but it didn t make a difference in the numbers that counted goals vancouver s big line produced again with centre cliff ronning and left winger geoff courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to boost the canucks to a lead on giveaways by the suspect jet defence of bautin and ulanov mental lapses by the defence and goal scoring talent in opportune areas made the difference in all three canuck goals however as in the first game the jets worked hard to take the game to the canucks in the second period the jets dominated the second checking hard and penetrating the vancouver zone without being challenged by a canuck team that wanted to pack it in early the hard work paid off late in the second when tie domi caught vancouver goalie kirk mclean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make the score domi s goal gave the jets new life as they began to take the rush to the canuck s collapsing defence the canucks were unwilling to do anything but let mclean take shots and clear the rebounds the jets were allowed to set up and make plays both goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably mclean made three great saves in the second off a dancing teammu selanne while essensa was rocked by a pavel bure drive selanne looked dangerous on the rush as the jets pressed a series of attacks into the canuck zone the canucks on the other hand looked like they were offering four checking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead a series of minor penalties at the end of the second period resulted in a one man advantage for the jets in the early third the jet s tempo numminen drove a puck from the point through mclean s legs and into the net to tie the game at the canuck s discordant play picked up where it left off this was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected or were picked off by the jets and individual rushes into a tight winnipeg defence that were never supported however as in the first and second canuck goals a jet defensive lapse re bonehead play stalled the winnipeg comeback with the faceoff in the winnipeg zone pavel bure was left to stand in the crease with no jet defender anywhere near him bure who had been invisible in the game up to that point took a rebound and managed to roof it with a backhand even though he was off balance by then it was too late for the jets to come back essensa made it to the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing for their attack canucks winnipeg next game is friday at winnipeg with the jets in the hole by two games

re key registering bodies since the law requires that wiretaps be requested by the executive branch and approved by the judicial branch it seems clear that one of the key registering bodies should be under the control of the judicial branch i suggest the supreme court or regionally the courts of appeal more specifically the offices of their clerks courts already operate substantial record keeping operations some of these records are confidential so the concept of a court holding information in confidence in accordance with law has longstanding legal precedents the judiciary is more immune to pressure from the executive branch than any executive branch agency or contractor can be so judicial control of keys is appropriate for the other half of the key i suggest a unit of congress the general accounting office the gao is congress s staff unit for keeping tabs on the executive branch and has an excellent reputation it s controlled strictly by congress the executive branch has no authority over it with keys split between the legislative and judicial branches we might have a chance of this system working honestly if of course a way can be found to keep the keys from being siphoned off before they reach the repositories this should not be construed as an endorsement by me of the whole clipper concept but if we have to have it splitting control across all three branches of government might make it work john nagle

estimating wiretap costs benefits would wiretap chip be cost effective by robin hanson draft april summary compared to an average monthly phone bill of sixty dollars wiretaps are only worth two cents a month to police so the proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part in three thousand to be cost effective background until now phones have happened to allow the existence of wiretaps detectors which could pick up conversations on a phone line and over time law enforcement agencies have come to rely on this capability to aid in criminal investigations however powerful new encryption technologies threaten this status quo by making possible truly private communication a small chip in each phone could soon make it literally impossible to overhear a conversation without physical microphones at either end in order to preserve the ability of law enforcement agencies to tap phone conversations the u s government announced on april that it had developed and begun manufacturing a special wiretap chip to be placed in future phones instead of the total privacy chips which have been under private development the same day at t announced it would use these chips in all its secure telephone products each chip would be created under government supervision when it would be given a fixed indentifier and encryption key periodically during each conversation the chip would broadcast its identifier and other info in a special law enforcement block law enforcement officers with a court order could then obtain the key corresponding to the indentifier from special trust agencies and could thereby listen in on any future or previously recorded conversations on that phone to date most concerns voiced about this plan have been about its security the government won t disclose the encryption algorithm and many suspect the government will not limit its access in the way it has claimed the track record of previous governments does not inspire confidence on this point however this paper will neglect these concerns and ask instead whether this new wiretap chip is a cost effective tool for police investigation that is which is a cheaper way for society to investigate crime force phone communications to support wiretaps or give police agencies more money to investigate crimes in other ways or to put it another way would police agencies be willing to pay for each wiretap if they had to pay their share of the full social cost of forcing phones to support wiretaps to start to answer this question we might compare the current benefits wiretaps provide to law enforcement agencies with projected costs of implementing the new wiretap chip plan and since current benefits are easier to estimate we begin there wiretap benefits is the latest year for which wiretap statistics are available in that year wiretap installations were requested and no requests were denied this figure does not include wiretaps obtained with the consent of a party to the conversation arrests resulted from wiretaps started the same year arrests came from wiretaps in previous years and of arrests led to convictions of the wiretaps were for phones vs pagers email etc were regarding drug offenses and were requested by federal authorities each wiretap installation heard an average of calls of them incriminating among people and cost an average of extrapolating from the installations reporting costs mostly for labor thus a total of about million was spent on wiretaps to obtain about arrests at per arrest thus these arrests are at least four times more expensive than the per arrest figure one gets by dividing the billion spent by all police nationally by the total million non traffic arrests thus the million per year spent on phone taps is only one thousanth of the total police expenditures and if we divide this by the million phone access lines in the country we get about cents spent per year per phone line or about two cents a month in general we deter a given class of criminals through a combination of a perceived probability of being caught and convicted and some expected punishment level if convicted so the social value of having wiretaps is no more than the amount that we would have to pay to get the same criminal deterrence through other means if unable to wiretap a particular suspect s phone police might instead use hidden microphones or investigate that suspect in other ways or police might focus on suspects more easily investigated without wiretaps or we might raise the fine or prison time for certain types of crime if we generously assume that these substitutes for wiretaps would be on average twice as expensive as wiretaps then the annual social benefit of phone wiretaps is about equal to the current spending level of two cents a month per phone line wiretap costs let us for the moment optimistically assume that the us government encryption scheme is as secure as whatever private enterprise would have offered instead protecting our conversations from the spying ears of neighbors corporations and governments both foreign and domestic even so the need to support wiretaps would add many additional costs to build and maintain our communication system extra law enforcement blocks would be added to phone transmissions increasing traffic by some unknown percentage a special process must be used to add encryption keys to chips while securely distributing these keys to special agencies which must be funded and monitored the chips themselves are designed by a military contractor whose design is to remain secret and are manufactured through a special process so that the chip becomes nearly impossible to take apart chips are now offered at the relatively high price of a peice in lots of private encryption systems not supporting wiretaps would require none of these extra costs perhaps most important government degree would at least partially replace private marketplace evolution of standards for how voice is to be represented encrypted and exchanged in our future phones it is widely believed that governments are less efficient than private enterprise in procuring products and standards though they may perhaps perform a useful brokering role when we choose between competing private standards how much less efficient is a matter of debate some say they pay twice as much while others might say only more currently a total of billion is spent as operating expenses of u s phone companies which comes out to about per month per access line if we compare this to the wiretap value of two cents per month we see that if wiretaps raise average operating costs by even as much as one part in then wiretaps are not cost effective and this doesn t even include extra costs phone owners pay because their encryption chips are more expensive of course most phones wouldn t have encryption chips for a while but the wiretap benefit per phone is still the same so this argument still applies conclusion given this dramatic difference between the total cost of running the phone system and the value of wiretaps we can justify only the slightest modification of the phone system to accommodate wiretaps when the only modification required was to allow investigators in to attach clips to phone wires wiretap support may have been reasonable but when we consider substantial modification the burden of proof is clearly on those proposing such modification to show that the costs would really be less than the benefits if consensus cannot be obtain on this cost benefit estimate a compromise might be to tax phones which do not support wiretaps at a rate of say five cents per month a tax payable to police agencies nationwide to compensate them for their loss of wiretap abilities the invisible weapon

thoughts and questions i just joined this group recently and really do not know much about cryptography but a couple things came to mind while reading through the posts is the clipper chip going to be exported if not how will people communicate with other countries will they have to do that in un crypt mode will other encryption techniques be legal assuming the government cracks down on using others when going overseas but not within the states i ve read about authentication systems that use an electronic security card that looks like a calculator to create an encrypted pin based on the time date the host system has the algorithm built into it as well so that it can authenticate a user is there some form of encryption technology that would create keys that are only valid at a certain instant in time the systems would then allow a window of time around this instant where the key would work i realize that this technique would increase the amount of information needing to be stored because you would need entire algorithms rather than just keys but for smaller scale things it might work could some similar method be used to make the two bit keys that are issued to police fbi etc to tap a phone only usable for one week for instance if further surveilance was needed they would have to go back to the escrow service to get another key this would make it useless for local police to database keys they have used i assume this is not possible because the receiving phone would need to be able to decypher the message but any thoughts on the subject thanks tauren mills tauren mills tauren rigel cs pdx edu

new encryption algorithm ever since craig rowland posted his piece new encryption to sci crypt there has been some discussion of our company secured communications technologies inc and on encryption algorithm nea i spoke to craig at length on and we covered a lot of ground some of the information in the posting requires some clarification and i would like to answer some of the questions raised on sci crypt sct is a small company based in silver spring maryland our two main products at this time are a pc based secure communications program called secom and a general purpose encryption chip which uses the nea algorithm developed for secom secom provides an encrypted secure communication link between two pc s connected over dial up telephone lines it supports simultaneous bi directional file transfer and keyboard to screen chat it has its own proprietary communications protocol which is tightly integrated to the encryption all though it is a packetized link the data stream appears to be continuous because the packet boundaries are hidden when secom was initially developed it was implemented to use des encryption a business decision was made to seek export approval for the product because it was perceived that the overseas market was a large one and provided a good marketing opportunity we soon found out that we would never be granted general export approval for anything using des all though the reason for this was never explicitly stated it seems to have something to do with secret government to government agreements which are still in effect in any event the decision was made to develop a new and different algorithm which would take the place of des this was the reason nea new encryption algorithm was born at this time nea is being held as a trade secret the preliminary work of patenting it has begun and the plan is to make it public once the patent process is complete all though one can make certain legal arguments for keeping it an ongoing secret i think in the case of an encryption algorithm it is necessary to let people shoot at it over an extended period of time to prove its worth in order to get export approval for secom nea it was necessary to go through nsa and to reveal to them the details of the program and algorithm this was done only after we had a finished product to submit let me state unequivocally that there is no back door to the program or the algorithm secured communications technologies is a closely held private company and nsa fbi cia nist whatever has no financial interest in any way whatsoever with the company or any of the people involved from a practical business standpoint we are interested in selling chips and software hopefully in large quantities and a back door to the encryption if found out could destroy our credibility and our business with the encryption algorithm approved for export we set out to talk to a number of potential customers for encryption products and systems we were able to identify several common threads of functionality requirements this led to the design of a chip with the encryption algorithm cast in silicon and certain other capabilities added so that the chip could fulfill the broad range of requirements that we identified we are strongly opposed to the clipper capstone chips in a press release today our president dr stephen bryen stated it seems as if the government has an unlimited source of funds to use to push its new bugged chips on the american public but do we not understand how the national security agency which is not supposed to be involved in domestic spying can fund the development of a commercial chip intended to accommodate u s government domestic spying activities if they had asked me to put a back door in nea i would have told them to g f ed can nsa break nea or for that matter can they break des rsa idea diffy hellman pgp rc rc or whatever i don t know and probably never will

re the clipper chip a technical summary in article apr guvax acc georgetown edu denning guvax acc georgetown edu writes the following document summarizes the clipper chip how it is used how programming of the chip is coupled to key generation and the escrow process and how law enforcement decrypts communications interesting tell us what happens if i were to say ok i want to have something else if the law enforcement wants my traffic they can record it then get a search warrant and get the keys from me just like they would the keys to a stout private safe etc lets say i suspect that there is a way to trivially crack this at the fed level with no warrant say for nsa scanning for keywords etc and the government has abused great power in the past so i say mr vendor i want something different independent i am a paranoid sort ya understand will the result be sorry without government permission we cannot sell you anything secure or would it be sorry we know which side our bread is buttered on we cannot sell except to government people law enforcement and special people what in your opinion would be the chances of sure we will sell you this secure system be happy to also please be so kind as to tell us what the plans are for private encryption of say files transferred by modem or ftp or data stored on disk surely you have a feel for what the administration is planning for us people on that with your rather intimate relationship with the fbi nsa etc you must certainly have an idea you are surely not going to say the people are not to know until it is too late this is supposed to be government of the people by the people isn t it that is the people are the government s bosses the bosses want to know what the is going on here you see i am kind of nervous because in the last month or so i have seen a non stop stream of ideas coming out of wash dc that at least appear very strongly to have a common trait to limit privacy freedom from govt eavesdropping and the ability to defend ourselves against violent attack no is not good enough for common folk they arrive only in time to clean up the mess i would be dead if i had to depend on you see with all that talk about national smart id cards limiting of encryption to government approved denial of means to effective personal defense eight bills in congress right now it looks an awfully lot like the whole thing is to be able to trace every activity of an individual from cradle to grave all it would take is requiring that national id card to be used in all transactions and with no effective data protection and with the people suitably disarmed there would not be a helluva lot they could do about it now would there all in the name of the war on the constitu er drugs and of course that catch word terrorists what is wrong with good old fashioned police work to build a case they don t want to have to be burdened to leave the office it seems please read the bill of rights first ten amendments to the us constitution and tell us how you can reconcile this big brother ish policy of the administration always for a crisis of some kind isn t it with that bill of rights in the context of the people who wrote it reassure us please or is that no longer regarded as necessary seeing as apparantly the people have no input on this agenda the administration preferring to make all the decisions in secret then springing it on us doesn t sound much like by the people to me i cannot help notice that the congress people involved were not mentioned on the press release i find that more than a little bit curious don t you i sure would like to know who to not vote for come election time yes i am upset i feel you are a part of this because i recall it was you that was posting heavily in favor of a very similar idea could have been the same thing it was so close a few months ago i also recall it was not well received apparantly powers that be really didn t care or were not told or both from what i see clipper will only be useful for conversations i don t want the neighborhood kid listening in on any serious security i don t think i would want to trust it a bit might as well use cleartext certainly corporations would be rather dumb to depend on this for serious trade secret data especially if millions depended on that security given enough money one could buy any keys they wanted buy a crooked judge and a crooked cop given a few hundred thou they wouldn t be hard to find so we end up with only criminals terrorists and the government with real security and the ability to eavesdrop you know the first two if they are serious ain t going to use this thing for their communications i bet the government won t either except perhaps to order a pizza tell us will that be prima face evidence of criminal activity someone not using the government approved methods that just a desire to have privacy is no longer regarded as a legitimate right of an unconnected citizen will that be grounds for a fly through the door raid and confiscation of all one s equipment as terrorist tools using civil forfeiture so there will be no inconvenient need to prove any wrongdoing on the part of the citizen i have yet another question are we going to see articles in all the public magazines consisting of soothing text telling us how great this is how nice the government is by letting us have this illusion of privacy that the government is going to be so kind as to let us sort of exercise a right what you want to bet that i am correct here please answer these questions as citizens of the united states we hava a right to know what our government plans to let us have out of the goodness of their hearts funny thing though with all these proposals i don t feel one bit safer from drug dealers terrorists or a common street thug i am beginning to wonder if the greater danger lies in the above entities or our own government gone out of

re fear uncertainty doubt more accurate is that the government says its solid other people in the field who might be able to find out haven t yet done their review of the chip design and there s been a lot of wild speculation and guesswork from those with little information that it might be swiss cheese oh that puts the debate on excellent terms for our side feds you people saying that clipper is insecure don t have any real information to support that judgment me fine show me this information that would prove me wrong feds that s secret when it comes down to that it looks suspiciously like some government official pasting top secret stamps over embarrasing information in order to save his own hide in fact framing the secrecy issue in that perspective is more likely to turn joe sixpack s suspicions against the feds than the constitutional argument a point i urge the others on the pro freedom side to consider when making their case
re clipper considered harmful the clipper chip s user key is formed by r e d e n s s s r e d e n s s s r e d e n s s s why is the triple encrytion used is it just to gain an effective increase in keyspace to defeat a potential keysearch if so why use bit keys not knowing anything about the skipjack algorithm it s not really possible to guess whether this makes it harder or easier to guess s s why are n n and n formed as they are it would be facinating to see the skipjack algorithm to look for ways of attacking it that require three ciphertext blocks formed in that odd way where do the bit constant values that are concatenated with the serial number to form n n n come from are they changed from chip to chip or session to session even if they re published in the ny times if skipjack is resistant to known plaintext attacks when using triple encryption then there s no break in security but why allow that kind of weird format if those three bit values are truly random bits then maybe it s used to ensure that a known plaintext attack on skipjack if it exists can t be easily used to derive s and s for a whole production run of these chips does dorothy denning read this group if not is someone on the group forwarding questions like these to her or martin hellman or anyone else who s seen more details about the chip john kelsey
re is key escrow enough the points raised about checking what is actually in the chip as opposed to what is allegedly programmed therein raise yet another trust issue even if we assume that these trusted agents are really entering a wide range of s and s seeds rather than using the same one all the time to reduce the key search space to bits i assume they are not doing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry at carefully selected points to encode data they would presumably be punching numbers into a computer which for all they know could program the chips in a manner completely independent of the s and s values they are feeding into the system

clipper freedom comments begin pgp signed message gasp i ve just spent hours catching up on sci crypt here slow reader i guess and i really have to put out a few comments too first let me flame the famous dave s he s obviously only years old cut him some slack the joke about clinton crypto drugs slammed me thru the roof nice job guys i ve been working on marijuana legalization for over years now clinton s actions so far have really helped but because of government action taken against various other groups i have developed a bit des based on public literature to protect my mailing list the s boxes are the critical component and since i chose out of based on the key cracking this des is going to tough the reason it slows you down a touch is that for each key you try you need to use a different set of s boxes i know it s only a vector but it sure makes random search a pain several marijuana legalization groups have had their mailing lists confiscated when people were charged with drug use sales it s not a crime to be a member of a legalization org but you will be watched it really is important to write a letter to every official you personally vote for to explain why your privacy is being destroyed by the cripple chip amazingly enough they do listen when they get enough mail the doonsbery jokes about nra postcards are real and the imi illinois marijuana initiative has grown to the point where we are seeing some changes it s pretty clear that all the hullabaloo is really about the implimentation decision being made behind our backs as vesselin points out this was common practice in communist regimes and may be again depending on how the vote goes but just as criminals have guns and law abiding citizens don t and criminals like me have marijuana and law abiding subjects don t criminals like me will have secure crypto while law abiding robots don t pgp is nice but as time goes on we all can do better and to save our hides we will someone posted an excerpt from machiavelli he s my favorite dude years ago he saw clearly how people are and tried to explain that to princes who wanted people to obey one section not quoted i ve got the prince at home so i ll just paraphrase had to do with conquring a free city the only way is to completly destroy it failing that you must appoint locals to high positions and accept the people s customs even after years of oppression a people will remember their heratige and rise up to overthrow the oppresive government and he gave an example and that was years before thomas jefferson there were questions about watching traffic only interesting traffic is watched stuff that goes overseas and comes back stuff with keywords like marijauana cryptography nsa certain individuals who are known subversives etc it is easy enough to store all that traffic so if you know how to be subversive i e how to be unseen it s pretty easy to go unnoticed for a long time the stronger your crypto system and the less you re noticed the better your chances of developing an organization which can diseminate truth to the masses which gets me to the thread about a public encrypted conference that s just silly the first thing the feds do is send in an infiltrator like dave s and they know what you re doing it will be fun for teenagers and college students but for the real world it s pretty pointless crypto is useful for more things than hiding where you get your marijuana guns drugs and crypto do have some commonality there are people in government who want you to obey their rules as lundquist says in alt drugs live free or don t machiavelli pointed out that s just how most people actually live inspite of appearences to the contrary it s true that the decision to shove the clipper not the same thing as intergraph s down our throats violates the principles of what the u s was founded on but the government is full of idiotic robots called bureaucrats and there s less to worry about than one might think only really innocent read naive subjects of the u s will be hurt by this the rest of us criminals will live in secure freedom de toqueville pointed out years ago that the tyranny of the majority will be mitigated by the mediocrity of the government and given what i see government officials doing where i work argonne national lab the level of stupidity makes dave s look smart patience persistence truth work dvader hemp imi hep anl gov dr mike home mrosing igc org

summary responses research on oracle password security my original post was i am building an oracle v database to serve as a repository for information which is considered proprietary or confidential as such i want to verify the security of oracle passwords and apply some of the same security checking techniques we use on our nix systems specifically i would like to use crack or something like it to check the encrypted data for easily guessed passwords the use of crack would depend on oracle using the unix password encryption scheme does anyone know if this is the case or what method is used any other methods for security checking audit in the oracle environment would be much appreciated this article will just scratch the surface of a few security considerations comments are requested email fw world std com my thanks to the people who responded both on usenet and from oracle corp the most common response was to suggest use of oracle audit features or ops passwords to control access opinion on ops included suggestions to use and not use i was also advised to use table views to refine the granularity of access control one important security consideration in networked installations is that ops accounts presume that the client host provides user authentication os server ops users are only as secure as the least secure machine on the network hence you should probably not define any ops accounts on systems with pc s or limit access of ops accounts to data with no security concerns unix oracle servers provide for disabling ops access over the network orasrv option while relying on host security for local processes internally oracle provides powerful and well documented sic audit mechanisms which the dba will use to monitor system and data access these tools can be used to track the primary security risks from within the oracle environment oracle password security is based on a proprietary usage of des encryption oracle corp states that the algorithm is not prone to cleartext attack this is a difficult claim to substantiate since the algorithm is unknown the concern here is that if users choose easily guessed passwords if a cracker can gain access to your oracle database files through the host operating system s he could extract the cyphertext password data and apply cryptanalysis techniques to learn the users passwords as security risks go the above scenario is pretty low severity certainly once an intruder has access to the raw database files s he can access to the data in them if a cracker could break the passwords however s he could do substantial damage without alerting the auditing mechanism s and leaving and audit trail which would point to valid users at present oracle like unix provides no native means of ensuring that passwords are not guessable as with all computer security the most important defense is to educate users in the safe choice of passwords these techniques are well discussed in internet rfc and the crack manual both available from ftp archive servers and unix r system security curry david a addison welsey forrest whitcher fw world std com boston scientific corp watertown ma

a parable scottmi microsoft com scott miller techcom writes stikes me that all this concern over the government s ability to eavesdrop is a little overblown what can t they do today my understanding is that they already can tap listen get access exc to our phone lines bank records etc etc again well they can t listen in on much of mine since i already use cryptography for much of my electronic mail and will start using it for my telephony as soon as practical however allow me to tell a parable there was once a far away land called ruritania and in ruritania there was a strange phenonmenon all the trees that grew in ruritainia were transparent now in the days when people had lived in mud huts this had not been a problem but now high tech wood technology had been developed and in the new age of wood everyone in ruritania found that their homes were all see through now until this point no one ever thought of allowing the police to spy on someone s home but the new technology made this tempting this being a civilized country however warrants were required to use binoculars and watch someone in their home the police taking advantage of this would get warrants to use binoculars and peer in to see what was going on occassionally they would use binoculars without a warrant but everyone pretended that this didn t happen one day a smart man invented paint and if you painted your house suddenly the police couldn t watch all your actions at will things would go back to the way they were in the old age completely private indignant the state decided to try to require that all homes have video cameras installed in every nook and cranny after all they said with this new development crime could run rampant installing video cameras doesn t mean that the police get any new capability they are just keeping the old one a wise man pointed out that citizens were not obligated to make the lives of the police easy that the police had survived all through the mud hut age without being able to watch the citizens at will and that ruritania was a civilized country where not everything that was expedient was permitted for instance in a neighboring country it had been discovered that torture was an extremely effective way to solve crimes ruritania had banned this practice in spite of its expedience indeed why have warrants at all he asked if we are interested only in expedience a famous paint technologist dorothy quisling intervened however she noted that people might take photographs of children masturbating should the new paint technology be widely deployed without safeguards and the law was passed soon it was discovered that some citizens would cover their mouths while speaking to each other thus preventing the police from reading their lips through the video cameras this had to be prevented the police said after all it was preventing them from conducting their lawful surveilance the wise man pointed out that the police had never before been allowed to listen in on people s homes but dorothy quisling pointed out that people might use this new invention of covering their mouths with veils to discuss the kidnapping and mutilation of children no one in the legislature wanted to be accused of being in favor of mutilating children but then again no one wanted to interfere in people s rights to wear what they liked so a compromise was reached whereby all homes were installed with microphones in each room to accompany the video cameras the wise man lamented few if any child mutilations had ever been solved by the old lip reading technology but it was too late the microphones were installed everwhere however it was discovered that this was insufficient to prevent citizens from hiding information from the authorities because some of them would cleverly speak in languages that the police could not understand a new law was proposed to force all citizens to speak at all times only in ruritanian and for good measure to require that they

makes any big dent in crime anyway all it does is make our privacy forfeit to the state however the wise man made the mistake of saying this as the law required in ruritanian clearly and distinctly

re can des code be shipped to canada in article strnlghtc wkrt ja netcom com strnlght netcom com david sternlight writes i believe it is illegal to send any cryptographic code out of the country without an export license others will correct me if this is inaccurate glad to you are correct it is illegal to send cryptographic code and lots of other things out of the country without a license however every us citizen has a general export license allowing export of lots of things including constitutionally protected speech this has the effect that it is legal for us citizens to export some things which it is illegal for a us corporation to export without first obtaining a license dunno if you d get one for the particular code you have the only way to find out is to apply for a license nope talk to a good lawyer in the area of export law but in general the government has to have a very good national security case to try prevent the export of anything you personally might wish to publish yes i worded that the way i did intentionally it is a lot easier for the government to try to prevent the export of information than to charge someone with a crime after the fact espionage is probably the only exception note that you need to distinguish between what is legal to send to canada if you have such a license and what is legal to send if you don t if you are a us citizen you have a general license i am not a lawyer so take some of this with a grain of salt however i have also had to swim through both itar and export regs in a few cases robert i eachus with standard disclaimer use standard disclaimer function message text in clever ideas return better ideas is

how to make the clipper chip and wiretapping less bad i ve got an idea that would remove most of the political complaints i have about the clipper chip pass a law stating that if within a year of performaing a wiretap on someone a police agency hasn t managed to convict the suspect of the crime the warrant wiretap was for then that agency owes the suspect million to repay him her for lost privacy of course there are still problems with the technical aspects of clipper and with the one size fits all mentality that would be behind an attempt to enforce it as a standard but this would be a way for those in favor of allowing continued wiretaps to assure us that it will only be used in cases where the crime is important and the police are all but certain that there really will be a conviction john kj elsey

re clipper considered harmful restated and amplified in article apr lehman com pmetzger snark shearson com perry e metzger writes you obviously haven t read the information about the system the chips put out serial number infomation into the cypher stream to allow themselves to be identified the system does not rely on registering people as owning particular phone units i am against the proposal but lets be accurate in our objections do not presume to tell me what i have and have not read the system may not rely upon registering people as owning particular phone units but it is necessary to know which phone units are likely to be used for some suspected criminal communication before you can obtain their unit keys from escrow this necessity raises the stakes in favor of a criminal s coercing or colluding use of some other person s clipper phone i will restate my assumptions more explicitly and amplify my argument the original title perhaps should have been distinction between legal and illegal cipher systems considered harmful but clipper considered harmful is not inaccurate and is more eye catching in the current context assumptions clipper is made available laws are passed to make use of cipher systems other than clipper illegal either on radio systems or on any common carrier system these laws also include enforcement authority to listen across the relevant radio spectrum or other medium characterize signals validate clipper wrappers detect probable use of non clipper ciphers and make such detection a cause for further action for escrowed keys to be useful some specific clipper chip must be associated with a suspected criminal this means that at a minimum some association between the common carrier s unique phone id esn and the clipper chip serial number n will be stored in a government database an observed pairing of n and esn other than the one recorded raises a red flag to reduce ordinary fraud the cellphone system which offers clipper will also be constructed with an esn mechanism much more tamper proof and much less spoofable than today s cellphones criminals want inscrutable communications some criminals are not entirely stupid or ignorant and will figure out both that clipper cellphones offer excellent security in normal circumstances and that they offer no security against law enforcement once a presumably legitimate wiretap order exists they will also figure out that the wiretap order must necessarily be against a specific cellphone because each one has a unique unit key criminals do not want to call attention to themselves because they are not stupid or ignorant or because they read netnews and because they know that their open use of a non clipper cipher is likely to be detected they will generally avoid using non clipper ciphers directly on some monitorable tappable channel they know that do so would raise a red flag putting a given cellphone if not a given person under immediate suspicion it is impractical to reverse engineer skipjack discover family key f and construct a functional clone of a clipper chip by and it will be very difficult to spoof a given clipper phone without immediate detection because it is difficult to obscure one s association to a specific phone by reprogramming or changing chips around the criminal will be motivated to find an intact phone which is associated with someone else a non stupid criminal will conclude that they can have clipper secure communications at least for some limited time t if they buy beg borrow or steal use of someone s phone in a way that prevents that person from reporting compromise of the phone for at least time t the encrypted communications might have been recorded and thus be retrievable later but the criminal can delay and quite likely evade discovery by destroying or abandoning the phone before t elapses it would be unusual for an innocent person to volunteer use of their clipper phone to someone else the honest subscriber doesn t want to pay someone else s bill and he doesn t want to fall under suspicion this leaves two sources of clipper phones for criminal use coercion and collusion coercion first theft bears a relatively low risk but also sometimes a low time until detection a few minutes if a phone is stolen from a car parked in front of a store a couple of weeks if a phone is stolen from someone who is away on vacation criminal commerce is likely to arise in stolen clipper phones with phones coming from risk inured poor criminals and cash coming from risk averse wealthy criminals someone who is extraordinarily motivated to gain a day or two of undetected communication like a terrorist could kill a person or hold them hostage the limited time before detection that a coerced phone is useful means that continuing criminal enterprises require a continuing supply of freshly coerced phones there would also be created a collusive commerce between relatively wealthy criminals and ignorant or don t care patsies who need money and who will submit to being paid in return for subscribing to clipper phone service for someone else s use criminals will learn that it is more to their advantage to coerce use of a clipper cellphone than it is to apply a non clipper cipher to a normal cellphone they will call much less attention to themselves or at least to their stolen phone this way the fact of a phone s use being coerced must first be reported before it can be identified as an interesting phone and have its keys obtained from escrow clipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to conceal use of super encryption an automated full system surveillance mechanism quite feasible across radio bandwidth which knows family key f can validate clipper wrappers and n esn associations but it cannot reveal in realtime the use of super encryption unless it knows all unit keys which we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate pieces upon specific wiretap like order whereas a criminal s use of any cipher within a normally cleartext medium would stand out a criminal s use of a non clipper cipher within a clipper medium would be very difficult to detect even ex post facto in bulk recordings as long as the association between criminal and specific clipper chip is fractured if you make use of this other cipher illegal per se then you can charge the criminal with this if you can identify the true criminal he ll be using someone else s phone but you ll have no evidence to help you against whatever traditional crime he might have been planning you will not even be able to detect that unusual encrypted communications are occurring until you identify specific phones and obtain their keys from escrow the gangster and terrorist are thus arguably more not less secure than they were before clipper came along i therefore consider clipper harmful because it does not provide absolute privacy to the honest public against aggressive or dishonest government if other ciphers are proscribed it engenders new types of direct criminal threat to the honest public it provides an extraordinarily effective mechanism for criminals to hide their use of some other cipher making it more difficult than ever even to gain notice that unusual communications are occurring and that plans for some criminal act might be in progress if other ciphers are proscribed lazy investigators and prosecutors are more likely to pursue the easily quantifiable cipher use crime than they are the traditional and directly harmful crimes which key escrow is claimed to help against if other ciphers are proscribed the stage is set for witch hunting of illegal cipher use because any computer can be used as a cipher machine

clipper serial numbers need nd court order something that no one has discussed yet or i missed it the fbi sets up a wiretap after the court order was handed only at this point they can access the line and detect the serial number n what happens next does the fbi simply asks for the keys for n and since a warrant was issued for the line the fbi simply gets it what if multiple phones are used from the same house the fbi just asks for n n etc exactly who is to prevent the fbi from claiming some other serial number x was also used over the wirtapped line and get the keys for x either a second court order for the specific serial key is required and i have seen no indication of this or the fbi can effectively ask for any pair of keys at any time so the escrow key holders are a total fake an unrelated issue if and when all phones always use the clipper chip how are call transfers going to take place michael golan mg cs princeton edu

re clipper chip and crypto key esc in article apr memex co uk peter memex co uk writes i thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some intermediate point on the line maybe they have taken a crash course in data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the digital stream for decryption later this would still suffer from the called babt it has been stated either here or in the uk telecom group that they will not approve equipment that does encryption i don t know if this is true or not but this would make a good test case peter ilieve peter memex co uk you forget the obvious if it is an authorised tap then it can be done at the exchange if the exchange is digital then i suspect that you can auto monitor a line and pickup the full link therefore syncing a piggyback modem on the line would not be impossible i suspect mike h mike avon demon co uk

re clipper considered harmful in article bb f c mizzou missouri edu c mizzou missouri edu john kelsey writes the clipper chip s user key is formed by r e d e n s s s r e d e n s s s r e d e n s s s why is the triple encrytion used is it just to gain an effective increase in keyspace to defeat a potential keysearch if so why use bit keys not knowing anything about the skipjack algorithm it s not really possible to guess whether this makes it harder or easier to guess s s why are n n and n formed as they are it would be facinating to see the skipjack algorithm to look for ways of attacking it that require three ciphertext blocks formed in that odd way where do the bit constant values that are concatenated with the serial number to form n n n come from are they changed from chip to chip or session to session even if they re published in the ny times if skipjack is resistant to known plaintext attacks when using triple encryption then there s no break in security but why allow that kind of weird format if those three bit values are truly random bits then maybe it s used to ensure that a known plaintext attack on skipjack if it exists can t be easily used to derive s and s for a whole production run of these chips i can t answer all our questions in detail but i can take a stab at them the form the operations that compute r r and r is of course the famous triple encryption suggested for use with des it s much stronger than a single encryption and has an effective key length of bits for reasons that were discussed when des was first standardized a simple double encryption would not have the same strength triple encryption has been used by ibm since more or less the beginning to encrypt other keys it s recommended for anything of very high value and i think we can agree that the r i and s i fit that description why n n and n well you need different plaintext values i have no idea if they ll be disclosed or not at a guess they re constructed so that they differ in as many bit positions as possible a goo cryptosystem will scramble things a lot with even a bit change but the values of n in a series will have fairly similar bit patterns and there might conceivably be a weakness so the n i values are and i m guessing chosen to increase the hamming distance in any event i m quite convinced that one cannot go back to the s i from the u i let alone u observe if the nsa has u they don t need to find s i but even if they do they can t get u and u in theory they should never even see those values even with a warrant the real question i think is why use this scheme at all as opposed to a hardware random number generator my answer is that this is much more verifiable look suppose that nsa nist the aclu the eff and the nra combined to build a really good random number generator and that it passed every test you could think of when you come back next week to program some more chips does it still work that well have any components changed in value have the components been changed out from under you does it still work well the in the presence of a focused microwave beam that tends to bias it towards selecting bits yes you can run detailed statistical tests on it again but that s hard consider on the other hand a software solution you bring your own floppies with you you can run cryptographic checksums etc it s a lot easier to verify that the software is unchanged in other words yes i can think of ways to cheat software too i think that they re a lot harder there are three issues with clipper the first is whether or not the architecture of the whole scheme is capable of working my answer with one significant exception is yes i really do think that nsa and nist have designed this scheme about as well as can be assuming that their real objectives are as stated to permit wiretapping under certain carefully controlled circumstances with a minimum risk of abuse the exception is that u exists outside of the chip on a programming diskette that s seriously wrong u and u should be loaded onto the chip separately to those who disagree and i don t claim my answer is obvious though i found my own reasoning sufficiently persuasive that i was forced to rewrite the conclusions section of my technical analysis paper i had originally blasted the scheme i issue this invitation assume that you were charged with implementing such a system with complete regard for civil rights and due process what would you do differently in answering this question please accept nsa s fundamental assumptions that both strong cryptography against outsiders and the ability to wiretap some domestic users is necessary if you feel it necessary to challenge those assumptions do it in the context of the last issue i present below right here i m discussing just the technical aspects and no i don t by any means claim that just because something can be done it should be the second issue is whether or not this whole architecture is actually going to be used just because clipper chips are made this way doesn t mean that that s the only way they ll be made maybe the nsa will substitute its own chips between the programming facility and the shipping dock and they ll generate bogus warrant requests so that the escrow agents don t wonder why they ve never called sorry guys all them terrorists and drug dealers and pedophiles seem to have bought triple des phones instead who d a thunk it i have no answer to this question and at the moment i don t see a way of answering it those concerns are part of my reasoning in my answer to the final question below the third and most serious issue is whether or not clipper is a good idea even if carried out strictly according to the letter of the law i think that the answer is no but it s not a no brainer i m a civil libertarian not a libertarian for reasons that i explained at great length on the net in the elder days and that i don t have the energy to repeat now but that means that i m willing to accept that some laws are necessary so long as they respect the essential rights of individuals the government already has the ability and in our system the right to issue search warrants and while that power has certainly been abused it s also been used quite properly and fairly in other cases is key escrow sufficiently different i think so but again it s not an easy question for me it is easy for libertarians to answer of course since clipper is completely alien to much of the rest of their oft admirable philosophy and it s also easy for those who give their unreserved trust to government a group i m much more distant from steve bellovin
re s s in article r ue access digex net steve b access digex com writes the only theory that makes any sense is that s and s are either the same for all chips or vary among very few possibilities so that anyone trying to break the encryption by brute force need only plow through the possible serial numbers about one billion multiplied by the number of different s s combinations iff the phones transmit their serial nos as part of the message then what is to say that each phone can take that serial number and use it to generate the required key

re clipper considered harmful steve bellovin writes a well thought out and nearly persuasive article about why the clipper are we still calling it clipper today or have they figured out a non infringing word yet protocol is almost as good as one can do given their marching ordes in article apr ulysses att com smb research att com steven bellovin writes i issue this invitation assume that you were charged with implementing such a system with complete regard for civil rights and due process what would you do differently in answering this question please accept nsa s fundamental assumptions that both strong cryptography against outsiders and the ability to wiretap some domestic users is necessary i ll accept the second assumption only for the sake of argument in my view the primary remaining flaw is that the encryption algorithm is secret leading to suspicion that there is a back door without complete disclosure this suspicion cannot be dispelled no matter how many trusted experts are allowed to look at it in isolation is it possible to do this whole thing with a public algorithm the only concern i ve seen with making skipjack public is that someone could build clipperphones without registering the keys assume f can really be kept secret as the government assumes then as part of the initial connection a clipperphone executes a protocol with the pseudophone to demonstrate that they both know f for example the initiating phone picks a number q and sends e q f the receiver sends back e q f and the initiator sends back e q f to demonstrate that her first packet wasn t just a random bit block repeat in the opposite direction with another q so it can t be defeated by somebody building up a library of sequential numbers by remembering responses and using those responses as the initial numbers of subsequent challenges this way clipperphones will talk only to other clipperphones of course the pseudo company can build their own proprietary skipjack phone but the presidential fact sheet implies that they won t get approval for it without equivalent key escrow what s wrong with this picture it depends of f staying secret and on skipjack being resistant to cryptanalysis but the government appears to believe in both of these even if the particular q a i suggest has some flaw i imagine there s a zero knowledge proof protocol that doesn t smb says the third and most serious issue is whether or not clipper is a good idea even if carried out strictly according to the letter of the law agreed my view and you can quote me if it s not worth doing it s not worth doing well jim gillogly hevensday thrimidge s r
how to escrow if escrowing were ok there is a description of something called a fair crypto system in the may issue of byte p attributed to mit professor silvio micali the way it works is as follows you generate your private key s and break it up into pieces s s s s and s such that s s s mod p s you give each piece s s etc to a different escrow agency the agencies each compute g sn mod p and forward the result to the public key telephone book keeper the public key telephone book keeper multiplies all the g sn mod p reduces the result to mod p and this will be the user s public key now if there were several hundered recognized escrow agencies and the user could give a piece of the key to each of the ones he trusted the result would be something of an improvement over the proposed clipper system i still don t think key escrow is a good idea for both philosophical and security reasons but i do offer this suggestion simply to determine whether escrow advocates are at all interested in considering alternatives in good faith or whether the goal is to insure the use of only two agencies selected for spinelessness in the face of official requests

re s s steve b access digex com steve brinich writes second question why why is such a strange procedure used and not a real rng this turns those s s in a kind of bottleneck for system security the only theory that makes any sense is that s and s are either the same for all chips or vary among very few possibilities so that anyone trying to break the encryption by brute force need only plow through the possible serial numbers about one billion multiplied by the number of different s s combinations my interpretation of denning s description is that s and s are chosen randomly by agents of the key escrow companies at the start of each chip programming session i imagine that the chips are in a carrier which will allow them all to be programmed fairly quickly there would not be a need to transfer chips one at a time into a little pla programmer as some people have envisioned my guess as to why this procedure is used is that basing the keys on the s and s using a specified algorithm provides an in principle checkable way to verify that no back doors exist in the choice of the random numbers used to generate the keys since we have to trust the escrow companies anyway it does not weaken the system to have the keys be generated from random seeds entered by the escrow agents and since the algorithm for key generation is public modulo skipjack secrecy then in principle an agent could challenge the procedure ask for s and s to be exposed and run his own independent calculation of u and u to verify that that is what is actually being put onto the floppies and yes there are many ways in which failures to follow this scheme could be hard to check the laptop probably will not really be destroyed each time hidden cameras in the ceiling could see the s and s entered by the trusted escrow agents back doors in the chip could allow u to be recovered heck each chip could be recorded with the same u ignoring what was on the floppy hal finney

that i was surprised to notice however that one question i might have expected to be asked was not are all forms of strong encryption other than the clipper to be made illegal speaking of which is anyone aware of whether that question has been asked of any knowledgeable or official spokesperson for the government i have not yet seen it mentioned in any of a dozen places it might have been reported but i could have easily missed it please let us know if you get a solid answer to the question of legality of other strong cryptosystems so far any references i have seen have been weasel words more plans in the future etc but nothing that could be taken as a no strong crypto will not be outlawed i have heard not verified that the crime bill before congress has language that either requires escrow of keys or that will regard all systems unapproved for public use like strong cryptosystems not trivially broken by the govt or without escrowed keys which one cannot readily change read use being only permitted by folks with special connections or government agencies as either terrorist tools or drug dealers tools not outlawed specifically but by added civil forfeiture powers and clever wording effectively outlawed for all intents and purposes now for some idle speculation for those who don t care hit n now crypto being effectively outlawed could be done without specifically outlawing any class of crypto systems for example a crowbar hammers screwdrivers and such can be regarded as burglar tools pretty much at the whim of the authorities based primarily on the individual possessing them in the car etc not being in a trade that makes routine use of these tools in a like manner one who has no legitimate need gov t definition for strong crypto software or systems and is caught using them might find themselves in possession of terrorist tools in other words if one is not working for a corporation with extremely sensitive commercial data that warrants in the fed s opinion strong security or a government agency and securing only work related data not personal data one will most likely be nailed on this if discoverd a personal desire for privacy most certainly will not be regarded as a legitimate need why do you want such strong security especially from legitimate law enforcement an individual with legitimate endeavors would not be so concerned government is not in the business of revealing your personal secrets to the public so you must be trying to conceal or planning to conceal some unlawful or criminal activity do you have something to hide hmmmm i expect that initially there will be some people selected either at random or who happen to have been troublemakers for the purposes of making an example for those who think the feds are not serious about this mega s one asking about a right to privacy will probably get a response that there is no constitutional right for privacy spelled out as such an argument used in the abortion debate you do not have a right to have security that legitimate law enforcement cannot break as suggested in the clipper press release this in a nutshell is what i find so extremely frightening not only for crypto systems as in this case but for the precident it will set laying the groundwork for future erosions of privacy escrow of both safe deposit box keys master keys or combinations for privately owned safes and so on why not i cannot think of a better way to make an end run around those inconvenient parts of the us constitution a law cannot be easily declared unconstitutional if it there is no specific law it would simply be a minor extension of the rico statutes or wod policies a simple policy decision just like so many of the gun regulations are mainly batf policy decisions the conversation of the fed agents would go something like we are gonna seize your home your computers your car your bank account you don t have to undress and give us yer clothes unless you have a floppy in yer pocket because they are all connected with your acquisition transport and use of terrorist tools and or drug dealers tools part of the wod or against terrorism ya unnerstand no decent american subject would be against these noble causes note we are not accusing you of any wrong doing we are only saying your home computers car bank assets are connected with wrong doing somehow they housed transported and funded these terrorist tools only a civil matter heh heh we had this tip grin therefore the constitutional protection on individual rights do not apply we are arresting the tainted property not you evil grin if you wish to deposit a bond hire some attorneys and go to court to prove the innocence of this property that they are not terrorist tools and again to prove they are not also drug dealers tools go ahead we have no problem with that course with your bank assets seized no car computer or home probably no job too and your less than limitless resources you might run into some minor practical difficulties grin that is what has me going so damned ballistic it is exactly how the logic goes when someone gives a tip that your home has been used to store drugs note no trace of drugs need to be found on the property only some bozo who will say yup i stored stuff in that dude s house probably to get out of a year sentence for dealing much more cost effective to let him walk to bust another day and hit the jackpot with your assets ob disclaimer of course ok note that i am not a lawyer and can only base these speculations on what i have read heard been told regarding past civil forfeiture cases and how they are used to augment the budgets of assorted agencies or to get cooperation of folks who just want to be left alone or who do not wish to be put in a risky situation especially in areas where they are denied either meaningful police protection and the means to be able to even pretend to defend themselves as is quite common back east like nj ma nyc wa dc or out west in ca these people have the choice of cowering under the government boot or cowering under threats of pissed off drug dealing gang bangers helpless in either case all behind some dude who drops a dime on you for his gain or behind the feds wanting to make an example civil forfeiture being the hook point is are these speculations way out of line or are they all too typical and

basic crypto requirements in order to have formulate a rational position on what cryptography policies are acceptable we must set forth a list of basic requirements i would propose the following as a starting point the algorithm must be publicly known and must have a record of surviving attempts by outside experts to find weaknesses the system implementation must make it possible to verify that the advertised algorithm is in fact the one that is being used the key must be quickly changeable by the user and must be of a sufficient length and complexity to defeat any brute force search possible now or in the reasonably near future note that these requirements are not incompatible with some form of key escrow system the may issue of byte describes an example of an encryption system which can clearly be implemented in a manner consistent with the above requirements while requiring that parts of the key be escrowed in order to have one s public key listed by a central distributor

re subliminal channels in dss may i suggest that any any proposed cipher system having less entropy than the user s key and message can have an embedded subliminal channel as big as the difference in entropies between the entropy of the user input message and the entropy of the output for example take plain des the unsuspecting user inputs a string plaintext to be enciphered he cranks the algorithm which has been hacked by george quisling and comes out with j h d nine char in and nine chars out right the unsepecting user ships the ciphertext to be decrpyted and the message plaintext is produced everything fine right nope imagine the algorithm did a lz compression on plaintext before desing compressing is down to four characters with more entropy wj the opponent now pads the message with his own message also compressed dk before applying des to the concatenated compressed pairs when decrpyted the first compressed message is stripped off and declared sent unbeknowst to the receiver the opponents accomplice collects the remaining message in the bit bucket and uncompresses to kill now and to prevent all such subliminal or covert storage channels you would need to have maximal entropy all the time which is a priori impossible because for example a stereotypical message might be replaced by one bit in the output reserving the rest of the output bits for the long covert message in other words if you opponent get to muck with the algorithm you either have got to muck with it last or concede his possible embedding of covert channels in other words if you present a message to an opponet with less than maximal entropy then you have given him free bits of storage grady netcom com ef e ad d d c f fc ac f d f e f

clipper chip reverse engineering i have been looking over the postings about the clipper chip and noticed an interesting omission from the discussion you all mention that the algorithm is classified and have expressed concerns and ideas of how to figure out the algorithm using software the question that i have is why cant someone take one of these chips and reverse engineer it i mean take the thing to a chip testing analysis facility one with a decent electron microscope just pry off the top of the chip and start scanning it with the electron microcope and figure out the circuitry i remembered a place that i use to work for had one of these facilities that they used to analyze chips that we accidently blew out while running tests they could actually find the area that was fried and show us where in the circuit it was i am sure that many companies and universities must have these facilities and that the potential is there especially at a university where the security at such a facility is looser for someone to take a clipper apart and analyze it what can the government do to prevent this start taking away all microchip analysis facilities and electron microscopes mark

from crossbows to cryptography begin pgp signed message please note that the following speech was made by chuck hammill in address all letters to his address given at the end of this document russell from crossbows to cryptography thwarting the state via technology given at the future of freedom conference november you know technology and particularly computer technology has often gotten a bad rap in libertarian cir cles we tend to think of orwell s or terry gilliam s brazil or the proximity detectors keeping east berlin s slave citizens on their own side of the border or the so phisticated bugging devices nixon used to harass those on his enemies list or we recognize that for the price of a ticket on the concorde we can fly at twice the speed of sound but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run by a government policeman and permit him to paw thru our be longings if it beeps but i think that mind set is a mistake before there were cattle prods governments tortured their prisoners with clubs and rubber hoses before there were lasers for eavesdropping governments used binoculars and lip readers though government certainly uses technology to oppress the evil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools in fact technology represents one of the most promis ing avenues available for re capturing our freedoms from those who have stolen them by its very nature it favors the bright who can put it to use over the dull who can not it favors the adaptable who are quick to see the merit of the new over the sluggish who cling to time tested ways and what two better words are there to de scribe government bureaucracy than dull and sluggish one of the clearest classic triumphs of technology over tyranny i see is the invention of the man portable crossbow with it an untrained peasant could now reliably and lethally engage a target out to fifty meters even if that target were a mounted chain mailed knight unlike the longbow which admittedly was more powerful and could get off more shots per unit time the crossbow required no formal training to utilize whereas the longbow required elaborate visual tactile and kinesthetic coordination to achieve any degree of accuracy the wielder of a crossbow could simply put the weapon to his shoulder sight along the arrow itself and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar get moreover since just about the only mounted knights likely to visit your average peasant would be government soldiers and tax collectors the utility of the device was plain with it the common rabble could defend themselves not only against one another but against their governmental masters it was the medieval equivalent of the armor piercing bullet and consequently kings and priests the medieval equivalent of a bureau of alcohol tobacco and crossbows threatened death and excommunication respec tively for its unlawful possession looking at later developments we see how technology like the firearm particularly the repeating rifle and the handgun later followed by the gatling gun and more advanced machine guns radically altered the balance of interpersonal and inter group power not without reason was the colt called the equalizer a frail dance hall hostess with one in her possession was now fully able to protect herself against the brawniest roughneck in any saloon advertise ments for the period also reflect the merchandising of the repeating cartridge rifle by declaring that a man on horseback armed with one of these rifles simply cannot be captured and as long as his captors were relying upon flintlocks or single shot rifles the quote is doubtless a true one updating now to the present the public key cipher with a personal computer to run it represents an equiv alent quantum leap in a defensive weapon not only can such a technique be used to protect sensitive data in one s own possession but it can also permit two strangers to ex change information over an insecure communications channel a wiretapped phone line for example or skywriting for that matter without ever having previously met to exchange cipher keys with a thousand dollar com puter you can create a cipher that a multi megabuck cray x mp can t crack in a year within a few years it should be economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi cations soon after that full color digitized video images technology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete it will have totally demolished government s control over in formation transfer i d like to take just a moment to sketch the mathemat ics which makes this principle possible this algorithm is called the rsa algorithm after rivest shamir and adleman who jointly created it its security derives from the fact that if a very large number is the product of two very large primes then it is extremely difficult to obtain the two prime factors from analysis of their product ex tremely in the sense that if primes p and q have digits apiece then their digit product cannot in gen eral be factored in less than years by the most powerful computer now in existence the public part of the key consists of the prod uct pq of the two large primes p and q and one fac tor call it x of the product xy where xy p q the private part of the key consists of the other factor y each block of the text to be encrypted is first turned into an integer either by using ascii or even a simple a b c z representation this integer is then raised to the power x modulo pq and the resulting integer is then sent as the encrypted message the receiver decrypts by taking this integer to the secret power y modulo pq it can be shown that this process will always yield the original number started with what makes this a groundbreaking development and why it is called public key cryptography is that i can openly publish the product pq and the number x while keeping secret the number y so that anyone can send me an encrypted message namely x a mod pq but only i can recover the original message a by taking what they send raising it to the power y and taking the result mod pq the risky step meeting to exchange cipher keys has been eliminated so people who may not even trust each other enough to want to meet may still reliably ex change encrypted messages each party having selected and disseminated his own pq and his x while maintaining the secrecy of his own y another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a dig ital signature to enable one to authenticate the source of a given message normally if i want to send you a message i raise my plaintext a to your x and take the result mod your pq and send that however if in my message i take the plaintext a and raise it to my secret power y take the result mod my pq then raise that result to your x mod your pq and send this then even after you have normally decrypted the message it will still look like garbage however if you then raise it to my public power x and take the result mod my public pq so you will not only recover the ori ginal plaintext message but you will know that no one but i could have sent it to you since no one else knows my secret y and these are the very concerns by the way that are to day tormenting the soviet union about the whole question of personal computers on the one hand they recognize that american schoolchildren are right now growing up with com puters as commonplace as sliderules used to be more so in fact because there are things computers can do which will interest and instruct and year olds and it is pre cisely these students who one generation hence will be going head to head against their soviet counterparts for the soviets to hold back might be a suicidal as continuing to teach swordsmanship while your adversaries are learning ballistics on the other hand whatever else a personal computer may be it is also an exquisitely efficient copying machine a floppy disk will hold upwards of words of text and can be copied in a couple of minutes if this weren t threatening enough the computer that performs the copy can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but unbreakable remember that in soviet society publicly ac cessible xerox machines are unknown the relatively few copying machines in existence are controlled more inten sively than machine guns are in the united states now the conservative position is that we should not sell these computers to the soviets because they could use them in weapons systems the liberal position is that we should sell them in the interests of mutual trade and cooperation and anyway if we don t make the sale there will certainly be some other nation willing to for my part i m ready to suggest that the libertarian position should be to give them to the soviets for free and if necessary make them take them and if that doesn t work load up an sr blackbird and air drop them over moscow in the middle of the night paid for by private sub scription of course not taxation i confess that this is not a position that has gained much support among members of the conventional left right political spectrum but af ter all in the words of one of illuminatus s characters we are political non euclideans the shortest distance to a particular goal may not look anything like what most people would consider a straight line taking a long enough world view it is arguable that breaking the soviet govern ment monopoly on information transfer could better lead to the enfeeblement and indeed to the ultimate dissolution of the soviet empire than would the production of another dozen missiles aimed at moscow but there s the rub a long enough world view does suggest that the evil the oppressive the coercive and the simply stupid will get what they deserve but what s not immediately clear is how the rest of us can escape being killed enslaved or pauperized in the process when the liberals and other collectivists began to at tack freedom they possessed a reasonably stable healthy functioning economy and almost unlimited time to proceed to hamstring and dismantle it a policy of political gradualism was at least conceivable but now we have patchwork crazy quilt economy held together by baling wire and spit the state not only taxes us to feed the poor while also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and drive up food prices it then simultaneously turns around and sub sidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in crease yields of milk from the cows left alive or witness the fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered as potentially frightening as a comparable increase a few years ago when the price went up we were told the economy risked collapse for for want of energy the price increase was called the moral equivalent of war and the feds swung into action for the first time in american history the speed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be came an issue of federal concern now when the price of oil drops again we risk problems this time because ameri can oil companies and third world basket case nations who sell oil may not be able to ever pay their debts to our grossly over extended banks the suggested panacea is that government should now re raise the oil prices that opec has lowered via a new oil tax since the government is seeking to raise oil prices to about the same extent as opec did what can we call this except the moral equivalent of civil war the government against its own people and classically in international trade can you imag ine any entity in the world except a government going to court claiming that a vendor was selling it goods too cheaply and demanding not only that that naughty vendor be compelled by the court to raise its prices but also that it be punished for the act of lowering them in the first place so while the statists could afford to take a couple of hundred years to trash our economy and our liberties we certainly cannot count on having an equivalent period of stability in which to reclaim them i contend that there exists almost a black hole effect in the evolution of nation states just as in the evolution of stars once free dom contracts beyond a certain minimum extent the state warps the fabric of the political continuum about itself to the degree that subsequent re emergence of freedom becomes all but impossible a good illustration of this can be seen in the area of so called welfare payments when those who sup at the public trough outnumber and thus outvote those whose taxes must replenish the trough then what possible choice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak ing from the few for the unearned benefit of the many go down to the nearest welfare office find just two people on the dole and recognize that between them they form a voting bloc that can forever outvote you on the question of who owns your life and the fruits of your life s labor so essentially those who love liberty need an edge of some sort if we re ultimately going to prevail we obvi ously can t use the altruists other directedness of work slave suffer sacrifice so that next generation of a billion random strangers can live in a better world recognize that however immoral such an appeal might be it is nonetheless an extremely powerful one in today s culture if you can convince people to work energetically for a cause caring only enough for their personal welfare so as to remain alive enough and healthy enough to continue working then you have a truly massive reservoir of energy to draw from equally clearly this is just the sort of ap peal which tautologically cannot be utilized for egoistic or libertarian goals if i were to stand up before you tonight and say something like listen follow me as i enunciate my noble cause contribute your money to support the cause give up your free time to work for the cause strive selflessly to bring it about and then after you and your children are dead maybe your children s children will actu ally live under egoism you d all think i d gone mad and of course you d be right because the point i m trying to make is that libertarianism and or egoism will be spread if when and as individual libertarians and or egoists find it profitable and or enjoyable to do so and probably only then while i certainly do not disparage the concept of poli tical action i don t believe that it is the only nor even necessarily the most cost effective path toward increasing freedom in our time consider that for a fraction of the investment in time money and effort i might expend in try ing to convince the state to abolish wiretapping and all forms of censorship i can teach every libertarian who s in terested how to use cryptography to abolish them unilaterally there is a maxim a proverb generally attributed to the eskimoes which very likely most libertarians have al ready heard and while you likely would not quarrel with the saying you might well feel that you ve heard it often enough already and that it has nothing further to teach us and moreover that maybe you re even tired of hearing it i shall therefore repeat it now if you give a man a fish the saying runs you feed him for a day but if you teach a man how to fish you feed him for a lifetime your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort of a workfare vs welfare context namely that if you genuinely wish to help someone in need you should teach him how to earn his sustenance not simply how to beg for it and of course this is true if only because the next time he is hungry there might not be anybody around willing or even able to give him a fish whereas with the information on how to fish he is completely self sufficient but i submit that this exhausts only the first order content of the quote and if there were nothing further to glean from it i would have wasted your time by citing it again after all it seems to have almost a crypto altruist slant as though to imply that we should structure our ac tivities so as to maximize the benefits to such hungry beggars as we may encounter but consider suppose this eskimo doesn t know how to fish but he does know how to hunt walruses you on the other hand have often gone hungry while traveling thru walrus country because you had no idea how to catch the damn things and they ate most of the fish you could catch and now suppose the two of you decide to exchange information bartering fishing knowledge for hunting knowledge well the first thing to observe is that a transaction of this type categorically and unambiguously refutes the marxist premise that every trade must have a winner and a loser the idea that if one person gains it must necessarily be at the expense of another person who loses clearly under this scenario such is not the case each party has gained some thing he did not have before and neither has been dimin ished in any way when it comes to exchange of information rather than material objects life is no longer a zero sum game this is an extremely powerful notion the law of diminishing returns the first and second laws of thermodynamics all those laws which constrain our possi bilities in other contexts no longer bind us now that s anarchy or consider another possibility suppose this hungry eskimo never learned to fish because the ruler of his nation state had decreed fishing illegal because fish contain dangerous tiny bones and sometimes sharp spines he tells us the state has decreed that their consumption and even their possession are too hazardous to the people s health to be permitted even by knowledgeable willing adults perhaps it is because citizens bodies are thought to be government property and therefore it is the function of the state to punish those who improperly care for govern ment property or perhaps it is because the state gener ously extends to competent adults the benefits it provides to children and to the mentally ill namely a full time all pervasive supervisory conservatorship so that they need not trouble themselves with making choices about behavior thought physically risky or morally naughty but in any case you stare stupefied while your eskimo informant re lates how this law is taken so seriously that a friend of his was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of pos session of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute now you may conclude that a society so grotesquely oppressive as to enforce a law of this type is simply an affront to the dignity of all human beings you may go far ther and decide to commit some portion of your discretion ary recreational time specifically to the task of thwarting this tyrant s goal your rationale may be altruistic in the sense of wanting to liberate the oppressed or egoistic in the sense of proving you can outsmart the oppressor or very likely some combination of these or per haps even other motives but since you have zero desire to become a martyr to your cause you re not about to mount a military campaign or even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade however it is here that technology and in particular in formation technology can multiply your efficacy literally a hundredfold i say literally because for a fraction of the effort and virtually none of the risk attendant to smuggling in a hundred fish you can quite readily produce a hundred xerox copies of fishing instructions if the tar geted government like present day america at least permits open discussion of topics whose implementation is re stricted then that should suffice but if the government attempts to suppress the flow of information as well then you will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write your fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according to your mythical eskimo s public key parameters but as far as increasing real world access to fish you have made genuine nonzero headway which may continue to snowball as others re disseminate the information you have provided and you have not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id eological adversaries or even trying to win over the unde cided recall harry browne s dictum from freedom in an unfree world that the success of any endeavor is in general inversely proportional to the number of people whose persua sion is necessary to its fulfilment if you look at history you cannot deny that it has been dramatically shaped by men with names like washington lincoln nixon marcos duvalier khadaffi and their ilk but it has also been shaped by people with names like edison curie marconi tesla and wozniak and this latter shaping has been at least as per vasive and not nearly so bloody and that s where i m trying to take the libertech project rather than beseeching the state to please not en slave plunder or constrain us i propose a libertarian net work spreading the technologies by which we may seize freedom for ourselves but here we must be a bit careful while it is not at present illegal to encrypt information when government wants to spy on you there is no guarantee of what the fu ture may hold there have been bills introduced for exam ple which would have made it a crime to wear body armor when government wants to shoot you that is if you were to commit certain crimes while wearing a kevlar vest then that fact would constitute a separate federal crime of its own this law to my knowledge has not passed yet but it does indicate how government thinks other technological applications however do indeed pose legal risks we recognize for example that anyone who helped a pre civil war slave escape on the underground railroad was making a clearly illegal use of technology as the sovereign government of the united states of america at that time found the buying and selling of human beings quite as acceptable as the buying and selling of cattle simi larly during prohibition anyone who used his bathtub to ferment yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug alcohol the controlled substance wine was using technol ogy in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agents for his crime unfortunately not to be restored to life when congress reversed itself and re permitted use of this drug so to quote a former president un indicted co conspirator and pardoned felon let me make one thing perfectly clear the libertech project does not advocate participate in or conspire in the violation of any law no matter how oppressive unconstitutional or simply stupid such law may be it does engage in description for educa tional and informational purposes only of technological processes and some of these processes like flying a plane or manufacturing a firearm may well require appropriate li censing to perform legally fortunately no license is needed for the distribution or receipt of information it self so the next time you look at the political scene and despair thinking well if of the nation and of this state and of this city have to turn libertarian

re dorothy denning opposes clipper capstone wiretap chips i believe there is no technical means of ensuring key escrow without the government maintaining a secret of some kind not necessarily for instance in the system outlined in the may issue of byte the process of getting one s public key listed for general use involves giving pieces of your private key to escrow agencies which do calculations on those pieces and forward the result to the publishers of the public key directory which combines these results into your listed public key if you try to give the escrow agencies pieces which don t yield your private key when they are all put together the result is that the public key listed for you is wrong and you can t read messages encrypted to you

re from crossbows to cryptography but i think that mind set is a mistake before there were cattle prods governments tortured their prisoners with clubs and rubber hoses before there were lasers for eavesdropping governments used binoculars and lip readers though government certainly uses technology to oppress the evil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools evil and good walk hand in hand it is also important to note that the good in the tools lies in the wielder of the tools in fact technology represents one of the most promis ing avenues available for re capturing our freedoms from those who have stolen them i cannot accept this ridiculous leap in logic technology is neutral to good or evil when technology is used by evil men it is called evil technology when it is used by good men it is called good technology really it is just technology that allows action to be realized more efficently and on a larger scale by its very nature it favors the bright who can put it to use over the dull who can not try not to confused the development of technology with its use certainly bright people will be better at creating technology but even young children know how to program vcr machines are vcr machines not extremely complex to create it favors the adaptable who are quick to see the merit of the new over the sluggish who cling to time tested ways adaptibility and flexibility is always better at enduring than the stiff and stubborn a young child is soft and supple an old man is stiff and inflexible a dripping of water can cut through stone this has nothing to do with technology rather technology just allows us to magnify action and what two better words are there to de scribe government bureaucracy than dull and sluggish i have no objection to this joshp cmu edu o silent o thunder

one time pad authentication i can think of a couple of ways of guaranteeing authenticity in a one time pad encrytped scheme though i m not sure how to prove that what kind of authenicity they provide an obvious first attempt might be to prepend a truly random unpredictable for eve block to the message and then calculate a crc which included the random starting block and all of the message this could be encrypted after the message the problem is i m not sure it s impossible to come up with a message that will hash to the same crc regardless of the random starting block it intuitively seems like it ought to be hard but i m not that sure clearly a crypto strength hash like md or the sha would be stronger but again i m not sure i m comfortable claiming that it s unbreakable a scheme to use up some of the pad bits to decide how many bits of s to include in the plaintext stream before going on wouldn t be too bad either at the cost of increasing the speed with which you use up your pad this could be used to give you arbitrarily low probability that your opponent could spoof a valid looking message since any deciphered plaintext in a spot that should be carrying s will show that something funny s going on if for each message bit m i we used up one random bit r i to decide whether to insert a into the plaintext stream we d get a total pad use of times the message length we d expand the message size by about half each that should appear in the plaintext stream that doesn t is a guess for our would be spoofer at each bit she has to guess i m trying to see how to quantify her chances of making it all the way through the spoofed message but it gets a little complicated because she can get un synched and still happen to have a in that place in the spoofed message now i can see a simple way of doing this that s got to be as secure as a one time pad at a cost of using times the message length in pad bits for each message bit m i use one random bit r i and xor them together to get x i now encrypt the three bits with the one time pad the enemy has no way of guessing what r i is so he she can t guess what x i is either any change she makes in the ciphertext stream will have to involve a guess of what r i was is there any way to do this without using so many pad bits spoofing the message is equivalent to correctly guessing as many random bits as there are bits in the message clearly this makes spoofing messages just as hard if you know the whole message text as if you know none of it in fact it looks to me like this makes it just as hard to generate a spoofed message with the ciphertext as without it but i m not entirely sure about that is there an easier way of doing this that s provably as secure as the one time pad john kelsey

re pink noise tony wayne writes what is pink noise and how is it used in sound experiments tony pink noise is a random signal with more low frequency components than white noise if you look at the frequency spectrum of white noise at a frequency analyzer you will find that the spectrum power density is flat which means that every frequency is present in the noise signal often pink noise is obtained from white noise by integrating of low pass filtering a white noise signal therefore pink noise contains much more low frequency components the effect of pink noise is sometimes used to simulate thunder or roaring animals an additional low pass filter with variable cutoff frequency will explain you why enjoy it wouter
re x oversampling cd player mcmahan netcom com dave mc mahan writes in a previous article kolstad cae wisc edu joel kolstad writes in article hcbc un l dd netcom com hcb netcom com h c bowman writes i just bought a new portable cd player for the office and i notice that it proudly proclaims times oversampling on the box now while i think i understand what oversampling is the rate of discrete samples exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor i don t understand this times business it seems to me that when i bought my first cd player was it really years ago the specs said times could someone please tell me whether i m getting senile if i m not then what good does it do for the player to take samples at a higher rate the data is only ever read once barring mistracks and such of course and eventually gets turned into khz bit two channel data oversampling takes two discrete data points and interpolates n points between them for n times oversampling when i asked people said that the interpolation was not simply linear interpolation but significantly more complicated you are quite correct in your understanding the filtering is not interpolation as that would distort the frequency content of the signal they do interpolate it s not linear interpolation though you are correct that the frequency content is not altered more specifically the baseband spectrum is preserved and so is every nth image spectrum the other n in n image spectra are removed where n is the oversampling rate you are listening to generally these players run the samples thru an all pass filter network i have done this for ecg waveforms from a person s ideally the filter has a gain of from hz to hz and a gain of from to the new nyquist frequency in practice a finite transition band is required and there is also a certain amount of pass band ripple and stop band leakage with a high order eg taps digital filter a very good approximation can be easily achieved bit deleted about observations of interpolation filter at work in case you care the filtering method uses an fir finite impulse response filter i d guess that cd makers use the same kind of method anybody out there know the real answer i d say that they use a tapped delay line with resistor op amp weighting to accomplish the filtering this strikes me as the most cost effective method for volume production runs no they actually use a digital fir just like yours but built in hardware on custom vlsi chips for mainly economic reasons anyway then the purpose of oversampling is to move the effective sampling rate up to n times khz in order to use higher frequency antialiasing filters for the same quality filter higher oversampling lets you build cheaper filters whereas for the same price filter higher oversamplings lets you build better filters so assuming the quality of all other components in a cd player remained the same oversampling should allow a manufacturer to produce slightly better sound due to anti alias filtering actually i think the only reason they do this is so that they can say that they have a marketting gimic i would guess that it is acutally cheaper to filter an oversampled signal than not you can use sloppier components and give the filter a roll off that isn t so sharp it s too bad that they charge more for something that i think is actually less costly to build i guess that the answer is somewhere between the two as an interesting aside some of you out there may be aware of a scheme used by pioneer and wadia which is called by pioneer at least legato link i haven t heard one of these players but by reading advertising blurb and a couple of pseudo technical articles i deduced that all they do is build a lousy digital oversampling filter and let a load of the first image ie aliassed spectrum through talking to bob stuart of boothroyd stuart aka meridian confirmed my suspicion he said that it sounded awful but then he would wouldn t he christopher christopher hicks paradise is a linear gaussian world cmh uk ac cam eng also reported to taste hot and sweaty

re how to the disks copy protected in article apr csus edu kschang sfsuvax sfsu edu kuo sheng kasey chang writes there are several types of copy protection and the point is to make sure the user is using a legitimate copy the simplest and virtually fool proof way is for the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed on some sort of checksum serial number whatever so a copy put on a different machine not installed from original disks will not work okay so what do you do if some part of the machine presumably the part on which the code number or whatever that the program has fixated itself upon goes bad you replace that part and now your program won t run because it s on a different computer this is of course assuming that the program uses something in rom like the bios serial number maybe and not a disk based code number obviously if the drive goes bad you ll be reinstalling the stuff anyway i work in a computer lab which is part of the university microlab system we have the wonderfully fun task of maintaining well over a hundred machines both pc and macintosh as well as administering a network of over next machines i personally am concerned only with a small lab with ten pc s and ten mac s i m not the manager but help him with admin often imho copy protection schemes of any sort are nothing more than a major headache for the legitimate user anyone who wants a copy of your program and doesn t care about legality will get a copy period pirate board or no pirate board i too have friends who blatantly and quite successfuly hack copy protection schemes practically in their sleep let s consider what goes on in our lab almost daily we have at least one machine down sometimes several due to some goofball screwing up some setting or other on a piece of software admittedly we being students mostly are not the world s most efficient and effective network administrators but we try keeping even the twenty machines that are partly my responsibility even vaguely looking and acting similar to the average user and maintaining behind the scenes consistency is a real headache but not so bad a headache as trying to remember twenty different folder locations of norton utilities when some guy trashes his disk often we have hardware problems at peak business times and have to do some parts swapping to get stuff working temporarily well i ll cut to the chase and quit boring y all the point is often we have to re install software and copy configuration files etc from machine to machine by far the easiest way we have found to do this is to get one machine working exactly the way we want to then copy the complete setup of this machine to the other nine of that machine s type this ensures us that for at least ten minutes we have ten identical machines to work with having them networked simplifies this considerably as our major packages wordperfect windows etc are all network versions and thus only one copy to mess with often however we need to install a package requested by some instructor to one some or all of the machines for a special project this is usually a hand written or shareware etc program similar to what i believe the original poster was asking about the few we have had with copy protection schemes have caused nothing but nightmares for us to maintain in short don t waste your time with a copy protection scheme it s sort of like outlawing guns the criminals will get your program anyway and you will only be hurting the legitimate honest user write a good user s guide and tech manual whatever else for your program please do this regardless of whether you copy protect the thing and only distribute the manual to licensed users jack the price to cut your losses but please take a cue from the major companies who can admittedly afford the costs of illegal copies far better than you and don t burden the legitimate user with a copy protection scheme sorry for the tirade but it s been a long day here mark s underwood ee student university of kentucky lab assistant boyd hall microlab a tiny little division of uk library microlabs e mail msunde mik uky edu the program is definitely backupable if restored to the same machine depends on the programmer don t use a disk drive characteristic if the user did an upgrade to the machine he she should reinstall all programs any way no document look up no disk wear and tear i did not say that the originals would allow only one install the user s conscience should do that i know i ll get flamed for this but with the increasing number of casual users who either unknowingly or don t care about the software copyrights it s the truth i have friends who ask me for copies of my latest games all the time and when i refused they went after somebody else casual pirating is becoming more of a problem some sort of copy protection will discourage the casual copying i ve seen what some of my friends dug up somewhere latest and the greatest games all cracked within days of actual release you know how many bytes you need to change in x wing to disable the quiz two yes two and don t ask me which ones they are determined pirates are unstoppable given enough time but their results do not spread that far since pirate boards are not that well known and easily tracked once found by authorities it is the casual pirates that the copy protection is determined to discourage what i believe the companies should do is implement the above plus a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup registered to xxxxx address city state zip and disables the above two benefits encourages registration cuts down on pirating and makes it more traceable because if the patch s registration message is encrypted it will be quite hard to change and therefore provides a stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands and thus violated their license agreement this way the legitimate users who does not register will experience minimal discomfort who does major upgrades to their computer frequently as only problem they have is they won t be able to restore to another computer the registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and therefore gains full rights and can restore to different machines on the other hand the software company now have a record of where this particular copy is supposed to be if this user s copy was found to be somewhere it was not supposed to be we know who has broken their license agreement of course a hacker can break that eventually but that s not the point is it kasey chang

re lead acid batteries concrete in article apr dmu ac uk cph dmu ac uk chris hand writes carter ames camter astro ocis temple edu wrote why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable when stored on a concrete floor i think it s because the lead gets coated with lead oxide if the battery is not being charged or discharged i remember some advice from an ancient car manual guide my father had which was to use car batteries to power a garage clock or something similar when they re not in a car this is supposed to prevent the oxidation but i ve no idea if it really works the concrete floor connection is a red herring it could be that you stored it somewhere that it could become covered by moisture or damp air which would short out the terminals this may contribute to discharging but would be reversible the same thing happens to my car citroen cv damp gets under the bonnet us hood and shorts the spark plugs to earth so it won t start the solution for the car is to clean the plug leads and spray with wd moisture repellant if damp is the problem then storing the well this is off topic but back in the days when i used to drive bangers i never found wd to do anything that wiping with a dry cloth did nt do i think the effectiveness of wd is a myth invented by the guy who owns the company battery off the ground may help i m not sure if spraying with wd would be safe since it is very flammable high percentage petroleum just a thought chris steve collyer

re suggestions on audio relays in article c qsbf iek ms uky edu billq ms uky edu billy quinn writes i built a little project using the radio shack vdc relays to switch audio i got pretty bad clicks when the thing switched i was doing most of the common things one is supposed to do when using relays and nothing seemed to get rid of the clicks my question is is there a good relay relay circuit that i can use for switching audio so that there will be no noise of any kind on the audio lines i will appreciate any advice or references to advice also exact part numbers company names etc for the relays will help the first step is to make sure that there is no dc component intentional or not on the audio lines to be switched if neither the output or input presents an unintentional dc level let s say they re capacitively coupled then putting a k resistor from each input to ground and from the output to ground is a good precaution against leakage in any coupling caps presenting a dc level that is guaranteed to cause a click if the device presents an unintentional dc level that is from more than just coupling capacitor leakage then you need to remove the dc before switching with coupling capacitors of your own if you have more than one relay each relay switching one input through to a common output you can use make before break switching where for a brief instant both sources are connected during a switch change this may mask the switch click an audio switch that is clickless is made by taking a light bulb and making your own ersatz opto isolator with a light dependent resistor ldr sealed inside a piece of black heatshrink many broadcast consoles use this older but time honored technique claro actually makes a complete optisolator like this but i don t have a part number handy radio shack has a ldr grab bag you might want to try for a simple solid state clickless switch that is cheap you might try looking at the cd analog switch that is commonly available or its older predecessor the again the dc component must be removed prior to switching other alternatives include jfet switches both discrete and ic and diode switching which works relatively well surprisingly all the above with their pitfalls and application tips could easily make a subject for a multi page article solid state switches may induce a click of their own when turned on due to charge being injected into the audio line through device capacitance when the control signal changes state techniques to minimize this include lowering the impedance of the signal paths through the switch differential switching and slowing the risetime of the control pulse with the cutting the click can be as simple as putting k k resistors in series with the control pins hope this helps at least get you started dave medin phone w ssd networking h intergraph corp m s gd internet dtmedin catbyte b ingr com huntsville al uucp uunet ingr b catbyte dtmedin everywhere you look at least around my office the opinions expressed here are mine or those of my machine

re switching ps questions anyways i ve built the basic up down converters with pretty good results efficiency but i m running into problems when i try to design build anything that puts out serious amps i know it can be done i have some v a guts on my bench but something puzzles me i m using a simple choke as the storage element basicly a toroid with a single winding but all commercial models use transformers with many windings i traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for the usual error feedback but some of the others seem to loose me what are they for better than that anyone have a full schematic for one of these that i could get a copy of i d love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such low volume most commercial switchers do not use magnetics for their energy storage that s handled by the big caps on the primary side those which in a linearly regulated power supply would be considered the filter caps coming right after the bridge the transformer is just that a transformer it s there primarily to step the voltage up or down although the inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is not negligible as anyone who s zapped said transistor from either failing to get one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a snubber diode across it would tell you actually many transistors intended for switcher use today have the diode built in the basic switched mode power supply operates something like this in a somewhat simplified manner the ac line is rectified to produce a high voltage more or less unregulated dc rail the energy storage or filter caps appear across this rail as does the switching transistor the transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer resulting in stepped up or stepped down pulses out the secondary which are then rectified and filtered at least one of the transformer s outputs is sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor which acts in a pulse width modulation pwm fashion to control by varying the pulse width the amount of energy being dumped into the primary and therefore the voltage coming out at the secondary the remaining outputs may be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will more or less tracking the regulated output or they may have some additional linear regulation added you may also note that the feedback between the regulated output and the pwm control which is most typically an ic is not done via a direct electrical connection this is due to various safety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be electrically isolated often the feedback path involves an optoisolator to meet this requirement while the transformer isn t the primary energy storage device in these designs this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can be ignored besides the inductive kick giving the switch transistor a bad time as noted above you also need to worry about getting all the energy that went in to the transformer back out again one way or another in some designs this happens more or less automatically but in others you need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesn t saturate which again would have disastrous results best left to the imagination i m not by any stretch of the imagination a power supply designer hopefully a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors in the above bob myers kc ew hewlett packard co opinions expressed here are not systems technology div those of my employer or any other myers fc hp com fort collins colorado sentient life form on this planet

re lead acid batteries concrete in article apr cronkite ocis temple edu camter astro ocis temple edu carter ames writes i was just wondering one thing actually two i hope that this is the proper place to post this subject why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable when stored on a concrete floor i decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle from the unheated garage this year to preserve them and i just went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work but they act like the two terminals are shorted i asked a friend and he said that you should never do that cause it ruins them but he couldn t tell me why it s not the concrete floor that does it the problem is that lead acid cells self discharge over time even high quality cells gates for instance will discharge over a month period of time non sealed cells self discharge even faster if the battery was not completly charged when left sitting it probably discharged past the the point where cell sulfiding occurs which in many cases means a ruined battery datalog consulting tucson az ejm datalog com noao datalog com ejm

re lead acid batteries concrete why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable when stored on a concrete floor when will people learn the trouble is the ballast in the concrete and as every fool knows ballast resistors are used to discharge batteries furthermore it is very silly to store the battery with the terminals downwards as you must have done to contact the ballast seriously self discharge the actual problem as stated by others does vary greatly with certain types and freaks show low self discharge i have in fact seen ordinary automotive batteries which have effectively held full charge for years so it must be possible if your garage is heated store the batteries somewhere cooler but above freezing flat batteries freeze more easily occasionally charge it once a month or even leave it on float charge permanently special charger don t do this unless you know what you are doing seriously dangerous anouther point is the unsuitability of automotive batteries for things like electric mowers they are not generally designed to be repeatedly deep discharged and their life may be greatly shorted some early zero maintenance automotive batteries in fact responded to a full discharge with total failure shortly afterwards but modern ones are superb yrs miles and counting tc e mail tchannon black demon co uk or tchannon cix compulink co uk

lead acid batteries part i thought the first thread was hilarious so here goes another post some more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries one year i left the batteries in the garage the garage is unheated they were left in their places that they needed to be one in the riding lawnmower what a lux and one in each motorcycle the battery in the riding lawnmower was about years old and one of the cycle batteries was new and one was around years old upon spring time i discovered that all of the batteries were dead and needed to be recharged they all worked properly except for the older ones and they had to be replaced about halfway through the summer they had originally been stored in the garage and i think i remember my dad charging them in spring last year i decided to bring them in to the basement which has two parts one is dirt and brick and the other is concrete i brought in all three and discovered in the spring about days ago that not only were the batteries dead but when i put the charger on them the charger said hmmmmmmmm and the amp meter read around in other words it was pinned the internal circut tripped and i went on to the other batteries they were the same realizing that we still had gigantic sailboat batteries also lead acid i decided to put the charger on them these had been sitting for around and a half years on the brick and dirt part and noticed that they only needed a small charge around hours or so on trickle i tested them by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts and they worked fine for around of em this leads me to believe one of several things i bought really tty batteries last year sorta true the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the batteries there was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the room where the concrete is the dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air better than concrete btw i can almost waterski in the dirt room any other ideas could be the aliens anything is possible
re wd as moisture repellant was lead acid batteries concrete in article hpfcso fc hp com myers hpfcso fc hp com bob myers writes it isn t the average temperature that is the key factor here but rather which is better at transferring the heat out of the presumably warmer than ground temperature battery uh bob why is the battery warmer than ground temperature on the time scales in question and with the considerably reduced temperature swings several feet underground there isn t going to be any major temperature difference between the battery and what it s sitting on question why does a concrete floor feel cooler than the surrounding dirt when you place your hand on it because the temperature of your hand unlike that of the battery is determined by the balance between internal heat production and external heat loss you re feeling the greater rate of heat loss from an object your hand which is kept much warmer than its surroundings in the case of an object with no significant internal heat production this will affect how quickly it comes into equilibrium with its surroundings if it started out not in equilibrium with them but won t affect the final temperature for the same reason windchill affects whether you will freeze but not whether water will freeze svr resembles a high speed collision henry spencer u of toronto zoology between svr and sunos dick dunn henry zoo toronto edu utzoo henry

re power signal surges in home brian ucsd edu brian kantor writes while it s possible that it s a ham radio transmitter that you re hearing it isn t likely every bit of signal that doesn t go out the antenna is wasted as far as a ham is concerned and most hams are it is the radiated signal that would cause the problem technically competent to ensure that they don t waste any signal if they can possibly avoid it to get their ham license they had to pass a government exam that tests them on that point among others however you could be hearing a radio transmitter for sure there are lots of other services where the operators aren t required to be technically competent citizens band cb for example there is nothing in the amateur radio tests that requires an technical competence at all it is a simple matter to memorize all the questions and answers however that said most hams that i know do spend quite a bit of time gaining some technical skill listen to the interference if you hear voices clearly it almost certainly isn t ham radio and might well be cb if you can record a don t count on that bit of it you could take the tape over to a local ham operator s house and ask him for his opinion of what you re hearing most communities you cannot do that legally however you can ask a ham over to listen if the interference occurs at a specific time each day then it would be possible to do such scheduling if nothing else you could invite the ham over to transmit from your driveway to see if he interferes if he does then you probably need to have your equipment worked on to make it immune to rf interference have a ham radio interference committee whose members are most willing to help you resolve interference complaints look in the phone book or ask at the local ham radio store or call the fcc for contact info the fcc may or may not have such information they have enough to do without getting calls for such information if nothing else call your city offices or police department general business number they should have the name of a local ham contact if it s a ham he s more than likely willing to help get rid of the problem after all it would be his signal he s wasting if it isn t the interference committee or the fcc may be able to suggest solutions see above your concept of wasted signal is erroneous if his rig is transmitting properly then the chance of interference with the exception of harmonic television interference is the greatest since he is putting out the strongest signal it is unfortunately the case that a transmitting station that is operating perfectly legally could possibly cause intereference to a piece of consumer audio or tv equipment just because the manufacturer of the consumer equipment cut corners on one little section of the device that wouldn t affect one person in a thousand but which bites you often that can be remedied for just a few pennies by a knowledgeable person perhaps even the person operating the transmitter you re hearing unfortunately most consumer equipment is succeptable it is all poorly designed btw hams are allowed amplifiers cb isn t illegal ham amplifier doesn t compute it does but not for a mobile radio there are very few mobile rigs that could power a watt amplifier bill

re lead acid batteries part in article apr cronkite ocis temple edu camter astro ocis temple edu carter ames writes i thought the first thread was hilarious so here goes another post some more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries one year i left the batteries in the garage the garage is unheated they were left in their places that they needed to be one in the riding lawnmower what a lux and one in each motorcycle the battery in the riding lawnmower was about years old and one of the cycle batteries was new and one was around years old upon spring time i discovered that all of the batteries were dead and needed to be recharged they all worked properly except for the older ones and they had to be replaced about halfway through the summer they had originally been stored in the garage and i think i remember my dad charging them in spring last year i decided to bring them in to the basement which has two parts one is dirt and brick and the other is concrete i brought in all three and discovered in the spring about days ago that not only were the batteries dead but when i put the charger on them the charger said hmmmmmmmm and the amp meter read around in other words it was pinned the internal circut tripped and i went on to the other batteries they were the same realizing that we still had gigantic sailboat batteries also lead acid i decided to put the charger on them these had been sitting for around and a half years on the brick and dirt part and noticed that they only needed a small charge around hours or so on trickle i tested them by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts and they worked fine for around of em this leads me to believe one of several things i bought really tty batteries last year sorta true the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the batteries there was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the room where the concrete is the dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air better than concrete btw i can almost waterski in the dirt room any other ideas could be the aliens anything is possible the lead acid secondary cell releases energy electricity with the following chemical reaction pb pbo h so pbso h lead and lead iv oxide and sulfuric acid produce lead sulfate and water the standard heats of formation at c f of the various compounds are heat of formation compound at c kcal mole pb pbo h so pbso h the heat of reaction at c is therefore kcal per mole pbso produced note that lead sulfate is not very soluble grams per grams water at c and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is occurring or the cathode positive terminal of the battery i am almost sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms but i may be wrong oh well i don t have a corroded battery to corrobate and i don t feel like thinking through it right now what is important to notice here is that the reaction as you knew it would be is exothermic or energy discharging if moisture with dissolved electrolytes acid rain condenses on the battery a conductive path between the terminals may form this will discharge the battery as the chemical reaction proceeds the reaction is reversible if electricity from an alternator or battery charger is put back into the battery lead acid batteries must change in chemical composition to discharge each cell has all the reactants necessary for the reaction the non reacting posts terminals of the lead acid battery are there to remove or add electric energy during a discharge or charge because the reaction is exothermic it has a tendency to happen though quite slowly under normal circumstances so while keeping the battery dry is a good idea it is not a total solution to understand why lead acid batteries do indeed discharge faster when stored on concrete as opposed to wood or earth dirt one should recall lechatelier s principle which can be paraphrased as anything subjected to some stress will act to move to a more comfortable position here are the thermal conductivities of a some selected materials thermal conductivity material temperature c f btu hr ft ft f ft diatomaceous earth natural across strata diatomaceous natural parallel to strata diatomaceous earth powder density lb cu ft concrete cinder stone dry pine across grain parallel to grain oak across grain maple across grain note that the thermal conductivity for dirt diatomaceous earth goes down with temperature also c is about k and the values for earth powder are on the same order of magnitude as natural earth the thermal conductivity of concrete is around a factor of greater than that of dirt and is times greater than wood it is these differences in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on concrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood at any instant the discharge reaction is occurring energy is being released either as electricity or heat thermal conductivity of air is about btu hr ft ft f ft during storage except for the trickle that passes through any condensate on the battery this energy is mostly released as heat the higher conductivity surface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivity surface thus if you perfectly insulated a dry battery on all but the bottom surface at any given battery temperature above the storage surface temperature the battery on a concrete surface will be discharging about times faster than that on dirt this is where lechatelier s principle comes into play removing energy from the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion if the reaction normally occurs at room temperature keeping the battery at that temperature requires the removal of any heat produced a concrete surface is a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface store a battery in the corner of a poured concrete basement and you have surfaces removing energy which pulls the reaction along also if water evaporates from the battery that elevates the ratio of sulfuric acid to water this will tend to drive the discharge reaction jeff white jhwhit ulkyvx louisville edu how do i get the ketchup out of my

re laser vs bubblejet there is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printers available from hewlett packard older original deskjet and possibly deskjet units may have a black plastic slide with rubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right side viewed from front of the printer newer printers have a gray or white plastic slide the black plastic slide can allow your cartridge to dry out there was and may still be information packaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation hp placed a coupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new capping mechanism i did this on my printer and did indeed find that the cartidges now last longer i don t have the information handy i suggest contacting your nearest hp service center for information on obtaining the kit hp has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical components that vary depending on the starting level printer and the level to which you wish to upgrade i upgraded my original desket to a dekjet the kit was fairly expensive you are likely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new deskjet now that prices have declined so much upgrading an original deskjet to requires a fair amount of skill but no soldering upgrading a deskjet plus to a is involves swapping the processor card and changing a few minor parts contact your hp service center for further information the pcl language used by deskjets is considerably different from the pcl used by laser printers especially the newer laser printers the biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a raster end command after each scan line this makes no material difference for lasers but causes the deskjet to print the accumulated raster as you might guess the result is hideously slow printing the new dos wordperfect print deskjet drivers are still guilty of this particular behavior from the way wordperfect works this would not be easy to change windows wordperfect works efficiently unless you use the dos drivers instead of windows the pcl dialect used in the laserjet iiip allows compression that permits a full page dpi image to be rendered with only one megabyte of memory an uncompressed image could be as large as about kbytes but the printer needs about k of memory for its internal house keeping laserjet iv models support banded printing that allows incrmental download of the image with compression in limited memory situations deskjet downloadable fonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts a single page from a laserjet only requires about seconds this is faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet printer the presumption of course being that the laser printer has completed its warm up cyle until ink chemistry is changed wicking resulting in image deterioration is unavoidable i won t use the word impossible but matching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely chosing an appropriate paper type helps but does not eliminate the problem laser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable components hp does accept return of spent toner cartridges mitigating the material waste problem to a degree energy waste could use more work warm up times have decreased allowing stand by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the laserjet iv kyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous silicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system the image drum is good for approximately k copies it is a very nice print engine i wish hp used the kyocera engine kyocera also has a neat modular paper source and stacker system the recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower than any of hp s laser printers the pick up pressure rollers are subject to wear and i case confirm eventually do wear out the usual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper the paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a single part from hp service replacement cost for the transport is almost the feed rollers are not separately replacable though it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician i have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer it depends upon the application which printer is best for you if you only print or pages a day and are satisfied with the appearance of output the deskjet is a very good choice as noted the deskjet is my choice for personal use bill mayhew neoucom computer services department rootstown oh usa phone wtm uhura neoucom edu n wed

re why circuit boards are green kuusama kaarne cs tut fi kuusama juha vtt writes not that the question is anything important but i am still curious why is that almost all printed circuit boards are green i have seen a few blue ones but no red yellow company logo etc is there a technical reason or could it be that the marketing geniuses have not tought about it yet the green layer is a solder mask and is used to make a finished board look neat and to avoid solder bridges especially when using wave soldering or any other mechanized approach i ve seen red mask but most that i ve seen are green a bakelite board will look brown in colour and if the solder mask is put on looks like a brown board with green paint on either side or just one side of the board a fibreglass board will look green from the side because the green solder mask makes the board appear that colour if you got a fibreglass board with no mask it would be a whitish grey colour teflon boards do exist as well but i m not sure about that one i d guess the stuff they invented for solder mask was green so they re not about to change also any change in any chemical probably requires a better than normal cleaning of the machines that make boards a lot of companies do not make their own boards they ship them to a real boardhouse

re lead acid batteries part the lead acid secondary cell releases energy electricity with the following chemical reaction pb pbo h so pbso h lead and lead iv oxide and sulfuric acid produce lead sulfate and water heats of formation deleted the heat of reaction at c is therefore kcal per mole pbso produced note that lead sulfate is not very soluble grams per grams water at c and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is occurring or the cathode positive terminal of the battery i am almost sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms but i may be wrong oh well i don t have a corroded battery to corrobate and i don t feel like thinking through it right now the major problem with this is that the reaction takes place in an acid solution pbso is soluble in an acid solution and will not precipitate out also h so is in a water solution as h and so thus the heats of formation of pbso and h so are for the most part irrelevant what is important to notice here is that the reaction as you knew it would be is exothermic or energy discharging as it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic heat producing more about this later what actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this we re talking lead acid batteries of course the battery slowly self discharges as this discharge takes place two things happen the level of pb ions in the acid solution increases i e the lead and lead oxide plates are dissolved the level of h ions in the acid solution decreases i e the solution becomes less acidic or more like water if you like now as the post to which i am responding correctly stated pbso will precipitate in a water non acid solution when the battery dies i e is fully discharged we end up with a high concentration of pb and so in water so pbso forms in the solution and falls to the bottom of the battery of course this happens in varying degrees the more discharged the more precipitate forms the precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery if there is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate more common in a newer battery a dead short results i have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition but they are for the most part useless they can dissolve the pbso but cannot restore the lead and lead oxide plates properly you may have some success with these products for a newer battery stuff deleted to understand why lead acid batteries do indeed discharge faster when stored on concrete as opposed to wood or earth dirt one should recall lechatelier s principle which can be paraphrased as anything subjected to some stress will act to move to a more comfortable position here are the thermal conductivities of a some selected materials stuff deleted this is where lechatelier s principle comes into play removing energy from the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion if the reaction normally occurs at room temperature keeping the battery at that temperature requires the removal of any heat produced a concrete surface is a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface store a battery in the corner of a poured concrete basement and you have surfaces removing energy which pulls the reaction along this stuff is just made up by the author and is completely invalid in fact the discharge reaction takes place at a higher rate at higher temperatures a logical consequence of the above argument is this if you really want your car to start lower the battery temperature to to pull the reaction along we all know from experience at least those of us in canada do it gets cold up here that this is not true if we want to start our car on a really cold day we warm the battery besides which there is not enough energy released through self discharge to appreciably raise the temperature the air would amply dissipate any such heat whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or not this is of course irrelevant since you would want the battery to be cool during storage just keep the battery in a cool dry place and keep it charged

re accelerometer request re specified in article apr walter bellcore com deaddio ski bellcore com michael deaddio writes basically i am looking for something to operate in the ranges of accelerations found in an automobile environment i would like the device to operate as a trigger for other systems when the car s deceleration reaches a threshold value which is how i assume some seat belt lock mechanisms and air bag deployment systems work open up one of the airbag control boxes they have inexpensive piezoelectric accelerometers in them i know that the gm cars use the setra units the cheapest way to get such an accelerometer is to cannibalize an existing automotive unit incidentally these things aren t very linear but for the application they would do a fine job scott
phantoms in my sony strvx receiver while i have gotten years out of this digital receiver it has been acting verry strange of late i hope that the following symptoms may help someone diagnose the error i know that whatever lithium memory backup it had has long died thus if i unplug it it won t remember the presets it has given up listening to the remote i tried changing the remote s batteries when i try a remote function the receiver registers that it received it a green remote light flashes but the right function doesn t happen if any function at all also strange when i hit the mute button for example the display panel goes black yikes i ve never seen that before before all the strangeness started the system turned itself off and on again by itself sometimes it won t play a radio station so i have to kinda twist it yes kinda flex the motherboard chasis for it to get the radio tuning back the aux in function always works however it is inconvenient but not inconvenient enough to pay an expensive repair fee while i m not a hardware guy i wonder if something as simple as a surge supressor will be a quick fix the strange thing is that these symptoms come and go someone told me this unit series has a bad voltage amp chip anyway arghh cjk

re cholistasis sp fat free diet pregnancy heart access digex com g writes hi i ve just returned from a visit with my ob gyn and i have a few concerns that maybe y all can help me with i ve been seeing her every weeks for the past few months i m at week and during the last visits i ve gained to pounds every weeks she said this was unacceptable over any week period as it stands i ve thus far gained pounds also she says that though i m at weeks the baby s size is weeks i think she mentioned inches for the top of the fundus when i was weeks the baby s size was weeks i must also add that i had an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and i ve had no problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain in my pelvic region during the pregnancy and i have a very difficult time moving and the doc has recommended i not walk or move unless i have to i have a little handicapped sticker for when i do need to go out anyway that s of the situation the other is that almost from the beginning of pregnancy i was getting sick throwing up about times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated i told her about this i know this because i wasn t eating very much due to the nausea and could see the results well now i only get sick about once every weeks and it is still bile related but in addition i had begun to feel movement near my upper right abdomen just below the right breast usually when i was lying on my right side it began to get worse though because it started to hurt when i lay on my right side and then it hurt no matter what position i was in next i noticed that when i ate greasy or fatty foods i felt like my entire abdomen had turned to stone and the pain in the area got worse however if i ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to cut the fat it wasn t as much of a problem so the doctor says i have cholistatis and that i should avoid fatty foods this makes sense and because i was already aware of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship i have been avoiding these foods on my own but i m still able to eat foods with ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods but doc wants me to be on a non fat diet this means no meat except fish and chicken w o skin i do this anyway no nuts fried food cheese etc i am allowed skim milk she said i should avoid anything sweet e g bananas also i must only have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day potatoes pasta rice she said i can t even cook vegetables in a little bit of oil and that i should eat vegetables raw or steamed i m concerned because i understand you need to have some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process and if i m not taking in fat is she expecting the baby will take it from my stores and why this restriction on carbohydrates if she s concerned about fat i m not clear how much of her recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on cholistatis which i can t seem to find any information on she originally said that i should only gain pounds during the entire pregnancy since i was about lbs overweight when i started but my sister gained lbs during her pregnancy and she s taken it all off and hasn t had any problems she also asked if any members of my family were obese which none of them are anyway i think she is overly concerned about weight gain and feel like i m being punished by a severe diet she did want to see me again in one week so i think she the diet may be temporary for that one week what i want to know is how reasonable is this non fat diet i would understand if she had said low fat diet since i m trying that anyway even if she said really low fat diet i think she assumes i must be eating a high fat diet but really it is that because of the endometriosis and the operation i m not able to use the energy from the food i do eat any opinions info and experiences will be appreciated i m truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few minutes and i ll end up having to eat constantly thus far i don t find any foods satisfying thanks g for one week she probably wants to see how you react to the diet if it changes anything you can live on the diet but you need to up your calories where before you had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple probably microwave cooked smaller meals but more of them not terrific amounts of meat it s hard to digest anyway for comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal last longer eat pasta or rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn maybe smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area is the baby still coming up is it starting to push or rub under your ribs how tight are your clothes you shouldn t be wearing any clothing that compresses your middle be sure not to suck in your stomach when sitting again it will put pressure on the digestive tract try laying on your sides back and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive easier on your legs circulation as well you might try letting the baby turn or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months when you are shortwaisted it s easy for that baby to end up right under the diaphram especially if you have tight abdominal muscles if i had my second one to do over again i think i d have tried to loosen up since he didn t turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe she just nags all her patients this way especially if she s young but this gallbladder whatever problem that might be coming up is something to be avoided if possible nausea etc can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy my first pregnancy was miserable during the second i had very little trouble some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better chance of carrying their baby grain of salt here good luck jackie

re candida yeast bloom fact or fiction in an article jon noring writes in article rind enterprise bih harvard edu david rind writes do you believe that any quacks exist how about quack diagnoses is true focus of the medical profession the ama and the boards should focus on these quacks instead of devoting unbelievable energy on search and destroy missions to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non traditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients that traditional accepted medicine cannot help if i prescribe itraconazole for a patient s sinusitis neither the ama fda state licensing board nor abfp will be knocking on my door to ask why this is a specious argument on their backs and pee pee on themselves in obedience what do they teach you in medical school how to throw your authority around among other things how to evaluate new theories and treatments let me put it another way to make my point clear quack is a nebulous word lacking in any precision its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand funny i thought it meant one who fraudulently misrepresents his ability and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of disease or the effects to be achieved by the treatment he offers dorland s th certainly more precision than conveyed by chronic yeast the indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency and coming from any medical doctor or wanna be where competency is expected is real scary the inability to discriminate between fraudulent or erroneous representations is far more frightening it is fraud to promote a treatment where the evidence for it is either lacking or against it and the quacksalver knows so or error if the honest practitioner doesn t know so failure to speak out against either bespeaks incompetency p s may i suggest seriously that if the doctors and wanna be doctors on the net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments and theories such as the yeast theory should create your own moderated group may i reply seriously that if the practitioners and proponents of non scientific medicine have left their minds so open that the parts of their brains that do critical evaluation have fallen out they should learn to edit their newsgroup headers to conform to the existing hierarchy and divisions john angelo gnassi lab of computer science jgnassi hstbme mit edu massachusetts general hospital eternal student boston massachusetts usa the earth be spanned connected by a network walt whitman

re quack quack was re candida yeast bloom fact or fiction ken isis cns caltech edu writes i don t know the first thing about yeast infections but i am a scientist no scientist would take your statement no convincing empirical evidence to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome to tell you anything except an absence of data on the question the burden of proof rests upon those who claim the existence of this syndrome to date these claims are unsubstantiated by any available data hopefully as a scientist you would take issue with anyone overstating their conclusions based upon their data beasties with present methods even if they were there noring and the fellow from oklahoma sorry forgot your name have also suggested one set of anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences namely that when people with certain conditions are given anti fungals many of them appear to get better gee i have many interesting and enlightening anecdotes about myself my friends and my family but in the practice of medicine i expect and demand more rigorous rationales for basing therapy than aunt susie s brother in law anecdotal evidence may provide inspiration for a hypothesis but rarely proves anything in a positive sense and unlike mathematics boolean logic rarely applies directly to medical issues and so evidence of exceptions does not usually disprove but rather modifies current concepts of disease so if you have any evidence against the hypothesis for example controlled double blind studies showing that the anti fungals don t do any better than sugar water then let s hear it if you don t then what we have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side and abject disbelief on the other in which case please there is no point in yelling back and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any convincing evidence either positive or negative i would characterize it not as abject disbelief but rather scientific outrage over vastly overstated conclusions it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough manner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double blind study of antifungals or else forget convincing anybody else to carry out the test just carry it out themselves and also whether they can adequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study should be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis i have no problem with such an approach but this is not what is happening in the trenches of this diagnosis bob schmieg

re cholistasis sp fat free diet pregnancy aldridge netcom com jacquelin aldridge writes i decided to come back and amend this so it quotes me and has added comments heart access digex com g writes hi it started to hurt when i lay on my right side and then it hurt no matter what position i was in next i noticed that when i ate greasy or fatty foods i felt like my entire abdomen had turned to stone and the pain in the area got worse however if i ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to cut the fat it wasn t as much of a problem so the doctor says i have cholistatis and that i should avoid fatty foods this makes sense and because i was already aware of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship i have been avoiding these foods on my own but i m still able to eat foods with ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods but doc wants me to be on a non fat diet this means no meat except fish and chicken w o skin i do this anyway no nuts fried food cheese etc i am allowed skim milk she said i should avoid anything sweet e g bananas also i must only have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day potatoes pasta rice she said i can t even cook vegetables in a little bit of oil and that i should eat vegetables raw or steamed i m concerned because i understand you need to have some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process and if g for one week she probably wants to see how you react to the diet if it changes anything you can live on the diet but you need to up your non fat calories where before you had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple probably microwave cooked smaller meals but more of them not terrific amounts of meat it s hard to digest anyway first even fish fowl and breads have fat second the body will make fat out of carbohydrates if it needs them third your body like most peoples wasn t bred to live on a high fat modern diet if you read texts about ancient and primative people you will read about the luxury of eating fat how people enjoyed it this was because it was so rare even cows didn t put out nearly the amount of butterfat in milk that they do now for comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal last longer eat pasta or rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn maybe smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area is the baby still coming up is it starting to push or rub under your ribs how tight are your clothes you shouldn t be wearing any clothing that compresses your middle be sure not to suck in your stomach when sitting again it will put pressure on the digestive tract try laying on your sides back and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive easier on your legs circulation as well you might try letting the baby turn or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months when you are shortwaisted it s easy for that baby to end up right under the diaphram especially if you have tight abdominal muscles if i had my second one to do over again i think i d have tried to loosen up since he didn t turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe she just nags all her patients this way especially if she s young but this gallbladder whatever problem that might be coming up is something to be avoided if possible you don t want to become ill with it while you are pregnant if you are lucky you can work on getting rid of it after the baby it is said that doctors have less gallbadder surgery than the rest of the population a good part of it is that they are willing to do the dieting etc that helps them avoid surgery also i don t think the surgery lets a person go back to eating a high fat diet nausea etc can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy my first pregnancy was miserable during the second i had very little trouble some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better chance of carrying their baby grain of salt here good luck jackie
re is msg sensitivity superstition these are my last words on the subject from lundby rtsg mot com walter f lundby writes as a person who is very sensitive to msg and whose wife and kids are too i want to know why the food industry wants to put msg in food some people think it enhances the flavor i personally don t think it helps the taste it makes me sick so i try to avoid it from dyer spdcc com steve dyer writes sez you such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in any controlled studies infant mice and other models are useful as far as they go but they re not relevant to the matter at hand which is not to say that i favor its use in things like baby food a patently ridiculous use of the additive but we have no reason to believe that msg in the diet effects humans adversely well i know that msg effects me adversely maybe not permanently but at least temporarily enough that i like to try to avoid the stuff from kiran village com kiran wagle writes if you don t like additives then for godsake get off the net and learn to cook from scratch sheesh excuse me why can t people learn to cook from scratch on the net i ve gotten lots of recipes off the net that don t use additives if you like additives then get off the net and go to your local supermarket buy lots of packaged foods and you get off the net is it to cover up the fact that the recipes are not very good or the food is poor quality yes and you buy it says something about your taste eh i don t and what happens when the companies forced to submit to your silly notions go out of business because nobody wants to buy their overpriced bad food removing preservatives directly raises food costs by reducing shelf life hey i ll pay my hard earned dollars to buy food that costs more but does not have preservatives i choose to speak with my pocketbook in many ways from kiran village com kiran wagle you have a good point msg is commonly used in soups in bottled sauces in seasoning mixtures and in the coating on barbecue potato chips nacho cheese doritos breading for many frozen fried foods like fish and chicken etc ad naseum if msg is really the problem we should call this barbecue potato chip syndrome or maybe diner syndrome or the and other natural flavorings syndrome it s been a few years since i ve bought anything labelled with and other natural flavorings from kiran village com kiran wagle the reaction came the time the msg was in the food that was the only difference same restaurant same ingredients how do you know this in order to demonstrate your claim you would have had to supervise the preparation on both occasions perhaps they used msg both times and lied about it perhaps once they used something that had begun to spoil and produced some bizarre toxin that you re allergic to well i had had similar reactions many times that was when i really started watching carefully reaction to doritos hey guess what s in there reaction to lawry s season salt guess what s in there i ll give you a hint i ve had enough problems with many many many different products with msg that i figured out one thing unless i plan on getting sick i won t eat the stuff without my seldane and did i ever learn to read labels please note that i am not saying you are making it up i am just trying to point out that the situation is not always as simple as it might seem which was why i started checking every time i got sick and every time i got sick msg was somehow involved in one of the food products and consider there were no other similar ingredients to my knowledge it might not please a medical researcher but it pleased my own personal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and most importantly it s enough proof for me to avoid it and enough proof that my incredibly frugal fiance didn t flinch when i literally threw out or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg and he always flinches when there s waste but it was a simple explanation i won t eat this stuff i won t cook with this stuff so i can either throw it out or give it away from pattee ucsu colorado edu donna pattee my guess was that the spice mix on the fries contained msg probably lawry s seasoning salt i love the way that tastes i m not saying i never consume anything with msg i ve noticed that i have a certain tolerance level like a small bag of bbq chips once a month or so it not a problem but that same bag of chips will bother me if i also had chicken bouillon yesterday and lunch at one of the chinese restaurants the day before from kelley healthy uwaterloo ca catherine l kelley all that s needed now is that final step a double blind study done on humans there isn t even an ethical question about possible harm as this is a widely used and approved food additive but some say that only of the population has a problem with msg some say it s more like but let s say that it s how many people would have to be tested that would have a problem also i know i have a problem with it and i wouldn t volunteer for a test like thanks guys but i don t want to get sick also i m sure that most people probably have varying degrees of sensitivities at different times if i have a cold i m much more susceptible to the reaction than when i m healthy as proven today when i m stuffy but for some silly reason i still gave in and decided to have the bbq chips from kiran village com kiran wagle because too many of you generic rhetorical you not you cathy go around calling this chinese restaurant syndrome thus suggesting to the people you complain to that you experience this only from chinese food msg is prevalent in a lot more things than chinese food thats why i suggested calling this diner syndrome cathy doesn t i haven t saved all my postings but i never called it chinese restaurant syndrome and i never stated i got it only from chinese food i just thought it would be easiest to conduct my personal test at a chinese take out place that i knew would hold or not hold the msg i can t call up whoever makes doritos and ask them to make me one back of chips without msg on the other hand if one complains about potatoes from a mix or restaurant spice mixes i m going to believe them and if anyone says they got msg sick after eating too many barbecue potato chips at a party i m really going to believe them well i believe i mentioned that in an earlier post let s see you wrote this message at date apr but on date apr gmt i wrote has anyone had an msg reaction from something other than a chinese restaurant lots of times that s why it was so hard for me to pin down i would probably have been easier if i d only have the reaction in a certain type of restaurant but i ve had the reaction in chinese restaurants and greek restaurants and italian restaurants and steak places i can tell you when a steak joint uses accent to tenderize their meat oh and just in case anyone thinks i m prejudice against either chinese food or asian people i m not going home to cook some chinese food for the guy i m marrying next week incidentally his last name is wu so stop it with the flame mail why does a woman work ten years to

annual inguinal hernia repair last year i was totally surprised when my annual physical disclosed an inguinal hernia i couldn t remember doing anything that would have caused it that is i hadn t been lifting more than other people do and in fact probably somewhat less eventually the thing became more painful and i had the repair operation this year i developed a pain on the other side this turned out to be another inguinal hernia so i go back to the hospital monday for another fun operation i don t know of anything i m doing to cause this to happen i m years old and i don t think i m old enough for things to start falling apart like this the surgeon who is doing the operation seems to suspect a congenital weakness but if so why did it suddenly appear when i was and not really as active as i was when i was younger does anyone know how to prevent a hernia other than not lifting anything it s rare that i lift more than my month old or a sack full of groceries and you may have noticed that your typical grocery sack is fairly small these days is there some sort of exercise that will reduce the risk of course my wife thinks it s from sitting for long periods of time at the computer reading news j porter clark jpc avdms msfc nasa gov or jpc gaia msfc nasa gov nasa msfc flight data systems branch

perception of doctors and health care the following article by columnist mike royko is his humorous commentary on some of the public s perception of doctors and their salaries i hope some of you will find it as amusing as i did reprinted w o permission there s no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors salaries by mike royko tribune media services on a stupidity scale a recent poll about doctors earnings is right up there it almost scored a perfect brain dead it was commissioned by some whiny consumers group called families usa the poll tells us that the majority of americans believe that doctors make too much money the pollsters also asked what a fair income would be for physicians those polled said oh about a year would be ok how generous how sporting how stupid why is this poll stupid because it is based on resentment and envy two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign and are still simmering you could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that earns plus and get the same results since the majority of americans don t make those bucks they assume that those who do are stealing it from them maybe the berlin wall came down but don t kid yourself karl marx lives it s also stupid because it didn t ask key questions such as do you know how much education and training it takes to become a physician if those polled said no they didn t know then they should have been disqualified if they gave the wrong answers they should have been dropped what good are their views on how much a doctor should earn if they don t know what it takes to become a doctor or maybe a question should have been phrased this way how much should a person earn if he or she must a get excellent grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in order to b be accepted by a good college and spend four years taking courses heavy in math physics chemistry and other lab work and maintain a average or better and c spend four more years of grinding study in medical school with the third and fourth years in clinical training working to hours a week and d spend another year as a low pay hard work intern and e put in another three to years of post graduate training depending on your specialty and f maybe wind up in debt after medical school and g then work an average of hours a week with many family doctors putting in hours or more until they retire or fall over as you have probably guessed by now i have considerably more respect for doctors than does the law firm of clinton and clinton and all the lawyers and insurance executives they have called together to remake america s health care based on what doctors contribute to society they are far more useful than the power happy ego tripping program spewing social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is to health what clinton s first budget is to frugality but propaganda works and as the stupid poll indicates many americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are the major cause of high medical costs of course doctors are well compensated they should be americans now live longer than ever but who is responsible for our longevity lawyers congress or the guy flipping burgers in a mcdonald s and the doctors prolong our lives despite our having become a nation of self indulgent lard butted tv gaping couch cabbages ah that is not something you heard president clinton or super spouse talk about during the campaign or since but instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a villain they might have been more honest if they had said let us talk about medical care and one of the biggest problems we have that problem is you my fellow american yes you eating too much and eating the wrong foods many of you guzzling too much hooch still puffing away at a pack getting your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to the microwave to the couch doing dope and bringing crack babies into the world filling the big city emergency rooms with gunshot victims engaging in unsafe sex and catching a deadly disease while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure you and your habits not the doctors are the single biggest health problem in this country if anything it is amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do in fact i don t understand how they can stand looking at your blubbery bods all day so as your president i call upon you to stop whining and start living cleanly now i must go get myself a triple cheesy greasy with double fries do as i say not as i do but for those who truly believe that doctors are overpaid there is another solution don t use them that s right you don t feel well then try one of those spine poppers needle twirlers or have rev bubba lay his hands upon your head and declare you fit or there is the do it yourself approach you have chest pains then sit in front of a mirror make a slit here a slit there and pop in a couple of valves you re going to have a kid why throw your money at that overpaid sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger house than you will ever have while paying more in taxes and malpractice insurance than you will ever earn just have the kid the old fashioned way squat and do it and if it survives you can go to the library and find a book on how to give it its shots by the way has anyone ever done a poll on how much pollsters

re opinions on allergy hay fever shots in article apr midway uchicago edu jacquier gsbux uchicago edu eric jacquier says from now on it looks like shots per week for months followed by shot per month or so each shot costs talking about soaring costs and the health care system i would call that a racket we are not talking about rare amazonian grasses here but the garbage which grows behind the doctor s office apart from this issue i was somewhat disappointed to find out that you have to keep getting the shots forever is that right you might look for an allergy doctor in your area who uses sublingual drops instead of shots for treatment you are given a small bottle of antigens drops are placed under the tongue for minutes my allergy to bermuda grass was neutralized this way throughout the treatment process i had to return to the doctor s office every month for re testing and a new bottle of antigens after the allergy was completely neutralized a bottle of maintenance antigens lasts me about months the sublingual drops are then taken times per week and costs so the cost is less than shots and it is more convenient just to take the drops at home bruce long

worldwide aids statistics hicnet medical newsletter page i volume number april centers for disease control and prevention mmwr rates of cesarean delivery united states source mmwr date apr cesarean deliveries have accounted for nearly million of the approximately million annual deliveries in the united states since table the cesarean rate in the united states is the third highest among reporting countries exceeded only by brazil and puerto rico this report presents data on cesarean deliveries from cdc s national hospital discharge survey nhds for and compares these data with previous years data on discharges from short stay nonfederal hospitals have been collected annually since in the nhds conducted by cdc s national center for health statistics for medical and demographic information were abstracted from a sample of inpatients discharged from participating hospitals the cesareans and vaginal births after a prior cesarean vbac presented in this report are based on weighted national estimates from the nhds sample of approximately women discharged after delivery the estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were calculated by applying cesarean rates from the nhds to live births from national vital registration data therefore estimates of the number of cesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based solely on the nhds stated differences in this analysis are significant at the confidence level based on the two tailed t test with a critical value of in there were cesareans per deliveries the same rate as in and similar to rates during table the primary cesarean rate i e number of first cesareans per deliveries to women who had no previous cesareans for also was stable ranging from to in the cesarean rate in the south was significantly p higher than the rates for the west midwest and northeast rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to years than for younger women in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or government hospitals in hospitals with fewer than beds than in larger hospitals and for deliveries for which blue cross blue shield and other private insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of payment table the same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries since the early s the number and percentage of births to older women increased however if the age distribution of mothers in had remained the same as in the overall cesarean rate in would have been essentially the same as the observed based on the nhds of the approximately live births in an hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april estimated were by cesarean delivery of these an estimated births were repeat cesareans and were primary cesareans since approximately primary cesareans have been performed annually in of women who had a previous cesarean delivered vaginally compared with in of all cesareans in were associated with a previous cesarean with dystocia i e failure of labor to progress with breech presentation with fetal distress and with all other specified complications the average hospital stay for all deliveries in was days in comparison the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was days and for a repeat cesarean days nearly twice the duration for vbac deliveries days or for vaginal deliveries that were not vbacs days in the average hospital stay for all deliveries was days for primary cesareans days for repeat cesareans days and for vbac and non vbac vaginal deliveries and days respectively reported by office of vital and health statistics systems national center for health statistics cdc editorial note the cesarean rate in the united states steadily increased from through however the findings in this report indicate that rates have been stable since because there is little evidence that maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of childbirth a national health objective for the year is to reduce the overall cesarean rate to or fewer per deliveries and the primary cesarean rate to or fewer per deliveries objective postpartum complications including urinary tract and wound infections may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries than for vaginal births moreover the prolonged hospital stays for cesarean deliveries substantially increase health care costs for example in the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were and respectively the additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes for physician fees and for hospital charges if the cesarean rate in had been the year objective instead of the number of cesarean births would have decreased by versus resulting in a savings of more than billion in physician fees and hospital charges despite the steady increase in vbac rates since several factors may impede progress toward the year national health objectives for cesarean delivery for example vbac rates substantially reflect the number of women offered trial of labor which has been increasingly encouraged since of women who are offered a trial of labor could deliver vaginally a level already achieved by many hospitals trial of labor was routinely offered in of hospitals surveyed in the most recent year for which hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april national data are available when the vbac rate according to nhds data was the year objective specifies a vbac rate of based on all women who had a prior cesarean regardless of whether a trial of labor was attempted to reach the overall cesarean rate goal however increases in the vbac rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary rate one hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean delivery by requiring a second opinion and by instituting a peer review process other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries

prevention of malaria in africa has become a challenging and complex problem because of increasing drug resistance although the risk of acquiring malaria for u s citizens and their dependents stationed overseas generally has been low this risk varies substantially and unpredictably during may the office of medical services department of state oms dos and cdc were notified of an increased number of malaria cases among official u s personnel stationed in kampala uganda a review of the health records from the embassy health unit ehu in kampala indicated that cases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from march through june compared with two cases during the same period in ehu oms dos and cdc conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and identify potential risk factors for malaria among u s embassy personnel this report summarizes the results of the investigation malaria blood smears from of the reported case patients were available for review by oms dos and cdc a case of malaria was confirmed if the slide was positive for plasmodium sp of the persons were slide confirmed as having malaria a questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the ehu to obtain information about residence activities use of malaria chemoprophylaxis and use of personal protection measures i e using bednets and insect repellents having window and door screens and wearing long sleeves and pants in the evening of the persons eligible for the survey responded risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in kampala although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less than or equal to years than among persons greater than years this difference was not significant relative risk rr confidence interval ci eighty two percent of the cases occurred among persons who had been living in kampala for years compared with those living there less than year travel outside of the kampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for malaria four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who participated in the survey mefloquine chloroquine and proguanil chloroquine alone and proguanil alone in addition persons who responded were not using any malaria chemoprophylaxis the risk for malaria was significantly lower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis rr ci twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported side effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason the risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april all or most of the time than among persons who sometimes or rarely used bednets rr ci the risk for malaria was also lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening compared with those who rarely used repellent rr upper confidence limit risk for malaria was not associated with failure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the evening as a result of this investigation ehu staff reviewed with all personnel the need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens ehu staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection measures and made plans to obtain insecticide impregnated bednets and to provide window and door screens for all personnel reported by u s embassy health unit kampala uganda office of medical svcs dept of state washington d c malaria br div of parasitic diseases national center for infectious diseases cdc editorial note in uganda the increase in malaria among u s personnel was attributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased malaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub saharan africa the findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and continued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in malaria endemic areas preventive measures that are also important for short term travelers to such areas mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in africa and in most other areas with chloroquine resistant p falciparum however in some areas e g thailand resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness in africa the efficacy of mefloquine compared with chloroquine alone in preventing infection with p falciparum is mefloquine is safe and well tolerated when given at mg per week over a year period the risk for serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis e g psychosis and convulsions is low i e episodes per users while the risk for less severe adverse reactions e g dizziness gastrointestinal complaints and sleep disturbances is similar to that for other antimalarial chemoprophylactics doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine but the need for daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense chloroquine resistance e g southeast asia and africa in africa for persons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline chloroquine and proguanil is an alternative although less effective regimen chloroquine should be used for malaria prevention

greenspan and dr deborah greenspan of the department of stomatology school of dentistry university of california san francisco an international steering committee and scientific program committee provided guidance the conference drew more than scientists from countries including asia africa europe central america south america as well as the united states and canada support tor the workshop was provided by the national institute of dental research the national cancer institute the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases the nih office of aids research and the procter and gamble company among the topics discussed were the epidemiology of hiv lesions ethics professional responsibility and public policy occupational issues provision of oral care to the hiv positive population salivary hiv transmission and mucosal immunity opportunistic infections pediatric hiv infection and women s issues recommendations recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association between the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of hiv to establish a universal terminology for hiv associated oral lesions to look for more effective treatments for oral manifestations to expand molecular biology studies to understand the relationship between hiv infection and common oral lesions and to study the effects of hiv therapy on oral lesions epidemiology since the first international workshop on oral manifestations of hiv infection was convened five years ago the epidemiology of hiv infection has hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april radically changed in hiv infection was detected and reported largely in homosexual and bisexual males intravenous drug users and hemophiliacs today more hiv infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in children and adolescents while the predominant impact of hiv infection has been felt in africa a major increase in infection rate is being seen in southeast asia as well five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more are appearing all the time researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions such as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis they also are beginning to explore the relationships between specific oral lesions and hiv disease progression and prognosis social political issues discussion on the social and political implications of hiv infection focused on changing the public s attitude that aids is retribution for indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use speakers also addressed health care delivery for hiv infected patients and the need to educate the public about what aids is and how it is acquired saliva and salivary glands conference speakers described transmission issues and the hiv inhibitory activity of saliva the strength of which varies among the different salivary secretions whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular secretions which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid secretions research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible for salivary inhibitory activity they attributed the hiv inhibitory effect of saliva to the aggregation agglutination of hiv by saliva which may both promote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell and direct effects on the virus or target cells other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease in hiv infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity pediatric issues pediatric aids recently has emerged as an area of intense interest with early and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment the life expectancy of hiv infected children has tripled the prevention of transmission of hiv from mother to child may be possible in many cases particularly if the mother s sero status is known prior to giving birth periodontal and gingival tissue disease hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases and gingivitis found in individuals with hiv infection recommendations made at the workshop include the standardization of terminology refinement of diagnostic markers standardization of study design and proper consideration of confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy occupational and treatment issues occupational issues surrounding the treatment of hiv infected individuals and treatment rendered by hiv infected health care professionals still command considerable attention factors under consideration include the cost benefit of hiv testing patient to health care provider transmission of hiv infection and the reverse and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the treatment of hiv infected patients conference participants

basis to maintain contraceptive protection if a patient decides to become pregnant she discontinues the injections as with any such products fda advises patients to discuss the benefits and risks of depo provera with their doctor or other health care professional before making a decision to use it depo provera s effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive studies by the manufacturer the world health organization and health agencies in other countries u s clinical trials begun in also found depo provera effective as an injectable contraceptive the most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain in addition some patients may experience headache nervousness abdominal pain dizziness weakness or fatigue the drug should not be used in women who have acute liver disease unexplained vaginal bleeding breast cancer or blood clots in the legs lungs or eyes the labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the drug due to

volume number april new rules speed approval of drugs for life threatening illnesses p food and drug administration monica revelle the food and drug administration today announced that it will soon publish new rules to shed the approval of drugs for patients with serious or life threatening illnesses such as aids cancer and alzheimer s disease these final rules will help patients who are suffering the most serious illnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than would otherwise be possible said hhs secretary louis w sullivan m d the effort to accelerate fda review for these drugs has been a long term commitment and indeed a hallmark of this administration these rules establish procedures for the food and drug administration to approve a drug based on surrogate endpoints or markers they apply when the drug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies such endpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in themselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified scientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval earlier than if traditional endpoints such as relief of disease symptoms or prevention of disability and death from the disease are used the new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and effectiveness based on surrogate endpoints can be reasonably established the drug s sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct postmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug s effect on the surrogate endpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness one new drug zalcitabine also called ddc was approved june using a model of this process for treating the human immunodeficiency virus hiv the cause of aids accelerated approval can also be used if necessary when fda determines that a drug judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease can be used safely only under a restricted distribution plan the new rules will help streamline the drug development and review process without sacrificing goad science and rigorous fda oversight said fda commissioner david a kessler m d while drug approval will be accomplished faster these drugs and biological products must still meet safety and effectiveness standards required by law hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april the new procedures also allow for a streamlined withdrawal process if the postmarketing studies do not verify the drug s clinical benefit if

rescue photoreceptor cells in animal tests baltimore md researchers at the university of california san francisco and regeneron pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq regn have discovered that certain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can prevent the degeneration of light sensing cells in the retina of the eye the degeneration of these cells known as photoreceptors is a major cause of visual impairment this research published to in the december issue of the proceedings of the national academy of science pnas holds promise for people who may lose their sight due to progressive retinal degeneration currently no drug treatment for retinal degeneration exists it is estimated that million americans have severe vision loss due to age related macular degeneration and americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus a hereditary disease that causes blindness in addition each year more than people undergo surgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas the research was funded in part by the rp retinitis pigmentosa foundation fighting blindness regeneron pharmaceuticals and the national eye institute it was conducted by drs matthew m lavail kazuhiko unoki douglas yasurnura michael t matthes and roy h steinberg at ucsf arld dr c eorge yancoooulos regeneron s vice president for discovery regeneron holds an exclusive license for this research from ucsf in the research described in the pnas a light damage model was used to assess the survival promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring substances experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their photoreceptor cells the rods and cones of the retina after light exposure brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf and ciliary neurotrophic factor cntf were particularly effective in this model without causing unwanted side effects other factors such as nerve growth factor ngf and insulin like growth factor igf were not effective in these experiments discussing the research dr jesse m cedarbaum regeneron s director of clinical research said bdnf s ability to rescue neurons in the retina that have been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age related macular degeneration one of the leading causes of vision impairment and for retinal detachment following detachment permanent vision loss may hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april result frorn the death of detached retinal cells it is possible that bdnf could play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached surgically retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the retina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades vision decreases to a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness it is our hope that research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression and preserve useful vision throughout life stated jeanette s felix ph d director of science for the rp foundation fighting blindness in addition to the work described regeneron is developing bdnf in conjunction with aingen inc

dec national institutes of health high fat high calorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronary heart disease in native populations of developing countries that have traditionally consumed diets low in fat these findings according to investigators at the oregon health sciences university in portland have serious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing countries this study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and have higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels it shows also the importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body weight thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing countries and affluent nations as well explains principal investigator dr william e connor head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at oregon health sciences university over the past years dr connor and his team have characterized the food and nutrient intakes of the tara humara indians in mexico while simultaneously documenting various aspects of tarahumara lipid metabolism these native mexicans number approximately and reside in the sierra madre occidental mountains in the state of chihuahua the tarahumaras have coupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing probably as a result coronary heart disease which is so prevalent in western industrialized nations is virtually non existent in their culture loosely translated the name tarahumara means fleet of foot reflecting a tribal passion for betting on kickball races in which participants run distances of miles or more while kicking a machete carved wooden ball the typical tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans tortillas and pinole a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables the tara humaras also eat small amounts of game fish and eggs their food contains approximately percent of total calories as fat of which the majority percent is of vegetable origin dietician martha mcmurry a coinvestigator in the study describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while low in cholesterol and fat the tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of mg dl low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol levels of mg dl and high density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol levels of to mg dl all of those values are in the good low risk range according to the researchers elevated cholesterol and ldl cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april disease hdl cholesterol is considered beneficial in previous studies the tarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease although able to respond to high cholesterol diets with elevations in total and ldl cholesterol clinical research center dietitian mcmurry and coinvestigator maria teresa cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a jesuit mission school building near a community hospital in the small village of sisoguichi food was weighed cooked and fed to the study participants under the investigators direct supervision ensuring that subjects ate only food stipulated by the research protocol fasting blood was drawn twice weekly and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to dr connors laboratory for cholesterol triglyceride and lipoprotein analyses regular measurements included participant body weight height and triceps skin fold thickness thirteen tarahumaras five women and eight men including one adolescent were fed their native diet for week followed by weeks of an affluent diet in this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was percent of total calories this is the prototype of the holiday diet that many americans consume a diet high in fat sugar and cholesterol low in fiber elaborates dr conners such dietary characteristics are reflected in the cholesterol saturation index or csi recently devised research dietitian sonja conner working with dr connor the csi is a single number that incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in the diet csi indicates the diet s potential to elevate the cholesterol level particularly the ldl dr connor explains the tarahumaran diet averages a very low csi of dr connor s affluent diet used in the study ranks a csi of the experimental design of this study reflects the importance of establishing baseline plasma lipid levels typical of the native diet before exposing subjects to the experimental diet the standard curve relating dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off or plateau for consumption of large amounts of fat changes in dietary fat and or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels you must have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put into the experimental diet the framingham study for example did not discriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease because the diet was already high in fat all subjects were already eating on a plateau dr connor says after weeks of consuming the affluent diet the subjects mean plasma cholesterol levels had in creased by percent primarily in the ldl fraction which rose percent hdl cholesterol increased by per cent and ldl to hdl ratios changed therefore very little plasma triglyceride levels increased by percent and subjects averaged an pound gain in weight according to dr connor lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon yielding nearly the same results after days of affluent diet as after days hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april the increase in hdl carries broad dietary implications for industrialized nations we think hdl cholesterol increased because we increased the amount of dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous tarahumara metabolic study in that study we saw no change in hdl levels after raising the dietary cholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption in the present study we increased fat intake to percent of the total calories we reached the conclusion in the tarahumara study that hdl reflects the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary cholesterol hdl must increase to help metabolize the fat and it increased quite a bit in this study dr connor explains low hdl in the tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of fat or cholesterol hdl remains an important predictor to americans because of their usual high fat intake dr connor recommends a diet for americans that contains less than percent of total calories as fat less than mg of cholesterol and a csi around varying in accordance with caloric needs such a diet is low in meat and dairy fat high in fiber dr connor also comments on recent suggestions that americans adopt a mediterranean style diet the original mediterranean diet in its pristine state consisted of a very low intake of fat and very few animal and dairy products we are already eating a lot of meat and dairy products simply to continue that pattern while switching to olive oil is not going to help the situation the world health organization who is focusing much attention on the emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies undergoing technological development dr connor says that coronary heart disease starts with a given society s elite who typically eat a different diet than the average citizen if the pattern of afluence increases the entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease which places a termendous health care burden on a society who would like the developing countries to prevent coronary heart disease so they can concentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public health measures to improve general well being rather than paying for unnecessary expensive medical technology dr connors says the overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move their plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high risk range within a very short time by an affluent excessive diet the present rate of coronary heart disease in the united states is percent less than it was years ago so a lot has been accomplished we are

rather than disadvantages write franklin volvovitz and gale smith of microgenesys in meriden conn moore et al says that gp in a baculovirus expression system does not bind strongly to the cd receptor and that this recombinant gp does not stimulate the same antibodies as the hiv virus does in natural infection but vaccination with recombinant gp in patients infected with hiv broadens hiv specific envelope directed immune responses including crossreactive antibodies to gp epitopes and cd and cd cytotoxic t cell responses volvovitz and smith claim that they never intended their gp molecule to be identical to the native protein antibody responses against native hiv proteins including the types described by moore et al exist in nearly all aids patients but do not prevent hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april progression of hiv disease in addition the binding of gp or gp antibody complexes to cd has been shown to interfere with antigen specific activation of cd cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro which may contribute to the pathogenesis of hiv infection the absence of cd binding by the microgenesys gp vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added safety feature phase i studies have demonstrated stable cd counts stimulation of cytotoxic t cells and the suggestion of restoration of immune function based on these and other clinical results microgenesys

the patients including four who had clear evidence of risk factors for the disease one patient who had only a single evaluation by the dentist denied high risk behavior comparative dna sequence

schechter et al conclude that hiv has a key role in cd depletion and aids based on epidemiological correlations with antibodies against hiv and with self reported recreational drug use among homosexuals from vancouver however their survey neglects to disprove duesberg s drug aids hypothesis because it does not provide controls i e confirmed drug free aids cases and because it does not

information inc bethesda md april absence of hiv transmission from an infected orthopedic surgeon journal of the american medical association vol no p von reyn c fordham the risk of hiv transmission from an hiv positive surgeon to patient is extremely low provided that the surgeon strictly adheres to universal infection control procedures write c fordham von reyn et al of the dartmouth hitchcock medical center in lebanon n h the researchers contacted former patients on whom an hiv positive orthopedic surgeon performed invasive procedures between january and june the orthopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after testing positive for hiv a total of former patients underwent hiv testing representing percent of patients on whom the orthopedic surgeon performed invasive procedures during the year period patients were tested from each year and from each category of invasive procedure all patients were found to be negative for hiv by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay two former patients reported known hiv infection prior to surgery the examination of aids case registries and vital records neglected to detect cases of hiv infection among former surgical patients the estimated cost of the initial patient notification and testing was with the single most expensive activity being counseling and testing this accounted for percent of the total expense the patient notification and testing were conducted while maintaining the confidentiality of the orthopedic surgeon who was an active participant in the planning and execution of the study notifying patients of the infected surgeon s hiv status is both disruptive and expensive and is not routinely recommended the researchers conclude investigation of potential hiv transmission to the patients of an hiv infected surgeon journal of the american medical association vol hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april no p smith rogers audrey et al the risk of hiv transmission during surgery is so remote that it will be quantified only by gathering data from multiple methodologically similar investigations writes audrey smith rogers et al of the johns hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore md the researchers identified a total of persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical procedures between and and for whom the hiv positive surgeon was listed as the operating surgeon the aids case registries were reviewed for all patients having undergone invasive procedures and death certificates were obtained among the patients were dead had no address had test results known and did not respond to the questionnaire no study patient name was found in reported aids case registries one newly detected hiv positive patient was determined to have been most probably infected in during a transfusion there was no hiv transmission in person hours of surgical exposure suggesting that hiv transmission to patients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per person hours of surgical exposure the researchers determined there is no evidence to suggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard infection control guidelines over percent of the patients with invasive procedures chose to be tested and of those whose results were revealed only one person was found to be infected with hiv the study patient s infection was probably the result of a tainted blood transfusion received in as a result there is no evidence that the transmission of hiv from the hiv positive surgeon to any patient transpired the researchers conclude april drug concerns to share aids data new york times p c kolata gina a total of major pharmaceutical companies have decided in a highly unusual move to share aids drugs and information while the drugs are undergoing early clinical testing dr edward scolnick president of the merck research laboratory in rahway n j arranged the collaboration he said that cooperation between companies seemed increasingly significant as it had become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more effective in fighting hiv than any drug used alone the researchers are hopeful that hiv when faced with a combination of several drugs requiring mutation at different sites for resistance to develop will be unable to evolve all the mutations at the same time therefore several drugs taken together or one after the other could halt the spread of hiv currently the drug companies do not know what other drugs their competitors are developing the new agreement allows companies to routinely exchange animal data and safety data on new aids drugs an agreement like this will greatly facilitate hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april companies ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a much more efficient way said scolnick he also said that the collaboration would not violate antitrust laws in creating the agreement merck spoke frequently to members of aids advocacy groups including act up dr daniel hoth director of the division on aids at the national institute of allergy and infectious disease said we re delighted to see the pharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that increasing the information flow will likely accelerate the discovery of better compounds for aids related stories wall street journal p b philadelphia inquirer p a usa today p b the next step in aids treatment nature vol no p maddox john although azt was found to be ineffective in prolonging the lives of people infected with hiv the findings do not indicate that azt should not be administered in people with full blown aids writes columnist john maddox azt has been used in the united states in asymptomatic hiv positive people on the basis that administration of the drug appeared to abate the decline of t cell counts however a report in the lancet demonstrated that azt should not be used early in the course of disease while the cd counts of the people given azt were consistently greater than those of patients receiving only placebo the first three years of follow up have shown that the proportions of people in the two groups progressing to overt aids or even to death were not significantly different at roughly percent the conclusions are that azt is not an effective aids drug in hiv infected individuals and that cd cell count may not be a reliable proxy for the progression to aids in infected people but nothing is implied by the study of the utility of azt in the treatment of those in whom symptoms have already appeared there is no case for abandoning that treatment at least on the evidence now available it is much more alarming that the cd count has proven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in hiv infection aids researchers should acknowledge hiv is alive from the beginning of infection and turn it into a workable assay of the progress of disease the general application of such an assay will probably in itself provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of aids concludes maddox infective and anti infective properties of breastmilk from hiv infected women lancet vol no p van de perre philippe et al a vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of the igm type in the mother s body fluids could be valuable to prevent transmission of hiv from mother to child write philippe van de perre et al of the hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april national aids control program in kigali rwanda the researchers hypothesized that transmission of hiv through breastmilk could be favored by the presence of infected cells by deficiency of anti infective substances in breastmilk or both factors a total of hiv infected women were enrolled at delivery in kigali rwanda milk samples were collected days months and months post partum hiv igg secretory iga and igm were assayed by western blot for the latter two after removal of igg with protein g in the day and month samples the researchers sought viral genome in milk cells by double polymerase chain reaction with three sets of primers gag pol and env at days months and months post partum hiv specific igg was detected in percent percent and percent of breastmilk samples iga in percent percent and percent and igm in percent percent and percent in children who survived longer than months the risk of infection was associated with lack of persistence of igm and iga in their mothers milk the presence of hiv infected cells in the milk days post partum was strongly predictive of hiv infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis the combination of hiv infected cells in breastmilk and a defective igm response was the strongest predictor of infection igm and iga anti hiv in breastmilk may protect against postnatal transmission of hiv the researchers conclude april firms to share aids research in global venture journal of commerce p a a total of fifteen u s and european pharmaceutical companies announced tuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early stage aids research to hasten the search for combination therapies to fight hiv infection and aids the companies said the unusual move resulted primarily from the increasing concentration of aids research on combination therapies since realizing that hiv is likely to develop resistance to every individual aids drug edward scolnick president of merck co research laboratories led the collaborative effort that took a year of negotiations to come together said participants in addition to merck the other companies involved in the inter company collaboration for aids drug development are bristol myers squibb co burroughs wellcome glaxo inc hoffman la roche eli lilly co pfizer inc smithkline beecham ab astra du pont merck syntex inc boehringer ingelheim miles inc and sigma tau the participants said that all companies involved in aids drug development they were aware of had joined the collaboration and that any company actively involved in hiv anti viral development may participate scolnick said the collaborators would most likely meet every couple of months for a daylong scientific meeting where they will review for one another their preclinical hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april and early clinical data the american foundation for aids research amfar was pleased with the news of the collaboration which it hopes will lead to the development of drug combinations that will reduce viral resistance related story financial times p guidance over hiv infected health care workers lancet vol no p horton richard the united kingdom s department of health recently followed the advice of aids experts that there is no scientific reason for routine hiv testing among health care workers following recent highly publicized reports of health professionals who contracted hiv the department issued revised guidelines on the management of such cases dr kenneth calman chief medical officer said doctors dentists nurses and other health care workers have an ethical duty to seek advice if they have been exposed to hiv infection including if appropriate diagnostic hiv testing he

re localized fat reduction due to exercise question in apr mnemosyne cs du edu hchung nyx cs du edu writes i was just wondering if exercises specific to particular regions of the body such as thighs will basically only tone the thighs or if fat from other parts of the body such as breasts would be affected just as much there are two different mechanisms here toning of muscles and reduction of fat exercises specific to particular muscles will tone only those muscles exercised example look at differences in arm circumferences between pitching arms and non pitching arms in major league pitchers however if exercise also leads to reduction of body fat the loss of body fat will be equally distributed over the entire body there is no way to spot reduce body fat other than surgically through liposuction distribution of body fat is genetically determined sometimes a very flabby muscle will look like fat so when that muscle gains some muscle tone it may appear as though the fat is changing into muscle but really fat and muscle tissues are totally separate and one does not ever change into the other ruth ginzberg rginzberg eagle wesleyan edu philosophy department wesleyan university usa

re ocd this is to followup my previous reply on this topic which it has been pointed out to me might have been dangerously misleading in two spots i stated that psychotherapy meaning talking therapy and so on was used to treat obsessive compulsive disorder which though sometimes true is misleading it is not often found effective particularly by itself primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug therapy the most current theories of this condition attribute it to more to biological causes than psychological in places where this distinction becomes important i mentioned that the dsm iiir mentions impulses as a possible diagnostic marker however this might look like something people associate with psychotic conditions uncontrollable or unpredictable behaviors which is not the case with ocd one of the diagnostic criteria of ocd is that the individual can and does suppress some of their impulses although they are an unending source of anxiety the obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with ocd are most frequently very mundane and predictable closer to a superstitious nature than a dangerous nature for the most part some references one non technical and several technical that someone was kind enough to supply for me but was unable to post themself the boy who couldn t stop washing by judith rapaport technical refs pharmacotherapy of o c disorder donna m jermain and lynn crismon pharmacotherapy epidemiology of ocd seteven a rasmussen and jane eisen j clin psychiatry suppl the waking nightmare an overview of ocd judith l rapoport j clin psychiatry suppl absence of placebo response in ocd matig r mavissakalian bruce jones stephen olson j nerv ment disease vol no and thanks very much to those who supplied constructive criticism to my first post on ocd i hope this helps clarify the parts that were misleading kind regards todd todd i stark stark dwovax enet dec com digital equipment corporation philadelphia pa usa a word is the skin of a living thought olliver wendell holmes jr

resound hearing aid theory as i understand it the following is based on copies i was given of some articles published in hearing instruments i would appreciate any comments about this and other new technology for hearing aids the resound system was developed on the basis of some research at at t and appears to take a different approach from other aids it appears to me that a new programmable aid like the widex just uses a more flexible and programmable version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of the spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help out in noisy situations the major difference in the resound approach is that it divides the spectrum into low and high frequencies splitting point is programmable apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in the low frequencies while the important consonant information unfortunately for me is in the high frequencies the two bands then are treated with different compression schemes which are programable they have also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call abnormal growth of loudness this latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience though i think the phrase is missleading what appears to be the case is that as you exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss the deficit becomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach the too loud point the sensitivity curves appear to converge this means that if you just boost all sound levels you are overloading at the high end for people with hearing losses hence what you want is progressively less amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point you want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially differently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum specially for someone like me who is relatively normal up to cps and then falls off a cliff aids with simple compressors don t descriminate between energy in the low and high frequencies and can therefor compress useful high frequency information because of high volume of low frequency components particularly impressive was the resound performance with whispered speech and in simulated restaurant noise situations rich haller rhaller ns uoregon edu university of oregon eugene or usa
re candida yeast bloom fact or fiction banschbach vms ocom okstate edu writes to candida blooms following the use of broad spectrum antibiotics gorden rubenfeld through e mail has assured me that most physicians recognize the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad spectrum antibiotic use and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with good bacteria to restore competetion for candida in the body i do not believe that this is yet a standard part of medical practice nor is it mine what i tried to explain to marty was that it is clearly understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections marty made this sound like a secret known only to veternarians and biochemists anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns this at some centers pre op liver transplant patients receive bowel decontamination directed at retaining good anaerobic flora in an attempt to prevent fungal colonization in this soon to be high risk group i also use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea that may be in part due to alterations in gut flora however it is not part of my routine practice to reinnoculate patients with good bacteria after antibiotics i have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating fungal infections in at risk patients whether or not it is a logical extension from the available observations i ll leave to those of you who base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of clinical trials one place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly recalcitrant cases of c difficile colitis not a fungal infection there are case reports of using stool ie someone elses enemas to repopulate the patients flora don t try this at home not give give her advise to use the otc anti fungal creams since candida colonizes primarily in the ano rectal area gi symptoms should be more common than vaginal problems after broad spectrum antibiotic use except that it isn t at least symptomatically apparent disease medicine has not and probalby never will be practiced this way there has always been the use of conventional wisdom a very good example is kidney stones conventional wisdom because clinical trails have not been done to come up with an effective prevention was that restricitng the intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to breakdown the stone once it formed through the recent new england j of medicine article we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is restricting calcium intake seems like this is an excellent argument for ignoring anecdotal conventional wisdom a euphemism for no data and doing a good clinical trial like au dismukes w e wade j s lee j y dockery b k hain j d ti a randomized double blind trial of nystatin therapy for the candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome see comments so n engl j med dec p psychological tests results the three active treatment regimens and the all placebo regimen significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms p less than but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms significantly more than placebo conclusions in women with presumed candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome nystatin does not reduce systemic or psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo consequently the empirical recommendation of long term nystatin therapy for such women appears to be unwarranted does this trial address every issue raised here no jon noring was not surprised at this negative trial since they didn t use sporanox despite crook s recommendation for nystatin maybe they didn t avoid those carbohydrates the conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to be reinnoculated with good bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy if it makes sense for livestock why doesn t it make sense for humans david we are not talking about a dangerous treatment unless you consider yogurt dangerous if this were a standard part of medical practice as gordon r says it is then the incidence of gi distress and vaginal yeast infections should decline marty you ve also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic hypersensitivity symptoms noring syndrome to the yoghurt and vitamin therapy of undocumented candida enteritis elaine palmer syndrome with systemic symptoms there is significant difference between the cost and risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials are we talking about real candida infections the whole yeast connection hypothesis the

pms can it be prevented by a diet change this question came up in sci med nutrition and i m posting my answer here only medical schools in the u s teach courses on human nutrition we have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do when candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical community i think that the best example of where u s medicine is really missing the mark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is pms so many women and their husbands suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that most physicians in the u s are not taught that pms is primarily caused by diet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening before shooting your flames read the entire article and then decide if flaming is justified from a poster in sci medi nutrition in a psychological anthropology course i am taking we got sidetracked onto a short conversation about pms some rumors shared by several of the students included ideas that vitamin levels sugar intake and caffeine intake might affect pms symptoms is there any data on this or is it just so much hooey many thanks michael i ve wanted to reply to this post ever since i saw it but i got side tracked with candida pms is a lot like candida blooms most physicians don t recognize it as a specific disease entity here is everything that you would ever want to know about pms premenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups pmt a anxiety pmt d depression anxiety depression irritability forgetfulness insomnia confusion depression lethargy pmt c craving pmt h hyperhydration craving for sweets weight gain increased appetite breast congestion and tenderness sugar ingestion causes abdominal bloating and tenderness headache edema of the face and extremities palpitations fatigue or fainting pmt a is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low progesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women s cycle pmt c is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple carbohydrates during the luteal phase of a women s cycle there is increased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose challenge the metabolic findings believed to be responsible for pmt c are a low magnesium and a low prostaglandin e this condition of hypoglycemia is not unique to pms but there are a number of different causes of hypoglycemia magnesium and pge seem to be specific to pms hypoglycemia a am j psychiatry unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar magnesium supplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation increased to of the total calories using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources of alpha linoleic acid pmt d is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase of a women s cycle another cause of pmt d has been found to be lead toxicity in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human endometrial cystol fertil steril pmt h is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated serum aldosterone level salt restriction b magnesium and vitamin e for breast tenderness have all been

progesterone administration if you can find a doctor who will treat you for pms just about as hard as finding one that will treat you for candida blooms while progesterone will work supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better there really has been an awful lot of research done on pms much more than candida blooms many of these studies have been what are called experimental controlled studies the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to see done here are a few of these studies carbohydrate experimental controlled study effect of a low fat high carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy lancet pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy of at least years duration were randomly selected to receive specific training to reduce dietary fat to of total calories and increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary advise with no training after months there was a significant reduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in the trained group as reported by self reported symptoms as well as physical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling tenderness and nodularity vitamin a experimental controlled study the use of vitamin a in premenstrual tension acta obstet gynecol scand pts with severe recurring pms received to iu vitamin a daily or a placebo serum retinol levels were monitored and high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of toxicity occured serum retinol above ug ml the intent of the study was to load the liver up with vitamin a and get a normal pool size iu to iu and then see if this normal vitamin a pool could prevent pms getting the high dose vitamin a had complete remission of the symptoms of pms only getting the placebo reported getting complete relief of pms sysmptoms of the vitamin a treated group reported no improvement in pms symptoms experimental controlled study premenstrual tension treated with vitamin a j clinical endocrinology pts received iu of vitamin a daily starting on day of their cycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of pms symptoms after months all pts reported a significant improvement in pms symptoms vitamin a supplementation was stopped once evidence of toxicity was demonstrated and all pts were followed for one year after high dose vitamin a supplementation was stopped pms symptoms did not reoccur in any of these pts for upto one year after the vitamin a supplementation was stopped most americans do not have a normal store of vitamin a in their liver these studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal store of vitamin a into the liver could eliminate pms of all the vitamins given for pms vitamin a b and vitamin e vitamin a has shown the best single effect this is probably because vitamin a is involved in steroid estrogen progesterone metabolism in the liver getting your liver full of vitamin a seems to be one of the best things that you can do to

the menstrual distress questionnaire score of the cluster pain was significantly reduced during the second cycle month for the magnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were switched to magnesium supplementation in addition the total score on the menstrual distress questionnaire was significantly decreased by magnesium supplementation the authors suggest that magnesium supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes that occur during pms there are numerous observational studies that have been published in the medical literature which also suggest that pms is primarily a disorder that arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature but since observational studies are considered by most physicians in sci med to be anecdotal in nature i have not bothered to cite them there are also over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on multivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent pms i ve chosen the best specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out that pms is primarily a nutritional disorder but doctors don t recognize nutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology beri beri pellagra scruvy etc pms is probably the best reason why every doctor being trained in the u s should get a good course on human nutrition pms is really only the tip if the

re candida yeast bloom fact or fiction in article rhb cf hsdndev harvard edu rind enterprise bih harvard edu david rind writes in article apr vms ocom okstate edu banschbach vms ocom okstate edu writes are in a different class the big question seems to be is it reasonable to use them in patients with gi distress or sinus problems that could be due to candida blooms following the use of broad spectrum antibiotics i guess i m still not clear on what the term candida bloom means but certainly it is well known that thrush superficial candidal infections on mucous membranes can occur after antibiotic use this has nothing to do with systemic yeast syndrome the quack diagnosis that has been being discussed found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida women have been known for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and not give give her advise to use the otc anti fungal creams lucky how since a recent article randomized controlled trial of oral yogurt on reducing vaginal candidiasis i ve mentioned to a number of patients with frequent vaginal yeast infections that they could try eating ounces of yogurt daily it turns out most would rather just use anti fungal creams when they get yeast infections yogurt dangerous if this were a standard part of medical practice as gordon r says it is then the incidence of gi distress and vaginal yeast infections should decline again this just isn t what the systemic yeast syndrome is about and has nothing to do with the quack therapies that were being discussed there is some evidence that attempts to reinoculate the gi tract with bacteria after antibiotic therapy don t seem to be very helpful in reducing diarrhea but i don t think anyone would view this as a quack therapy david rind yogurt contains lactobacillus acidophilus and l bulgaricus l acidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily responsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free most of the commercial yogurt sold in the u s has a very low l acidophilus and l bulgaricus count neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are much more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem gordon r has told me through e mail that he gives his patients l acidophilus and several different obligate anaerobes which set up shop in the colon but he hasn t told me which ones yet the lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative anaerobes and will set up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a chance mouth anus sinus cavity and vagina having these good bacteria around will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal region or the vagina i have not proposed a systemic action for candida blooms i know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from the evil yeast blooms in the body i m not ready to buy that yet i do believe that complications at specific sites vagina anal and maybe lower colon sinus and mouth can result from antibiotic use which removes the competing bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked restoring the right bacterial balance is the best way in my opinion to get rid of the problem anti fungals a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin a supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the good bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the ph to basically starve the candida out marty b
re candida yeast bloom fact or fiction in article rhfrkinn shelley u washington edu nodrog hardy u washington edu gordon rubenfeld writes banschbach vms ocom okstate edu writes to candida blooms following the use of broad spectrum antibiotics gorden rubenfeld through e mail has assured me that most physicians recognize the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad spectrum antibiotic use and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with good bacteria to restore competetion for candida in the body i do not believe that this is yet a standard part of medical practice nor is it mine what i tried to explain to marty was that it is clearly understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections marty made this sound like a secret known only to veternarians and biochemists anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns this at some centers pre op liver transplant patients receive bowel decontamination directed at retaining good anaerobic flora in an attempt to prevent fungal colonization in this soon to be high risk group i also use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea that may be in part due to alterations in gut flora however it is not part of my routine practice to reinnoculate patients with good bacteria after antibiotics i have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating fungal infections in at risk patients whether or not it is a logical extension from the available observations i ll leave to those of you who base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of clinical trials one place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly recalcitrant cases of c difficile colitis not a fungal infection there are case reports of using stool ie someone elses enemas to repopulate the patients flora don t try this at home not give give her advise to use the otc anti fungal creams since candida colonizes primarily in the ano rectal area gi symptoms should be more common than vaginal problems after broad spectrum antibiotic use except that it isn t at least symptomatically apparent disease medicine has not and probalby never will be practiced this way there has always been the use of conventional wisdom a very good example is kidney stones conventional wisdom because clinical trails have not been done to come up with an effective prevention was that restricitng the intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to breakdown the stone once it formed through the recent new england j of medicine article we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is restricting calcium intake seems like this is an excellent argument for ignoring anecdotal conventional wisdom a euphemism for no data and doing a good clinical trial like au dismukes w e wade j s lee j y dockery b k hain j d ti a randomized double blind trial of nystatin therapy for the candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome see comments so n engl j med dec p psychological tests results the three active treatment regimens and the all placebo regimen significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms p less than but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms significantly more than placebo conclusions in women with presumed candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome nystatin does not reduce systemic or psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo consequently the empirical recommendation of long term nystatin therapy for such women appears to be unwarranted does this trial address every issue raised here no jon noring was not surprised at this negative trial since they didn t use sporanox despite crook s recommendation for nystatin maybe they didn t avoid those carbohydrates the conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to be reinnoculated with good bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy if it makes sense for livestock why doesn t it make sense for humans david we are not talking about a dangerous treatment unless you consider yogurt dangerous if this were a standard part of medical practice as gordon r says it is then the incidence of gi distress and vaginal yeast infections should decline marty you ve also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic hypersensitivity symptoms noring syndrome to the yoghurt and vitamin therapy of undocumented candida enteritis elaine palmer syndrome with systemic symptoms there is significant difference between the cost and risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials are we talking about real candida infections the whole yeast connection hypothesis the efficacy of routine bacterial repopulation in humans or the ability of anecdotally effective therapies challenged by a negative randomized trial to confirm an etiologic hypothesis post hoc ergo propter hoc we can t seem to focus in on a disease a therapy or a hypothesis under discussion i m lost candida can do that to you gordon i think that the best clinical trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal candida blooms l acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the frequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the candida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and l acidophilus should be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to oxygen just like it does in the vagina as much stuff as there is in the lay press about l acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections i m really amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out the calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all conventional wisdom out the window where would medicine be if conventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials the clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene and a very important one the lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria after antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason to dismiss it out of hand especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply and safely like it is in animal husbandry marty b

efficacy of routine bacterial repopulation in humans or the ability of anecdotally effective therapies challenged by a negative randomized trial to confirm an etiologic hypothesis post hoc ergo propter hoc we can t seem to focus in on a disease a therapy or a hypothesis under discussion i m lost point i m beginning to see that part of the disagreements about the whole yeast issue is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings of words medical doctors have a very specific and specialized jargon necessary for precise communication within their field which i m fully cognizant of since i too speak jargonese when with my peers for the situation in sci med many times the words or phrases used by doctors can have a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the world at large causing significant miscommunication one example word and very relevant to the yeast discussion is the exact meaning of systemic it is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific much more so than its meaning to a non doctor there is also the observation of this newsgroup that both doctors and non doctors come together on essentially equal terms which when combined with the jargon issue can further fan the flames this is probably the first time that practicing doctors get really beat up by non doctors for their views on medicine which they otherwise don t see much of in their practice except for the occasional difficult patient point i understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not prescribe any treatments therapies for their patients unless such treatments have been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well constructed clinical trials usually double blind or that such treatments therapies are part of an approved and funded clinical trial to these doctors to do any differently would in this belief system be unethical practice and it follows that any therapy not on the accepted list is therefore a non therapy it does not even exist nor does the underlying hypothesis or theory have any validity even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation of what is currently known anecdotal evidence has no value either from a treatment point of view and by and large as a scientist myself i am glad that medical practice science takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment however as also being a human being last i checked and having been one of those people that has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment where standard medicine was not able to help me has caused me to sit back and wonder if holding such an extreme and rigid scientific viewpoint is in itself unethical from humanitarian considerations after all the underlying intent of the scientific approach to medicine is to protect the health of the patient by providing the best possible care for the patient so the patient should come first when considering treatment what we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both the scientific and the humanitarian viewpoints in an earlier post i outlined a crazy idea for doing just that the gist of it was to give any physician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe alternate not yet proven therapies maybe supported by anecdotal evidence for patients who all avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted and not until then the patient would be fully informed that such therapies treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that there are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived from them this approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor it also satisfies the humanitarian needs of the patient and the reality is that many patients who have reached a dead end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted medicine will go outside the orthodox medical community either to the doctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing their license or worse to non doctors who have not had the proper medical training this approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control more within orthodox medicine with the benefits that the information gleaned could help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most productive way everybody wins in this admittedly rose colored approach i m sure there are real problems with this approach as well it is presented more as a strawman to stimulate discussion hopefully what i write here may give the sci med doctors a better idea as to why i am open to alternative therapies as well as why i have real difficulty read apparent hostility with the coldness of the pure scientific approach to medicine i believe the best approach to medical treatment is one where both the humanitarian aspects are balanced with and by the scientific aspects anything else is just not good medicine imho just my nf leanings i guess

jml s uva pcmail virginia edu subject resurgence of infectious disease concerns cdc date thursday april atlanta upi a resurgence of infectious diseases blamed on newly emerging viruses and bacteria pose a major challenge for the nation s health care system federal health officials said thursday the centers for disease control and prevention reporting its latest findings in an investigation of contaminated hamburger meat that sickened hundreds in states and killed at least four said it will put renewed emphasis on battling infectious diseases part of that emphasis includes a new series titled emerging infectious diseases to be featured in the cdc s morbidity mortality weekly report which has a wide circulation in the health community the issue also will top the agenda of a two day meeting of scientific counselors to update the cdc s draft plan for dealing with the growing threat of infectious ailments this is an issue that has been coming and we do have a responsibility to deal with it said dr ruth berkelman deputy director of the cdc s national center for infectious diseases there were more cases of malaria in the u s in than in any year since the s and latin america is experiencing a cholera epidemic the first in this century she said resistance of disease causing agents to antibiotics is also a problem we are seeing much more antibiotic resistance than we have in the past berkleman said she said even common ear infections frequently seen in children are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would soon be eliminated as a public health problem infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the united states the cdc said it cited the emergence since the s of a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes such as escherichia coli o h a deadly bacterial infection the hepatitis c virus hiv the virus that causes aids legionnaires disease lyme disease and toxic shock syndrome the incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control such as cholera malaria and tuberculosis have increased in many areas the cdc said it said efforts at control and prevention have been undermined by drug resistance source wall street journal reference pb headline lyme disease ruling raises liability issues the tick that causes lyme disease may have found a new way to cause damage legal liability a federal judge s decision holding a property owner liable for not doing enough to protect workers from lyme disease is getting as much attention as the latest medical study on the disease a flu like illness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in rare instances death the decision last week has put property owners on notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from the ticks they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if someone becomes infected while on the property the decision by u s district judge robert j ward in new york came after a week long trial in a case involving four track workers for the long island railroad judge ward found that the workers contracted the disease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job he ordered the new york state owned commuter line to pay the workers more than to compensate for pain and suffering in addition to medical expenses and lost wages summer camps schools companies with facilities in rural or semirural areas and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the groups that need to be worried about this ruling says stephen l kass an attorney at new york law firm berle kass case who wrote a legal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential liability even a family that invites friends over for a backyard barbecue might be potentially liable lawsuits for insect bites while rare aren t unheard of a summer vacationer in southampton n y last year sued the owner of the home she rented claiming that a tick on the property gave her rocky mountain spotted fever in also on long island a jury ordered an outdoor restaurant to pay more than million to a patron who was stung by a bee causing an allergic reaction and permanent quadriplegia the judge later threw out the award citing no evidence that a beehive was near the restaurant but lawyers say that the attention to lyme disease throughout the country it s most prevalent in new england the middle atlantic states wisconsin minnesota and the northwest may make this particular insect bite a particularly litigious one the illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the courtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will cover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not diagnosing the disease lawyers say worker s compensation claims related to lyme disease have become common in some states in recent years payments in worker s compensation cases however are limited to medical costs and lost earnings the case before judge ward dealt with a potentially much more lucrative avenue for damages because it involved the question of negligence unlike the worker s compensation process the law governing injuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and as a result for additional payments for pain and suffering property owners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many other situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the disease ira m maurer a partner at new york law firm elkind flynn maurer who represented the rail workers says the decision will help to establish the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect against lyme disease lawyers caution that despite judge ward s decision winning a lawsuit for damages caused by lyme disease may prove difficult for one thing victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when and where they got the tick bite judge ward found that the plaintiffs in the railroad case got lyme disease while working on property owned by the railroad even though none of the men remembered being bitten the workers who weren t outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to the insects said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded some work sites a spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that the four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is considering an appeal the railroad also disputes judge ward s finding that it didn t do enough to protect employees the spokeswoman says the railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special pants to protect against bug bites debate in the scientific community over lyme disease could open up some legal defenses for property owners such as questioning whether a victim actually has the disease rather than some other illness earlier this week the journal of the american medical association reported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having lyme disease and damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical disputes over the degree of harm that lyme disease causes because of health and safety concerns some groups and companies already take special measures to protect against lyme disease last year at its headquarters in franklin lakes n j becton dickinson co began using damminix a pesticide made by ecohealth inc of boston that is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease the medical supply company s headquarters include a acre park and the company was worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might get infected ruth lister a spokeswoman for the american camping association in indianapolis says that many youth camps accredited by her organization also have begun to check children for ticks and carole katz a member of the board of the fire island pines property owners association says her group spends each year to treat their acre site off the coast of new york with the tick

re med school admission hoss panix com writes hi all ive applied for the class of at quite a number of schools and have gotten rejects interviews and no responses three possible results after interview rejection outright acceptance outright the infamous wait list if you are on a wait list your entrance into medical school is dependent upon some other applicant withdrawing their acceptance this can happen as late as day of starting classes any one know when the heck these people send out their acceptance letters according to the med school admissions book theyre supposed to send out the number of their class in acceptances by mid march whats going on i am losing my sanity checking my mailbox every day you can always call the admissions office the secretaries should have some idea of when a decision might be made on your application be calm respectful and friendly secretaries have more power than you might realize and you never know could be the dean of admissions answering the phone also does anyone have some useful alternatives in case i dont get in i if you don t get in this year sit down and re evaluate yourself your motives desires and goals that are directing you into medicine your academic and extracurricular accomplishments make a decision about whether you really want to be a medical doctor i had classmates who dropped out in the first semester of med school because they found it was not what they wanted to do i have friends who applied four years in a row before they were accepted medicine as a career is a choice you must make for yourself don t be pushed into it because of your parents family significant other if you still want to be a medical doctor determine how you can improve your application a letter of recommendation from a professor who knows you well and can give an honest positive recommendation is far better than one from a big shot famous professor who only vaguely remembers your face also don t be afraid to ask these people if they can give you an honest and positive recommendation give them a chance to say no sorry instead of the medical school saying no sorry i have turned down writing recommendations for some students because i did not know them well enough to make any meaningful comments and some because i honestly could not recommend them at that point rewrite your personal statement take it by an english professor or some other friendly person with skill and experience in writing and proof reading and get their criticism both about what you are saying as well as how you say it review your academic accomplishments if your grades are poor in some area don t be afraid to spend some time in further coursework evidence of determined committment will help here if you filled your pre medicine curriculum with gut courses it usually shows look at your extracurricular involvements participating in local philanthropic or service organizations is a plus substantial leadership roles in an organization help also beware of resume padding such things are not difficult to spot and weed out overall a clear conception of where you wish to head and why you want to get there combined with an honest self appraisal of skills and aptitude will be the best path to take in applying to any program medical or what have you good luck with the process as tom petty says the waiting is the hardest part at least emotionally bob schmieg

re use of haldol in elderly lawrence curcio lc b andrew cmu edu wrote i ve seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and demented during hospital stays in the examples i ve seen drugs were definitely involved my own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the hospital he was fifty three at the time and he was on separate medications the family protested but the doctors were adamant telling us that none of the drugs interact they even took the attitude that if he was disoriented they should put him on something else as well with the help of an md friend of the family we had all his medication discontinued he had a seizure that night and was put back on one drug two days later he was his old self again i guess there aren t many medical texts that address the subject of way interactions i saw the same thing happen to my father and i can more or less validate your take on hospitals it seems to me that medical science understands precious little about taking care of the human machine drugs are given as a response to symptoms and i guess that makes sense since all the studies that validate the effectiveness of those drugs are based on a narrow assessment of the degree of particular symptoms but there seems to be very little appreciation for the well being of a person outside of the numbers that appear on a test i watched my dad wither away and lose huge amounts of body fat and muscles tissue while in the hospital there is something a little crazy about a system in which there is more attention paid to giving you every latest drug available than there is attention paid to whether you have had enough to eat to prevent loss of muscle tissue it is really really bizarre will estes internet westes netcom com

what is the medical term for this sensation dear netters maybe one of you can explain this from time to time i experience a strange kind of feeling i have all kinds of weird feelings which can be best described as the feeling of losing gravity like that one experiences in a descending elevator needless to say it is not enjoyable it sometimes comes with shortness of breath and extreme fatigue it lasts from a few minutes to an hour and when it lasts that long it makes me sweatening initially i called it palpitation spelling until i later learnt that the terminology has been reserved for the self awareness of heart beats so is there a specific term for this feeling or am i a stragne person i always believe i am unique thanks ping

re med school admission i m a fellow applicant and my situation is not too much better i applied to about schools got two interviews got one offer and am waiting to hear from the other school let me be honest about my experiences and impressions about the medical school admissions process numbers gpa mcats are not everything but they are probably more important than anything else in fact some schools screen out applicants based on these numbers and never even look at your other qualities of course when this happens don t expect a refund on your application fee but the fact that you got four interviews tells me that you have the numbers and are very well qualified academically you mentioned one response was it an acceptance denial or wait list if i assume the worst that it was a denial then you still have a great probability of acceptance somewhere how did your interviews go as for how long you have to wait i ve called a few schools who never contacted me for anything many of them told me that the interview season for them was over and that if i haven t heard by now i can assume a denial many rejection letters are not sent out until may or as late as june but some schools are still interviewing i really don t think you should worry don t become fixated on the mailbox go out have fun be very proud of yourself what do people think of the medical school admissions process i had a very mediocre gpa but high mcat scores and i have been working as a software engineer for two years i majored in computer science at stanford still i think the profile of the person who has the best chance of getting admitted is something like this very important gpa or better mcat top in all subject medium importance writing speaking ability maturity motivation for going into medicine activities less important college or university major work experience anything else you want them to know anyway you are in good shape i think admissions committees are bound in many ways by the numbers but would like very much to understand each person as an individual sometimes thats just not practical but getting four interviews is an indicator that you have the numbers hopefully you were able to impress them with your character good luck jeff

re resound hearing aids and others in article rhaller rhaller cc uoregon edu rhaller ns uoregon edu rich haller writes i have a fairly severe high frequency hearing loss a recent rough test showed a gently sloping loss to db down at cps then it falls off a cliff to dbs down from cps on this type of loss is difficult to fit i am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids which keep me roughly functional but leave a lot to be desired recently i had an opportunity to test the widex q behind the ear aids for several weeks these have four independent programs which are intended to be customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed i found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was about to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of another programmable system called resound unfortunately i was only able to try the resound aids in their office for about minutes and i couldn t compare them head to head with the widex nevertheless it did appear to me that they were superior and i was impressed by what i was able to read about the theory behind them which i will give in a separate posting they also carry the widex aids and had one patient presumably wealthy who decided to go ahead and get the resound even though he had purchased the widex only months ago the problem is that the resound aids are about twice as expensive as the widex and other programmable aids i could take a trip to europe on the difference being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money i am having a hard time persuading myself to go with the resounds i would appreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projections about when and if i might see improvements in technology that aren t quite so expensive your hearing curve sounds a lot like mine thanks uncle sam i ve been wearing miracle ear canal aids for about months now and i find them to be acceptable they are molded to the shape of your ear canal and tuned to your hearing curve they are comfortable to wear and almost invisible if you re worried about that although if you re currently wearing behind the ear models that s not an issue the cost i paid each for mine through the miracle ear counter at sears i ve heard that there is a substantial discount for senior citizens but i haven t researched that because i m not a senior citizen yet give them a try you might be pleasantly surprised alan hepburn a man doesn t know what he knows national semiconductor until he knows what he doesn t know santa clara ca alan berlioz nsc com thomas carlyle

schatzki ring pvc s can anybody out there provide me with any advice concerning the following two health problems first i was recently diagnosed using a ugi series as having a schatzki ring and small sliding hiatal hernia as i understand it the hernia is a relatively minor problem though i do occasionally have some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it the schatzki ring on the other hand is causing swallowing difficulty in particular if i m not careful about eating slowly and thoroughly chewing food food occasionally gets stuck before reaching my stomach this results in a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction fortunately the food has always managed to pass but this is annoying and causes frequent discomfort my doctor wants to dilate the ring using the following procedure use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomach for any inflammation then cut through the ring and dilate it by passing some kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous i would like to know if anyone out there has had this or a similar procedure done if so was it painful successful etc also can anyone comment on safety advisability and success rate of this procedure has it become a common procedure i am kind of leery of having such an invasive sounding procedure performed for a currently non threatening condition such as this especially considering the possible side effects bleeding perforation reaction to anesthesia the second issue for the past years i have had a large number of extra heartbeats in particular during the past month or so there has been a dramatic increase a holter monitor recently showed pvc s in hrs along with a few pac s many days there are far more than this however five to ten per hour all of them were isolated and the cardiologist indicated that such a number was normal it certainly doesn t feel normal in the past there have also been a couple of episodes of extended runs of these beats one of which lasted long enough to cause severe light headedness i am relatively young ish thin and in good health recent bloodtests were all normal and do not smoke use drugs or caffeine etc i m willing to accept the extra beats as normal but don t want to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom the number of pvc s seems to increase throughout the day and with exercise or something as simple as climbing some stairs also if i get up after sitting or lying down for a while i tend to get a couple of extra beats could they possibly be related to the esophagous problems both seemed to develop at about the same time thanks for any help advice

new method for diagnosing alzheimer s disease discovered here is a press release from huntington medical research institutes new method for diagnosing alzheimer s disease discovered at huntington medical research institutes results to be reported to national desk health writer contact john lockhart or belinda gerber or for the huntington medical research institutes los angeles april a new method for diagnosing and measuring chemical imbalances in the brain which lead to alzheimer s disease and other dementias has been discovered by researchers at the huntington medical research institutes hmri in pasadena calif results of their research will be reported in the may issue of the scientific journal radiology using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging mri called magnetic resonance spectroscopy mrs a research team led by brian d ross m d d phil conducted a study on elderly patients who were believed to be suffering from some form of dementia the exams used standard mri equipment fitted with special software developed at hmri called clinical proton mrs clinical proton mrs is easily applied giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses in less than minutes an automated version of clinical proton mrs called proton brain examination probe reduces the examination time yet further providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than minutes by comparison the current standard of care in testing for alzheimer s disease calls for lengthy memory function and neuropsychological tests which can be very upsetting to the patient are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy in addition to alzheimer s disease the new clinical proton mrs exam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias including aids related dementia parkinson s disease and huntington s disease we ve developed a simple test which can be administered quickly and relatively inexpensively using existing mri equipment fitted with either the mrs or probe software said dr ross adding this will help physicians to diagnose alzheimer s earlier and intervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease causes further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain dr ross and his hmri team measured a family of chemicals in the brain known as inositols and myo inositol mi acted as a marker in the study in comparison to healthy patients those diagnosed with alzheimer s showed a percent increase in mi while their level of another chemical called n acetylaspartate naa was significantly lower indicating a loss of brain stimulating neurons believed to be associated with the progression of the disease current drug therapy for alzheimer s disease is widely considered to be inadequate this is attributable dr ross believes to the theory that alzheimer s is caused by an interruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to the nerve cells this belief has been adhered to over the last years and consequently most drugs to treat alzheimer s were based on the changing receptors for acetylcholine physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate alzheimer s from other dementias to provide the patient and his or her family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment protocols for the treatment of this disease for this reason we consider this test a major advancement in medicine said bruce miller m d a noted neurologist at harbor ucla mrs researcher and a co author of the study other members of the hmri research team included rex a moats ph d truda shonk b s thomas ernst ph d and suzanne woolley r n the probe software can be fitted on the approximately general electric mri units currently in use in the united states and will be configured for other manufacturers mri units soon for interviews with dr ross advance copies of the radiology may issue and other information please contact john lockhart or belinda gerber for hmri at or q a on alzheimer s disease what is alzheimer s disease and how is it caused alzheimer s disease ad is an incurable degenerative disease of the brain first described in by the german neuropathologist alois alzheimer as the disease progresses it leads to loss of memory and mental functioning followed by changes in personality loss of control of bodily functions and eventually death how many people does it affect alzheimer s disease affects an estimated million adults in the united states and is the fourth leading cause of death taking approximately lives each year while alzheimer s debilitates its victims it is equally devastating both emotionally and financially for patients families ad is the most common cause of dementia in adults symptoms worsen every year and death usually occurs within years of initial onset what are its signs and symptoms although the cause of ad is not known two risk factors have been identified advanced age and genetic predisposition the risk of developing ad is less than one percent before the age of yars old but increases steeply in each successive decade of life to reach percent by the age of in patients with familial ad immediate family relatives have a percent chance of developing ad one of its first symptoms is severe forgetfulness caused by short term memory loss dr herman weinreb of the school of medicine at new york university says whether forgetfulness is a serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree and suggests the following criteria forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is normal forgetting the name of a loved one is serious forgetting where you left your keys is normal forgetting how to get home is serious doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be evaluated in order to rule out alzheimer s disease and other forms of dementia canada remote systems toronto

re kidney stones in article apr ux cts eiu edu cfaks ux cts eiu edu alice sanders writes a student told me today that she has been diagnosed with kidney stones a cyst on one kidney and a kidney infection she was upset because her condition had been misdiagnosed since last fall and she has been ill all this time during her most recent doctor s appointment at her parents hmo clinic she said that about forty x rays were made of her kidney when she asked why so many x rays were being made she was told by a technician that they need to see the area from different views but she says that about five x rays were made from each angle she couldn t help feeling that something must be wrong with the procedure or something she is a pre med student and feels she could have understood what was happening if someone would have explained when nobody would she got worried also she is told that thre are surgery patients ahead of her and that they cannot do surgery until august or so it is now april she is supposed to rest a lot and drink fluids but she has to go to classes she wonders why they have given her no medicine she plans to call back her doctor s office clinic and try to get answers to these questions but i told her i would also write in to sci med and see what i could find out about why there were so many x rays and whether it seems o k to wait in line or more months for surgery for something like this or whether she should be looking elsewhere for her care she does plan to get a second opinion too i will pass info on to her it never hurts to get information from more than one source you can e mail me or post thanks alice my opinion for what it s worth is that x rays is way too many guidleines have been set on the number of dental x rays and chest x rays that one should have over a given period of time because of all the environmental factors that can cause cancer in humans ionizing radiation is one of the most potent splits dna and causes hydroxyl free radical formation in tissue cells ultasound like that used in seeing the fetus in the uterus has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumors in the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder but kidney tissue may be too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stones any radiologists care to comment most stones will pass but it s a very painful process unlike gallstones i don t think that there are many drugs that can help dissolve the kidney stone which is probably calcium oxalate vitamin c and magnesium have worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the aterial wall i have no idea if a diet change or supplementation could speed up the process of kidney stone passage but i m pretty confident that a diet change and or supplementation can prevent a reoccurance if surgery is being contemplated the stone must be in the kidney tubule a second opinion is a good idea because there are better less damaging ways to break up the stone if it s logged within the kidney sonic blasts hmo s are notorious for conservative care and long waits for expensvie treatments my condolences to your friend marty b

your situation both my wife and i suffered from bouts of depression her s was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a rebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and chemotherapy lida i used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through her six months of chemotherapy with the approval of her oncologist when severe depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped i tried to use supplements to bring her out of it i had cured her pms using supplements and i really thought that i knew enough about the role of diet in depression to take care of her depression as well it

depression can have a dietary component but the problem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use an approach which will fix the problem for chemotherapy i knew exactly what drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be affected same thing for pms i was flying blind for both of these stressors but the literature that i used to devise a treatment program was pretty good depression is just too complicated what you really need is a nutritional scan this is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your bodies nutrient reserves for every vitamin and mineral except vitamin c you have a reserve the rda is not designed to give you enough of any nutrient to keep these reserves full it is only designed to keep them from being emptied which would cause clinical pathology stress will increase your need for many vitamins and minerals this is when your reserves become very important lida without your permission i m going to use your post as a conduit to try to explain to the readers in this group and sci med where i m coming from i have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the osteopathic medical schools for ten years now i ve written my own textbook because none was available what i teach is not a rehash of biochemistry i preach nutrient reserves yes my lectures in this course are referred to by my students as sermons here is what i cover indroduction and carbohydrates lipids proteins i proteins ii energy balance evaluation of nutritional status i a clinical perspective evaluation of nutritional status ii evaluation of nutritional a biochemical perspective status iii homework assignment using the nutritionist iv diet and fitness analysis software program weight control food fads and facts age related change in nutrient requirements food additives contaminants and cancer drug nutrient interactions mineral and water balance sodium potassium and chloride calcium magnesium and phosphorus iron zinc and copper iodine and fluoride other trace minerals vitamin a vitamin e vitamins d and k vitamin c thiamin and niacin riboflavin and pyridoxine pantothenic and folic acids biotin and b other nutrient factors enteral nutrition parenteral nutrition every three years i spend my entire summer reviewing the medical literature to find material that i can use in my nutrition textbook i last did this in the summer of i read everything that i can find and then sit down and rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books that have and pages opposite each page of written text which i write myself i ve pulled figures tables and graphs from various copyrighted sources since this material is only being used for educational purposes i can get around the copyright laws so far i can not send this material out to newsgroup readers as i ve been asked to do i am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition assessment lab this is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that i need to make my education program complete this lab will let me measure the nutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to be required in humans the mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to design supplement programs for their cancer patients cancer treatment centers of america which is a private for profit organization with hospitals in illinois and oklahoma tulsa also operates a nutritional assessment clinical lab i also believe that the pritikin clinic in california has a similiar lab setup for physicians reading this post i would suggest that you get the new clinical nutrition textbook that has just been published feb by mosby i have been using alpers manual of nutritional therapeutics a little brown series book as a supplemental text for my course but alpers is geared more to residency training two m d s have written this new clinical nutrition textbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it does a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a patient s nutritional status let me quote a few sentences from the preface of this new text so called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists hematologists or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge of nutrition as it related to their field of practice unfortunately about two thirds of the medical schools in the united states require no formal instruction in nutrition but times and medical practice have changed more than half of the leading causes of death in this country are nutrition related this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives it should complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of nutrition to your medical practice and it should heighten your awareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important for both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially every organ system roland l weinsier md drph lida my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find a physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals yes even magnesium may play a role in depression play in depression and who could get a nutritional profile run menopause is often a time when women suffer depression there are a lot of hormonal changes that are occuring but they are not the same ones that occur during pms a nutritionist may also be able to help not too long ago a poster mentioned that his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red cell glutathionine peroxidase test the specific test for the selenium reserve most clinical labs will not run this test and i advised him to try to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified there are also a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral analysis but these labs are not regulated checks of these labs using certified standards and also those doing water lead analysis showed some pretty shoddy testing was going on if you or anyone else finds someone who will run these speciality nutrition tests make sure that they are using a lab that has been certified under clia the clinical laboratory improvement act a diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown to correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging and software analysis nutritionist iv and other software programs but there are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not show a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status until we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the u s and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional profile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses diet changes and supplementation anti depressants will probably continue to be the best approach to depression martin banschbach ph d professor of biochemistry and

re earwax hi stephen ear wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections both by preventing a barrier and also with some antibiotic properties too much can block the external auditory canal the hole in the outside of the ear and cause some hearing problems it is very simple and safe to remove excess wax on your own or at your physician s office you can take a syringe no needles and fill it with warm water cold can cause fainting and otc hydrogen peroxide then point the ear towards the ceiling about degrees up and insert the tip of the syringe helps to have someone else do this and firmly expell the solution depending on the size of the syringe and the tenacity of the wax this could take several rinses if you place a bowl under the ear to catch the water it will be much drier you can buy a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy or just use whatever you may have if wax is old it will be harder and darker you can try adding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up the wax do this for a couple days then try syringing again it is also safe to point your ear up at the shower head and allow the water to rinse it out good luck heather

re chromium as dietary suppliment for weight loss in article apr newsgate sps mot com rhca melton sps mot com henry melton writes my wife has requested that i poll the sages of usenet to see what is known about the use of chromium in weight control diet suppliments she has seen multiple products advertising it and would like any kind real information my first impulse was yuck a metal but i have zero data on it what do you know henry melton i ll tell you all that i know about chromium but before i do i want to get a few things off my chest i just got blasted in e mail for my kidney stone posts kidney stones are primarily caused by diet as is heart disease and cancer when i give dietary advise it is not intended to encourage people reading this news group or sci med nutrition where i do most of my posting to avoid seeing a doctor nothing can be further from the truth kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to be ruled out but once it is diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance same thing with heart disease and cancer if you suspect that you may have a problem with one of these diseases don t use what i m going to tell you or what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor you have to go hopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help you change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment program but the odds are that you will not and that s why i m here when my wife detected a lump in here breast i didn t say don t worry my vitamin e will take care of it any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician plan and simple if it s begnin which most are fine then maybe a diet change and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring but let me tell you right now if you have tried diet and supplementation and another lump returns get your butt into the doctor s office as fast as your little feet can carry you better yet have a mammography done on a regular basis my wife kept putting her s off both myself and her gynocologist told her she needed to have one done her gynocologist even scheduled one but she didn t show up too busy running the operating room for the biggest hospital in tulsa one more thing i am not an orthomolecular nutritionist this group uses high dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have drug actions in the body but you talk about flying blind man this is really blind treatment no drug could ever be used as these vitamins and minerals are being used i m not saying that some of this stuff couldn t be right on the money it may well be but my approach to nutrition is a lot like that of weinsier and morgan the two m d s who wrote the new clinical nutrition textbook my push is the nutrient reserves and the lab tests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet changes to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you handle stress that s where i m coming from folks blast away if you want i m not going to change put me in your killfile if you want i really don t care i m averaging e mail messages a day from people who think that i ve got something important to say but i m also getting hit by a few with an axe to grind that s life chromium is one of the trace elements it has a very limited but very important role in the body it is used to form glucose tolerance factor gtf gtf is made up of chromium nicinamide niacin glycine cysteine and glutamic only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to form gtf some foods already have gtf liver brewers or nutritional yeast and black pepper when chromium is in gtf a pretty good absorption is seen about but when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral chelate chromium picolinate it s absorption is much lower to lowest for all the minerals i ve been posting in misc fitness and chromium has come up there several times as a fat burner chromium is among the least toxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really do any harm i wouldn t do it though the adequate and safe range for chromium is to ug per day the average american is getting about ug per day from his her diet chromium levels decrease with age and many believe that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency i can cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in type ii diabetes but i m not going to because for each positive one there also seems to be a negative one as well i m convinced that the problem is bioavailability when yeast gtf is used good results are obtained but when chromium itself is used the results are usually negative in addition to type ii diabetes chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and glucoma again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is concerned since a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease this possible link with chromium isn t too surprising glucoma is a little more interesting muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin responsive glucose driven metabolic function if this eye focusing activity is impaired by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response intraocular pressure is believed to be elevated in a fairly large study of pts with glaucoma the one consistent finding was a low rbc chromium j am coll nutr but this one preliminary study should not prompt people to go out and start popping chromium supplements for one thing just about every older person is going to have a low rbc chromium unless they have been taking chromium suppleemnts yeast since glucoma is often found in older people it s not too surprising that chromium was low in the rbc s if chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma that would prompt some attention i suspect that there will be a clinical trail to check out this possible chromium link to glucoma you could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the rbc chromium test or hair analysis most clinical labs are not going to run a rbc chromium there are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail analysis for you but i wouldn t use them there is just too much funny business going on in these unregulated labs right now here s weinsier and morgan advise on chromium they do not consider chromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is available they don t like the hair and nail analysis labs either and they also recognize the rbc chromium is primarily a research test that is not routinely available in most clinical chemistry labs this has to change and as more labs run a rbc chromiuum it will what then do they suggest make a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical response to chromium run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium supplementation once you make the diagnosis put the patient on ug of crcl orally each day or grams of yeast per day what s my advise don t take chromium supplements to try to loose weight they just do not work that way if you want to take them and then exercise that would be great do include yeast as part of your diet most americans are not getting enough chromium from their diet if you do have a poor glucose tolerance ask your doctor to check your chromium status when he or she says what in the world are you talking about just say please get a copy of weinsier and morgan s new clinical nutrition textbook and do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose tolerance if you can t do that i ll find a doctor who can thank you very much marty b

re candida yeast bloom fact or fiction in article rp p d usenet ins cwru edu esd po cwru edu elisabeth s davidson writes in a previous article banschbach vms ocom okstate edu says least a few enlightened physicians practicing in the u s it s really too bad that most u s medical schools don t cover nutrition because if they did candida would not be viewed as a non disease by so many in the medical profession case western reserve med school teaches nutrition in its own section as well as covering it in other sections as they apply i e b deficiency in neuro as a cause of neuropathy b deficiency in hematology as a cause of megaloblastic anemia yet i sill hold the viewpoint of mainstream medicine candida can cause mucocutaneous candidiasis and in already very sick patients with damaged immune systems like aids and cancer patients systemic candida infection i think the yeast connection is a bunch of hooey what does this have to do with how well nutrition is taught anyway elisabeth let s set the record straight for the nth time i have not read the yeast connection so anything that i say is not due to brainwashing by this hated book it s okay i guess to hate the book by why hate me elisabeth i m going to quote from zinsser s microbiology th edition a book that you should be familiar with and not hate candida species colonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly thereafter the risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present indeed candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic mycosis neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic infection candidiasis so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or sick neutrophils to see a systemic infection poor diet and persistent parasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis your assessment of candidiasis in the u s is correct and i do not dispute it what i posted was a discussion of candida blooms without systemic infection these blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation gi tract mouth vagina and sinus cavity knocking down the bacterial competition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida blooms let me quote from zinsser s again however some factors such as the use of a broad spectrum antibacterial antibiotic may predispose to both mucosal and systemic infections i was addressing mucosal infections i like the term blooms better the nutrition course that i teach covers this effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the cure i guess that your nutrition course does not too bad here is a brief primer on yeast yeast infections as they are commonly called are not truely caused by yeasts the most common organism responsible for this type of infection is candida albicans or monilia which is actually a yeast like fungus well maybe i m getting picky but i always thought that a yeast was one form that a fungus could exist in the other being the mold form many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds depending on environment candida exibits what is known as reverse dimorphism it exists as a mold in the tissues but exists as a yeast in the environment should we maybe call it a mold infection a fungus infection maybe we should say it is caused by a mold like fungus martin banschbach ph d professor of biochemistry and chairman department of biochemistry and microbiology osu college of osteopathic medicine west th st tulsa ok you re the chairman of biochem and micro and you didn t know that a yeast is a form of a fungus shudder or maybe you did know and were oversimplifying my my elisabeth do i detect a little of steve dyer in you if you noticed my faculty rank i m a biochemist not a microbiologist candida is classifed as a fungus according to zinsser s but as you point out it displays dimorphism it is capable of producing yeast cells pseudohyphae and true hyphae elisabeth you are probably a microbiologist and that makes a lot of sense to you to a biochemist it s a lot of greek so i called it a yeast like fungus go ahead and crucify me you know elisabeth i still haven t been able to figure out why such a small little organism like candida can bring out so much hostility in people in sci med and i must admitt that i got sucked into the mud slinging too i keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what i ve said that it will make sense i m not asking anyone here to buy into the yeast connection book because i don t know what s in that book plain and simple and to be honest with you i m beginning to wish that it was never written marty b

antihistamine for sleep aid for a very long time i ve had a problem with feeling really awful when i try to get up in the morning my sleep latency at night is also pretty long ranging from min to an hour i get about hours of bedtime maybe of actual sleep a night and more on the weekends i will spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if i can because i feel so tired when i wake up even more tired than i was when i went to bed which is usually too tired to work anyway i recently had a really bad flu so i called a friend to get me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant but he got vicks formula m which has everything but an expectorant so i used that anyway and the three nights i used it i fell asleep rapidly and felt that i got really good quality sleep that is i actually felt refreshed the next morning so i am now trying to look into both in the literature and experimentally the use of antihistamines as sleep aids since i am presuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect the antihistamine in vicks formula is chloriphenamine maleate so i bought some generic tablets of that and tried one last night and didn t notice any improvement i might try one with a little alcohol about beer to see if it is a synergism effect also library research seems to show that benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongest sedative effect of what is availible otc so i might also buy a generic form of that and try that the pdr seems to suggest that mg is a good dosage level to try for other medical information i have allergies but rarely have an allergic reaction living in new mexico i also have chronically dry eyes which get horrible if i try to use most underarm deoderants i did guess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia so i made some changes in my diet consistent with that and it didn t help so i went back to a normal diet pretty diverse also taking vitamin supplements anyway i am looking for advice for the use of antihistamines as sleep aids and if there are any dangers of such use seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies by millions i don t want to try bzs because bz addiction seems to be a serious threat and from what i hear bz sleep quality is not good whereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me i have tried some dietary tryptophan loading stuff and that also seems to lower sleep quality i seem to wake up around or so and be in some kind of mental haze until or also i would be interested in any other advice for helping my problem although i ve already tried many of the non pharmacological solutions

re robert s biological alchemy robert i m so glad that you posted your biological alchemy discussion i ve been compared to the famous robert mcelwaine by some readers of sci med i didn t know how to respond since i had not seen one of your posts just like i haven t read the yeast connection let me just start by stating that the authors of the cold fusion papers of recent years are now in scientific exile i believe that one has actually left the country scientific fraud is rare i m still not sure that if a review of the research notes of the cold fusion scientists actually proved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation your sources do not seem to be research articles they are more like lay texts designed to pique human interest in a subject area just like the food combining and life extension texts robert i try to keep an open mind but some things i just can t buy one is taking sod orally to prevent oxidative damage in the body your experiment if conducted by readers of this news group would prove that you are right more ash after seed sprouting than before unless you use a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature above degrees i believe you will get organic residue in the ash even the residue in commercial incinerators contains organic residue i remember doing this kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in college but i couldn t find a temperature for mineral ash formation so i m really guessing at degrees f it may actually be much higher the point is that no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to produce only a mineral ash they also could not measure the minerals so they could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct chemical reactions abound in our body in our atmosphere in our water and in our soil are these fusion reactions yes many of them do involve fusing oxygen nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics do we really have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with silicon not in my book robert silicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet i ve seen speculation that man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon based life form i like reading science fiction as many people do but i know enough about biochemistry and nutrition to be able in most cases to separate the fiction from the fact silicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in humans we have several grams of the stuff in our body what s it doing there only the lord knows right now but i will tell you what i do know about silicon and why as you state it helps bone healing and it is not because silicon is transformed into calcium almost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective tissue collagen and elastin there have been studies published which show that the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective factor against atherosclerosis the higher the silicon content in elastin the more resistant the elastin is to a an age related loss of elasticity which may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as part of the ageing process in humans for bone fracture healing the first step is a collagen matrix into which calcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts a high level of silicon in the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation this first step in the bone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going electriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming cells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in the gap or gaps between the ends of the broken bone a vitamin c deficiency by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of defective collagen does slow down both bone and wound healing zinc is also another big player in bone and wound healing and so is silicon in an undetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not transformation of silicon to calcium for you to take this bone healing observation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into calcium is an interesting little trick but robert i have the same problem myself when i read the lay press and yes even some scientific papers is the explanation reasonable without a very good science knowledge base you and most readers of this news group are flying blind you have to take it on faith because you don t know any better if the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base i m inclined to consider it this usually means trying to find other sources that come to the same conclusion if the idea like a candida bloom seems to make sense to me i tend to pursue it as long as any advice that i m going to give isn t going to really mess somebody up if this makes us kindred souls robert then i guess i ll have to live with that label for the physicians who have decided to read my response to robert s interesting post i hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric neurosurgeon last night on u s tv i can t remember the network or his name like many nights i was on my computer and my wife was watching tv in our den where i have my computer setup this neurosurgeon takes kids with brain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses unconventional treatments his own words he says that he has a success rate the one case that i heard him discussing would normally use radiation conventional treatment he was going to go in and cut you guys complain about the cost of the anti fungals what do you think the cost difference between radiation treatment and surgery is guys i m going to ask you guys one more time why blast a physician who takes the chronic sinus sufferer like jon and the chronic gi sufferer like elaine and tries to help them using unconventional treatments treatments which do not result in death like those that the neurosurgeon uses is it because candida blooms are not life threatening while brain tumors are how about quality of life guys may the candida demon never cross your sinus cavity or gut if it does you may feel differently about the issue marty b

re thyroidal deficiency in article apr cc ic ac uk ewolff ps ic ac uk erik the viking writes hi my wife has aquired some thyroidal sp deficiency over the past year that gives symptoms such as needing much sleep coldness and proneness to gaining weight she has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary tests and her values were regarded as low the doctor and my wife are not very interested in starting medication as this deactivates the gland giving life long dependency to the drug hormone my questions are has anyone had heard of success in using this approach her values have been slowly but steadily sinking any comment on the probability of improvement although the doctor has told her to eat normally my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feels that is part of keeping an edge over the illness condition may this affect the treatment development there are several different types of thyroid diseases which would cause a hypothyroid condition reduction in the output of the thyroid mainly thyroxin except for ones caused by infections the treatment is generally thyroxin pills hypothyroid conditions caused by infections usually disappear when the infection does this doesn t sound like the case with your wife thyroxin orally does shut down the thyroid through a feedback loop involving the pituitary i believe the pituitary thinks that the correct amount of thyroxin is being produced so it doesn t have to tell the thyroid to produce more this process is reversable i have hashimoto s thyroiditis an autoimmune condition and was on thyroxin for approx mo when my endocrinologist suggested i not take the pills for wks when i was retested for thyroxin levels they were normal i still get tested every mo because the condition might reappear the pills are safe and have very few side affects those mostly at beginning of treatment having a baby might be a problem and would at least require closer monitoring of hormone levels thyroxin controls energy production which explains sleepiness coldness and weight gain there is also water retention possibly around heart changes in vision and coarser hair and skin among other things i am not a doctor so i m sure i mistated something but the important thing is that thyroid problems are usually easily corrected and if they aren t corrected can cause problems in the rest of the body get a second opinion from a good endocrinologist and have him her explain things in detail to you and your wife eileen bauer
vitamin a and infection i ve sent gordon r my posts on protein vitamin c and vitamin a prior to posting on internet as a professional courtesy somehow i ve managed to delete my vitamin a post from my text file gordon r had promised to send it back to me but he s pretty mad at me right now so i ll just retype it since digging through all my references is very time consuming took me all day for that pms post i m not going to cite any references gordon r has them i m going to include some of the material from weinsier and morgan s new nutrition textbook which was not in my original material to point out that what i m going to say has some support in the medical community diet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very very long time protein has always had the biggest role in infection and i ve already covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection now i m going to hit what i consider to be the most important nutrient in the u s as far as infection is concerned vitamin a when vitamin a was originally discovered it was commonly referred to as the anti infection vitamin many people linus pauling being one have decided to take this title away from vitamin a and give it to vitamin c which i ve already covered big mistake in my opinion vitamin a is also getting a reputation as an anti cancer vitamin with good reason the nci currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if vitamin a can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well it s role in both cancer and infection is almost identical but not quite vitamin a comes in two completely different forms retinol and beta carotene retinol is the animal form and it s toxic beta carotene is the plant form and it s completely nontoxic both retinol and beta carotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present the liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other tissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein rbp a normal human adult liver should have iu to iu of retinol stored we are born with iu in our liver u s autopsy has shown that about of americans die with the same or less amount of vitamin a as they were born with if you don t believe that nutritional reserves like that of retinol in the liver are important then this low vitamin a reserve is not going to affect you but if you believe like i do that the nutrient reserves are important then there is a problem with vitamin a in the u s the u s rda for vitamin a in an adult male is re or iu of vitamin a for adult feamles its re or iu of vitamin a diet surveys show that most americans are getting this amount of vitamin a either retinol or beta carotene from their diet but the nrc national research council was going to release a new rda table in that had the rda for both vitamin a and vitamin c raised c to mg per day and a to iu per day for adult males that report and it s recommendations was killed why concern over the increasing supplementation was the main reason rdas are set to prevent clinical disease not to keep nutrient reserves full many scientist in the u s feel that the time has come to move away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move towards the promotion of optimum health concept especially since we have some very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely important during periods of stress the nutritonal concervatives won that battle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the rda list which lowered the rda for several nutrients and moved the dietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the s get enough to prevent clinical pathology but not enough to fill the reserves we know from autopsy that only about of americans have a liver with a normal vitamin a reserve iu to iu i preach nutrient reserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients but for vitamin a only a liver biopsy or autopsy data will tell you how much somebody has stored we can tell very easily if someone has overfilled his or her liver with vitamin a by measuring the serium retinol level levels above ug dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your liver with vitamin a and it s time to stop taking retinol the normal range of serum retinol will be ug dl hypervitaminosis a is diagnosed with a serum retinol level of ug dl or higher interpretation of diagnostic test wallach m d a little brown series book this level of vitamin a in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to vitamin a toxicity weinsier and morgan take a much more conservative approach to vitamin a toxicity than does wallach as you will see later in this post between ug dl and ug dl you should have plenty of warning that it s time to eliminate the retinol from your diet headache redness of the skin hair loss joint pain i tell all my students that will use vitamin a in their practice that they had better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear signs that the liver is full you will never really know if the patient needs the vitamin a because you can not measure the pool in liver but you will always know when it s time to stop just like in those vitamin a for pms studies beta carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will never have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta carotene to retinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down stops in the liver and slows down in the gut when your liver is full of retinol but taking beta carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to fill the liver up i ve seen estimates of years if you are in the that only has as much as you were born with in your liver iu one other problem with beta carotene if you have a zinc deficit you will not convert as much beta carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the enxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc in addition the release of retinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will cause a vitamin a deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin a now what does vitamin a do in cancer and infection protection the body uses vitamin a retinol for many different things vision the first to be nailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology uses the aldehyde retinal and alcohol retinol form of vitamin a reproduction uses the retinol form and some retinal infection and cancer protection uses retinoic acid how do you convert retinol which your white blood cells and the mucosal cells get from blood to retinoic acid you use enzymes one of which requires vitamin c this is why pauling has tried to pull the title of anti infection vitamin away from vitamin a vitamin c does play a role in infection interferon production for example but it s biggest role is the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid if you increase your intake of vitamin c you will increase your formation of retinoic acid but retinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol as retinal can and once it s formed it s used and then lost to the body this is why the nrc group wanted to increase both vitamin c and vitamin a rda s most people taking large amounts of vitamin c really think that they are helping themselves if they don t have much vitamin a in their liver and they are not also increasing their intake of vitamin a they actually do themselves more harm than good retinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation in the mucus membrane it is the main factor in promoting good mucus production and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from entering the blood system the mucus membrane is referred to as the first line defense against infection for cancer retinoic acid has been shown to act as a cell brake it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which stimulate cells to divide cancer has two distinct steps dna alteration and cell promotion for cells that normally divide all the time promoters are not that important but for lung and breast tissue which does not normally divide promoters are real important in the malignant process this is the major reason why the nci has so many different clinical trials in progress using retinol and or beta carotene chronic infection irritation of the mucus membranes is a signal that vitamin a may not be adequate i tell my students that any patient who walks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be worked up for vitamin a along with the other factors that medicine already has on it s list of causes for chronic infection i drive this home in my course at the osteopathic college in tulsa when i teach at the allopathic medical school in tulsa ou s branch campus and when i give cme lectures dark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin a status since night vision is impacted when liver reverves drop to iu of retinol the serum level of retinol can also be used but it does not drop until liver reserves drop below to iu asking a patient if they have trouble seeing at night is a good initial screen if cataracts are ruled out in one study done on u s spanish americans where serum retinol levels were measured of the sample population had a serum retinol level below ug dl as more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of the u s that have had a history of high infection rates we will probably see a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low serum retinol levels what do weinsier and morgan have to say about vitamin a here are excerpts from their book vitamin a functions in vision in the forrm of retinol it is necessay for growth and differentation of epithelial tissue and is required for reproduction embryonic development and bone growth protein calorie malnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption transport and metabolism of vitamin a retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid which has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not in reproduction or vision the most common procedure to evaluate vitamin a status is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum the normal range for vitamin a content for a child is to ug dl lower values are indicators of deficiency or depleted body stores serum levels greater than ug dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin a dark adaptation tests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to perform on young children rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to vitamin a deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state the bronchorespiratory tract skin genitourinary system gastrointestinal tract and sweat glands are adversely affected a daily intake of more than mg about iu of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts over mg iu can result in a dry and itching skin desquamation erythematous dermatitis hair loss joint pain chapped lips hyperostois bony depositis headaches anorexia edema and fatigue they recommend mg of retinol via im injection in children for vitamin a deficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults their toxic serum retinol level is very conservative i recommend that my students try iu in adults that are having problems with chronic infection they have to rule out a zinc deficit first by getting an rbc zinc run or if their clinical lab can t run it i tell them to do what weinsier and morgan suggest give them the zinc along with the vitamin a at iu per day toxicity should not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the patient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol both elaine and jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin a recall that the pms papers were using iu to iu of vitamin a i don t suggest that my students use these high doses if you wanted to fill the liver up fast as part of a clinical trial and were monitoring the serum retinol level then you would be okay but my knowledge of the vitamin a literature suggests to me that iu for patients with a demonstrated vitamin a deficit dark adapatation test or serum retinol will provide a good and steady improvement as long as zinc and vitamin c status are good without having to worry about toxicity if they want to get more agressive fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol but vitamin a retinol should never be given in high dose to women who could become pregnant since vitamin a shows teratogenicity towards the human fetus the dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is iu of retinol per day beta carotene will never have this effect on the human fetus could just taking beta carotene instead of retinol supplements help yes but the effect will take a long time to develop my advise is to use retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta carotene to keep it full vitamin a is probably one nutrient that is better off left to prescription by doctors but when we have the m d s in this newsgroup jumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin a supplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and gi distress i think that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin a in the otc market but require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general public about the dangers of vitamin a supplementation marty b

re thermoscan ear thermometer in article ashwin may leo gatech edu ashwin cc gatech edu ashwin ram writes does the thermoscan instrument really work it is supposed to give you a fast and accurate temperature reading in the ear how far in the ear does one have to insert the instrument is it worth the it is currently selling for no they do not work well my doctor started using one recently and i thought the concept was so amazing that i bought one too the thing works by reading the infrared emissions from the ear drum the ear drum is hotter than the ear canal walls so you have to point the thing very carefully this means tugging on the top of the ear to straighten out the ear canal then inserting the thing snugly then pushing a button unfortunately there are many things that can go wrong it is almost impossible to aim the thing correctly when you do it on yourself i get readings which differ from each other by up to degrees and may differ from an oral thermometer by up to degrees i talked to one of the nurses in my doctor s office recently about this and she said she didn t like them either for same reasons she did give me some instruction on how to tug on my ear and what correct insertion feels like but she said she thought it was impossible to do correctly on one s self she also said that she and other nurses had complained to the company about inaccurate readings and that someone from the company had told them to take great care to clean the infrared window at the end of the probe with alcohol from time to time she demonstrated this prior to reading my temperature and managed to get a reading within degree of the oral temperature i took at home before driving to the dr s office i have also noticed tha some nurses click the button then remove the probe immediately this causes wrong readings in my experience you have to leave the probe in a good to seconds after clicking the button to get a good measurement the nurse i talked with agreed i suspect that many people don t realize this and therefore get bad readings for yet another reason in short it s a great idea it may work for some folks but i believe it doesn t work well for a person who wants to take his own temperature

re persistent vs chronic in article blue cis pitt edu doyle pitt edu howard r doyle writes chronic persistent hepatitis is usually diagnosed when someone does a liver biopsy on a patient that has persistently elevated serum transaminases months after a bout of acute viral hepatitis or when someone is found to have persistently elevated transaminases on routine screening tests the degree of elevation in the serum transaminases can be trivial or as much as ten times normal other blood chemistries are usually normal as a rule patients with cph have no clinical signs of liver disease chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic at least initially and that s why it s important to tell them apart by means of a biopsy the patient with cph only needs to be reassured the patient with cah needs to be treated i just went back to the chapter in cecil on chronic hepatitis it seems that indeed most cases of cph are persistant viral hepatitis whereas there are a multitude of potential and probable causes for cah viral drugs alcohol autoimmune etc physicians seem to have a variety of thresholds for electing to biopsy someone s liver personally i think that if the patient is asymptomatic with only slight transaminitis and normal albumin and pt one can simply follow them closely and not add the potential risks of a biopsy others may well biopsy such a patient thus providing these samples for study it would be interesting to see if anyone s done any decision analysis on this kenneth gilbert university of pittsburgh general internal medicine dammit not a programmer

kazakhstan republic aboard those boosters were a new breed of venera probe for the planet venus designated venera and the probes were meant not for landing yet more spherical craft on the venerean surface but to radar map the planet in detail from orbit to accomplish this task the basic venera design was modified in numerous areas the central bus core was made one meter inches longer to carry the two tons of propellant required for braking into orbit double the fuel carried by the venera and orbiters eight years earlier extra solar panels were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging the dish shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger to properly transmit this information to earth atop the buses where landers were usually placed were installed the by meter by foot kilogram pound polyus v side looking radar antennae the radar system possibly a terrain imaging version of the nuclear powered satellites used by the soviets for earth ocean surveillance would be able to map venus surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers to miles the soviet probes imaging parameters were a vast improvement over the united states pioneer venus orbiter which could reveal objects no smaller than kilometers miles in diameter and while the veneras resolution was comparable to that of similar observations made by the meter foot arecibo radio telescope on the island of puerto rico the orbiters would be examining the northern pole of venus this region was unobtainable by either arecibo or pioneer venus and appeared to contain a number of potentially interesting geological features worthy of investigation on october after an interplanetary journey of million kilometers million miles and two mid course corrections venera fired its braking rockets over venus to place itself in a polar orbit by kilometers by miles around the planet completing one revolution every twenty four hours venera followed suit four days later the twin probes thus became venus first polar circling spacecraft radar operations began on october for venera and october for venera for up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north pole the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface kilometers ninety miles wide and nine thousand kilometers miles long the craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back to two large soviet antennae on earth each strip of information took eight hours to process by computer by the end of their main missions in july of the veneras had mapped million square kilometers million square miles thirty percent of the entire planet venera and revealed that venus has a surface geology more complex than shown by pioneer venus in the late s numerous hills mountains ridges valleys and plains spread across the landscape many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the last one billion years in planetary terms this makes the venerean surface rather young hundreds of craters were detected as well the largest of which had to have been created by meteorites planetoids would be a better term here at least fourteen kilometers miles across due to venus very dense atmosphere there were some disagreements between u s and soviet scientists on the origins of certain surface features for example the probes owners declared that the kilometer mile wide crater at the summit of meter foot high maxwell montes the tallest mountain on the planet was the result of a meteorite impact american scientists on the other hand felt the crater was proof that maxwell was a huge volcano sitting on the northern continent of ishtar terra in any event the u s decided to wait on making verdicts about venus until the arrival of their own radar probe scheduled for later in the decade originally named the venus orbiting imaging radar voir its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig nated the venus radar mapper vrm eventually the machine would be called magellan after the portuguese navigator ferdinand magellan circa this vehicle would map the entire planet in even finer detail than the veneras for the time however the soviet probes maintained that distinction radar imaging was not the only ability of the veneras bolted next to the polyus v radar antenna were the omega altimeter and the fourier infrared spectrometer the latter for measuring the world s temperatures the majority of the areas covered registered about five hundred degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit but a few locations were two hundred degrees hotter possibly indicating current volcanic activity the probes also found that the clouds over the poles were five to eight kilometers three to miles lower than at the equator in contrast the polar air above sixty kilometers thirty six miles altitude was five to twenty degrees warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights when the main mapping mission ended in july of there were plans for at least one of the veneras to radar image the surface at more southernly latitudes unfortunately this idea did not come to pass as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude control gas to perform the operation venera and ceased transmission in march of leaving the soviet institute of radiotechnology and electronics with six hundred kilometers miles of radar data tape to sort into an atlas of twenty seven maps of the northern hemisphere of venus venus by balloon for years the thick atmosphere of venus had been a tempting target to scientists who wished to explore the planet s mantle of air with balloon borne instruments professor jacques blamont of the french space agency centre national d etudes spatiales cnes had proposed such an idea as far back as only to have a joint french soviet balloon mission canceled in nevertheless late in the year such dreams would eventually come true when two proton rockets were sent skyward on december and the soviet union provided western observers with the first clear full views of the booster which had been launching every soviet venus probe since this was but one of many firsts for the complex mission the unmanned probes launched into space that december were named vega and a contraction of the words venera and gallei gallei being the russian word for halley not only did the spacecraft have more than one mission to perform they also had more than one celestial objective to explore namely the comet halley this famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from the formation of the solar system five billion years ago scientists around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such bodies which actually come close to earth most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar system some like halley are perturbed by various forces and fall in towards the sun where they circle for millennia spewing out ice and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar encounter the soviet union along with the european space agency esa and japan s institute of space and astronautical science isas did not wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a close examination of halley the esa would be using the cylindrical giotto probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the comet while japan s first deep space craft sakigake pioneer and suisei comet would view halley from a much safer distance scientists in the united states also desired to study the comet from the vantage of a space probe at one time envisioning a vessel powered by solar sails or ion engines however government budget cuts to nasa canceled the american efforts the u s would have to make do primarily with earth based observations and the sharing of data from other nations though an instrument named the dust counter and mass analyzer ducma designed by chicago university professor john simpson was added on the soviet mission in may of the soviets answer to halley were the vegas instead of building an entirely new craft for the mission the soviets decided to modify their venera bus design to encounter the comet while performing an advanced venus mission along the way as vega and reached venus the buses would drop off one lander balloon each and use the mass of the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet halley much as the u s probe mariner used venus to flyby mercury eleven years earlier the soviet craft would then head on to halley helping to pinpoint the location of the comet s erupting nucleus for the giotto probe to dive in only kilometers miles away in march of as planned the two vegas arrived at venus in june of vega released its payload first on the ninth day of the month the lander making a two day descent towards the planet the craft touched the upper atmosphere on the morning of june sixty one kilometers miles above the venerean surface a small container was released by the lander which produced a parachute at kilometers miles altitude thus the first balloon probe ever to explore venus had successfully arrived one kilometer after the opening of the parachute helium gas was pumped into the teflon coated plastic balloon inflating it to a diameter of meters feet dangling on a tether thirteen meters feet below was the instrument package properly known as an aerostat the top part of the kilogram pound aerostat consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment point to the balloon beneath it was the transmitter electronics and instruments connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for measuring cloud particles the aerostat was painted with a special white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which permeated the planet s atmosphere the vega balloon was dropped into the night side of venus just north of the equator scientists were concerned that the gas bag would burst in the heat of daylight so they placed it in the darkened hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data this action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as well effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions the author wonders though if they could have used floodlights similar to the ones attached to venera and in when soviet scientists had thought the planet s surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight due to the permanently thick cloud cover the first balloon transmitted for hours right into the day hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed covering kilometers miles the threat of bursting in the day heat did not materialize the vega balloon was stationed at a kilometer mile altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers thirty miles for this was considered the most active of the three main cloud layers reported by pioneer venus in indeed the balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to kilometers miles per hour strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and down two to three hundred meters to feet through most of the journey the layer s air temperature averaged forty degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit and pressure was a mere earth atmosphere the nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds early in the first balloon s flight the vega lander was already headed towards the venerean surface both landers were equipped with a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on venera and in however vega would become unable to report the composition of the ground at its landing site in rusalka planitia the mermaid plain north of aphrodite terra while still ten to fifteen minutes away from landing a timer malfunction caused the drill to accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers miles above the surface there was neither any way to shut off the instrument before touchdown nor reactivate it after landing this was unfortunate not only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of venus was covered with such smooth low level lava plains and had never before been directly examined nevertheless the surface temperature and pressure was calculated at degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit and earth atmospheres respectively during the lander s minutes of ground transmissions a large amount of background infrared radiation was also recorded at the site as had been done when the drills and cameras on venera and had failed in december of the soviets focused on the data returned during the lander s plunge through the atmosphere the french soviet malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur chlorine and possibly phosphorus it is the sulfur possibly from active volcanoes which gives the venerean clouds their yellowish color the sigma gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air between an altitude of and kilometers and miles contained one milligram grain of sulfuric acid the vega data on the overall structure of the cloud decks appeared to be at odds with the information from pioneer venus the case was made even stronger by the fact that vega s results nearly matched its twin the vegas found only two main cloud layers instead of the three reported by the u s probes the layers were three to five kilometers to miles thick at altitudes of and kilometers and miles the clouds persisted like a thin fog until clearing at an altitude of kilometers miles much lower than the pv readings one possibility for the discrepan cies may have been radical structural changes in the venerean air over the last seven years when the lander and balloon finally went silent the last functioning part of the vega mission the flyby bus sailed on for a million kilometer million mile journey around the sun to become the first probe to meet comet halley on march the bus made a kilometer mile pass at the dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space the soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial bodies with one space vessel on june vega released its lander balloon payload for a two day fall towards venus like its duplicate the vega balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking it on earth for hours before battery failure on the morning side of the planet during its kilometer mile flight over venus the second balloon entered in a rather still environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission after hours mission time the air became even more turbulent for a further eight hours when the balloon passed over a five kilometer three mile mountain on the continent of aphrodite terra a powerful downdraft pulled the craft kilometers miles towards the surface temperature sensors on the vega balloon reported that the air layer it was moving through was consistently degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit cooler than the area explored by the vega balloon this was corroborated by the vega lander as it passed through the balloon s level no positive indications of lightning were made by either balloon and the second aerostat s nephelometer failed to function the vega lander touched down on the northern edge of aphrodite terra s western arm on the fifteenth of june kilometers miles southeast of vega the lander s resting place was smoother than thought indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a relatively young one covered in fresh lava the soil drill was in working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite troctolite rare on earth but present in luna s highlands this rock is rich in aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium a high degree of sulfur was also present in the soil the air around vega measured degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit and earth atmospheres essentially a typical day or night on venus far above the vega lander its carrier bus sped past venus at a distance of kilometers miles and followed its twin to comet halley making a closer flyby on march at just kilometers miles both probes helped to reveal that the comet is a very dark and irregular shaped mass about fourteen kilometers miles across rotating once every hours give or take three hours since both vega craft were still functioning after their halley encounters soviet scientists considered an option to send the probes to other celestial objects one prime target was the near earth planetoid adonis which vega could pass at a distance of six million kilometers million miles sadly the soviets had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach adonis as planned vega and were quietly shut down in early future plans diverted the impressive vega mission had given some scientists numerous ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second world from the sun one example was the vesta mission planned for the early s this soviet french collaboration called for the launch of multiple probes on a single proton rocket in either or the craft would first swing by venus and drop off several landers and balloon probes the aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet s corrosive atmosphere for up to one month a large improvement over the vega balloons two days the mission would then head out to investigate several planetoids and comets including a possible landing on vesta thus the mission name the most reflective main belt planetoid as seen from earth unfortunately for venus exploration plans began to change in the soviet union in the soviets decided to reroute the vesta mission to the red planet mars instead of venus keeping the comet and planetoid aspects intact by this time in the soviet space program interest was focusing on mars already under construction was an entirely new probe design called phobos two members of this class were planned to leave earth in and orbit mars the next year phobos and would then place the first instruments on mars largest moon phobos all this was a prelude to even more advanced mars expeditions including balloon probes rovers soil sample return craft and eventually human explorers in the early twenty first century the environment of venus was just too hostile for any serious consideration of human colonization in the near future but things began to look bleak for soviet venus and mars exploration both phobos probes failed to complete their missions one losing contact on the way to the red planet in and the other going silent in mars orbit just one week before the planned moon landing in march of in a plan was devised for a venus orbiter to drop eight to ten penetrators around the planet in several years later the mission launch date was moved to the year and has now been put on indefinite hold no other official soviet missions to venus have since been put forth a sad commentary after twenty five years of continuous robotic exploration of the planet during the late s a drastic political and economic change was taking over the soviet union president mikhail gorbachev began to open up his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with the rest of the nations particularly those in the west while the culture became less oppressive than in the past the economy was taking a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a free market these effects hit everywhere including the space program missions at all levels were cut back the soviets began making almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space faring nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to make money in early it was reported that the soviets were offering for sale several fully equipped veneras they had in storage for the price of million dollars each an incredibly low price for any planetary probe no nation took them up on the bargain meanwhile the united states was gearing up for new venus missions of their own magellan and galileo the u s reactivated their long dormant planetary exploration with the launch of the space shuttle atlantis on may aboard the shuttle was the magellan spacecraft a combination of spare parts from other u s probes designed to make the most detailed and complete radar mapping of venus in history when magellan reached the second world in august of it would be able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of meters feet surpassing the abilities of venera and in the interim another american probe was launched from a space shuttle which would make a quick flyby of venus on its way to orbit the giant planet jupiter in on october the shuttle atlantis released its second unmanned planetary probe into space named galileo after the famous italian astronomer who discovered the probe s primary target s major moons in in the absence of a powerful enough booster to send galileo on a direct flight to the jovian planet the probe was sent around venus and earth several times to build up enough speed to reach jupiter as a result venus became galileo s first planetary goal in february of the probe radioed back images of the planet s swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in that violent atmosphere on the drawing boards with the incredible success of magellan in the last few years new plans have been laid out for further journeys to venus scien tists in the u s have talked to space scientists in the former soviet union now the commonwealth of independent states since january of a cooperative effort to launch new venera lander missions within in the next decade japan india and the esa have also considered their own venus missions in the next few decades in february of nasa came up with several new venus projects as part of their discovery program for launching inexpensive probes throughout the solar system for venus two missions were selected for further study a venus multiprobe mission involving the landing of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds air temperature and pressure and the venus composition probe designed to study venus atmosphere while descending through the thick air with the aid of a parachute much as the soviets had done since final project decisions will be made in humans on venus will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of venus at present the lead melting temperatures and crushing air pressure would be threatening to any earth life not protected in something even tougher than a venera lander plans have been looked into changing the environment of venus itself into something more like earth s however it should be noted that any such undertaking will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide atmosphere a major reduction in surface heat and the ability to speed up the planet s rotation rate to something a bit faster than once every earth days such a project may take centuries if not millennia in the meantime efforts should be made to better understand venus as its exists today we still have yet to fully know how a world so seemingly similar to earth in many important ways became instead such a deadly place will earth ever suffer this fate perhaps venus holds the answers such answers may best be found through

update back to the moon bill introducing the back to the moon in congress the next step the next key hurdle for the lunar resources data purchase act is introduction of the act in congress at this point many congresspersons have been approached about the bill however for a successful effort to pass the bill we need the best possible congressperson to introduce the bill due to his position as chair of the house committee on space and science congressman george brown is the logical choice he has a long record of support and interest in space development and helped pass the launch services purchase act and the space settlements act there is a small group of activists in southern california who have assisted george brown in his recent re election campaigns we are mobilizing this group to have them tell congressman brown about the back to the moon bill we are also asking pro space constituents to let him know that they care about getting america back to the moon finally there is a good chance that a nationwide alert for space activists to call or write george brown to have him introduce the back to the moon bill may be staged during late spring all this should produce a positive reaction from brown s office as more is known it will be passed on however even if we are successful in getting him to support the bill this alone will not ensure passage of the bill for any bill to become law one of three conditions must exist either the bill must reflect widespread national support for an issue such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits be propelled by high priced lobbyists we re out of luck there or have widespread support within congress due to small but widespread constituent support the latter is the path that we by necessity must choose this means that the introduction of the lunar resources data purchase act must be immediately accompanied by a large number of congresspersons sponsorship of the bill to accomplish this we need activists to ask their congressperson to support the lunar resources data purchase act now to wait until the bill is introduced is simply too late it takes time to have a congressperson s staff review a bill if your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet introduced please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently written we appreciate all comments on the bill from activists and politicians if you have yet to see the back to the moon bill please request a copy by email please include your u s postal service address or contact your local chapter of the national space society maximus wb

report on redesign team the following is what they feed to us most has been posted already but there are a number of items not seen here yet redesign activities update following is the weekly status on redesign based on information provided by nasa headquarters the station redesign team srt provided a detailed status report to the advisory committee on the redesign of the space station on april the day long meeting was held in anser facilities in crystal city va topics covered by the srt included a preliminary mission and goals statement for the space station science technology and engineering research the assessment process and the design approach discussions on management options and operations concepts also were held the design teams then presented the three options under study option a modular buildup pete priest presented the a option priest said the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has identified three distinct phases of evolution power station human tended and permanent presence the team will define the minimum capability needed to achieve each phase the total cost of each phase and the achievable capability for budget levels the a option uses current or simplified freedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing systems such as the so called bus spacecraft the orbiter and spacelab the power station capability could be achieved in flights with freedom photo voltaic modules providing kw of power day shuttle spacelab missions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase human tended capability would be provided by the addition of the u s common module module which adds subsystems and payload racks and docking ports for esa and japanese laboratories day missions with the orbiter docked to the station are assumed for this phase different operation utilization modes are being studied for this phase option b freedom derived mike griffin presented the status of option b activities griffin detailed the evolution of the freedom derived option from initial research capability to human tended capability to permanent human presence capability to two fault tolerance and finally permanent human capability griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the baseline program with minor changes to the communications and tracking system crew health care system and eclss and a major change to the data management system initial research capability would be achieved with flights to degree inclination flights to degrees and consist of an extended duration orbiter spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with photo voltaic arrays providing kw of power human tended capability would be achieved in flights and add truss segments and the u s lab permanent human presence capability would be achieved in flights with two orbiters providing habitation and assured crew return two fault tolerance achieved in flights would build out the other section of truss with another set of pv modules thermal control and propulsion systems the freedom derived configuration could achieve an international complete state with flights three more flights to bring up the habitat module a third pv array and two assured crew return vehicles acrv would complete the permanent human capability with international stage griffin told the redesign advisory committee that eliminating hardware would not by itself meet budget guidelines for the freedom derived option major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including program management contractor non hardware early utilization and operations costs he said option c singe launch core station chet vaughn presented option c the single launch core station concept a shuttle external tank and solid rocket boosters would be used to launch the station into orbit shuttle main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch and jettisoned after et separation the module feet in diameter and feet long would provide cubic feet of pressured volume separated into decks connected by a centralized passageway seven berthing ports would be located at various places on the circumference of the module to place the international modules and other elements this can would have two fixed photo voltaic arrays producing approximately kw of power flying in a solar interial attitude in his closing comments to the redesign advisory committee bryan o connor said a design freeze would be established for the options on april so that detailed costing of the options can begin the next meeting with the redesign advisory committee will be may russian consultants arrive in u s a delegation of russian space experts arrived in the u s on april and briefings to the srt by members of the russian team began on the nd the group includes russian space agency general director y m koptev and v a yatsenko also of the rsa others on the team include representatives from the ministry of defense the design bureau salyut the institute of biomedical problems the ministry of foreign affairs npo energia and tsnijmash the russian team briefed the srt on environmental control and life support system docking systems the proton launch vehicle mir operations and utilization and the soyuz tm spacecraft the russian consultants are available to the srt to assess the capabilities of the mir space station and the possible use of mir and other russian capabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign they will be available to the srt through may management and operations review continues work continued in the srt subgroups the management group under dr walt brooks is working to develop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a foundation for the transition to development and operations various management options have been developed including lead center with the center director in the programmatic chain of command host center with the program manager reporting directly to an associate administrator skunk works dedicated program office with a small dedicated co located hand picked program office combine space station with shuttle with the space station becoming an element of the current program major tune up to current organization with current contracts and geographical distribution maintained but streamlined the operations group under dr john cox is building on the work of the operations phase assessment team lead by gene kranz of nasa jsc which had already begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its preliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible as part of its work the operations group has identified teams of agency experts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of assembly and operations utilization maintenance and logistics and testing and ground operations what s in the week ahead the design support teams will provide a comprehensive status of their option to the station redesign team on monday and tuesday at which point the design will be frozen to begin the detailed cost assessment also this week the team will begin preparing for the next round of discussions with the redesign advisory committee to be held may dr shea steps down dr joe shea stepped down as director of the station redesign team on april and bryan o connor will take over the activities of the team dr shea submitted his resignation as assistant deputy administrator for space station analysis but will continue to serve as a special advisory to nasa administrator goldin and be available to consult with the srt mr goldin accepted the resignation so that a request from dr shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated key milestones the

the universe of motion book review book review the universe of motion by dewey b larson north pacific publishers portland oregon pages indexed hardcover the universe of motion contains final solutions to most all astrophysical mysteries this book is volume iii of a revised and enlarged edition of the structure of the physical universe volume i is nothing but motion and volume ii is the basic properties of matter most books and journal articles on the subject of astrophysics are bristling with integrals partial differentials and other fancy mathematics in this book by contrast mathematics is conspicuous by its absence except for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text larson emphasizes concepts and declares that mathematical agreement with a theory does not guarantee its conceptual validity dewey b larson was a retired engineer with a bachelor of science degree in engineering science from oregon state university he developed the theory described in his books while trying to find a way to mathematically calculate the properties of chemical compounds based only on the elements they contain the universe of motion describes the astrophysical portions of larson s consistent integrated comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe a kind of grand unified field theory that orthodox physicists and astro physicists claim to be looking for it is built on two postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of space and time the physical universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time the physical universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is euclidean from these two postulates larson was able to build a complete theoretical universe from photons and subatomic particles to the giant elliptical galaxies by combining the concept of inward and outward scalar motions with translational vibrational rotational and rotational vibrational motions at each step in the development he was able to match parts of his theoretical universe with corresponding parts in the real physical universe including even things not yet discovered for example in his book he first predicted the existence of exploding galaxies several years before astronomers started finding them they are a necessary consequence of his comprehensive theory and when quasars were discovered he had a related explanation ready for those also as a result of his theory which he called the reciprocal system larson totally rejected many of the sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists including black holes neutron stars degenerate matter quantum wave mechanics as applied to atomic structure nuclear physics general relativity relativistic mass increases relativistic doppler shifts nuclear fusion in stars and the big bang all of which he considered to be nothing more than mathematical fantasies he was very critical of the ad hoc assumptions uncertainty principles solutions in principle no other way declarations etc used to maintain them the universe of motion is divided into chapters it begins with a description of how galaxies are built from the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in from the anti matter half of the physical universe galaxy formation from the mythical big bang is a big mystery to orthodox astronomers he then goes on to describe life cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and solar systems result from type i supernova explosions of single stars several chapters are devoted to quasars which according to larson are densely packed clusters of stars that have been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies and are actually traveling faster than the speed of light although most of that speed is away from us in time astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against observations that contradict their theories would find larson s explanations quite valuable if considered with an open mind for example they used to believe that gamma ray bursts originated from pulsars which exist primarily in the plane or central bulge of our galaxy but the new gamma ray telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from all directions uniformly and do not correspond with any visible objects except for a few cases of directional coincidence larson s explanation is that the gamma ray bursts originate from supernova explosions in the anti matter half of the physical universe which larson calls the cosmic sector because the anti matter universe exists in a reciprocal relation to our material universe with the speed of light as the boundary between them and has three dimensions of time and only one dimension of space the bursts can pop into our material universe anywhere seemingly at random larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from books journal articles and leading physicists and astronomers in this book of them are superscripted with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the end of the book for example a quote from the book astronomy the cosmic journey by william k hartmann says our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars form unfortunately we cannot larson s book contains logical consistent explanations of such mysteries that are worthy of serious consideration by all physicists astronomers and astrophysicists for more information answers to your questions etc please consult my cited sources larson s books un altered

long term human missions mike adams suggested discussions on long term effects of spaceflight to the human being i love this topic as some of you regulars know so having seen henry s encouraging statement about starting to talk about it i shall i feel that we as a community of people have unique resources to deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborate on the utility of spaceflight to fields which are as divergent as medical intensive care agriculture environmental protection and probably more i do not believe that the general public understands the impact of spaceflight on the whole of society in the absence of such knowledge we see dwindling support of the world s space effort i believe that we as a group have the responsibility to not only communicate amongst ourselves but also with others through print media a well orchestrated and technically oriented analysis of life science variables required to support long duration spaceflight like long expenditions to the moon or mars would be entertaining and educational to the general public the objective of such an effort would be to compile resources and publications from accepted scientific and technical journals which would address each major life science area in addition ideas for further research and development could be put forward for the general public to ponder allowing the general public to take part in the excitement of exploration individuals interested should be willing to devote an hour per week to running literature searches and finding journal articles in addition we need to obtain the assistance of personnel from within the halls of nasa and industry i have appreciated the positive responses to date and i am personally eager to start this project perhaps we could start with debate regarding how best to grade the viability of various technologies for application to spaceflight ken

re gamma ray bursters where are they well i seem to have struck an interesting discussion off given that i am not an astrophysicist or nuclear physicist i ll have to boil it down a bit all the data on bursts to date shows a smooth random distribution that means they aren t concentrated in galactic cores our or someone elses if the distribution is smooth we are either seeing some enormously large phenomena scattered at the edge of the universe said phenomena being subject to debate almost as vioent as the phenomena or we are seeing some phenomena out at like the oort cloud but then it needs some potent little energy source that isn t detectable by any other current methods we know it s not real close like slightly extra solar because we have no parallax measurements on the bursts the bursts seem to bright to be something like black hole quanta or super string impacts or something like that so everyone is watching the data and arguing like mad in the meanwhile what i am wondering is this in people s opinion a new physics problem einstein got well known for solvingthe photoelectric effect copernicus started looking at irregularities in planetary motion is this a big enough problem to create a new area of physics just a little speculative thinking folks pat

re what planets are habitable i would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for humans i am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range of physical aspects of the planet the question is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions this is a good question there are major blind spots in our understanding of what makes the earth habitable for example why does the earth s atmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does the naive answer is photosynthesis but this is clearly incomplete photosynthesis by itself can t make the atmosphere oxygenated as the oxygen produced is consumed when the plants decay or are eaten what is needed is photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of the resulting reduced material on earth this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic matter mostly from oceanic sources however this burial requires continental sediments in the deep ocean the burial rate is so slow that most material is consumed before it can be sequestered this suggests that a planet without large oceans or a planet without continents undergoing weathering will have a hard time accumulating an oxygen atmosphere in particular an all ocean planet may have a hard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere there is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth s atmosphere has been relatively stable over geological time for a period at least orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric o to weathering in the absence of replenishment no convincing feedback mechanism has been identified perhaps the reason is the weak anthropic principle if during the last myr or so the oxygen level had dropped too low we wouldn t be here to be wondering about it paul f dietz dietz cs rochester edu

interstellar t is k notes on pluto charon talk and pluto mission sci space readers can skip the first paragraph yesterday in response to henry spencer s question about the temperature of a blackbody in interstellar space i said dust grains acts as blackbodies and they re at k well i was dead wrong our local interstellar dust expert bruce draine has informed me that dust grains aren t good radiators in the far ir which is why they are so warm actually the ambient radiation field from distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only or kelvin sorry henry and anyone else i misled obviously time for me to take another ism class in other news alan stern of the southwest research institute gave a talk on the pluto charon binary system yesterday he gave a brief overview of the currently accepted system parameters volume ratio of about mass ratio about or so plus lots more and then gave his thoughts on the formation of pluto charon his idea is that there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer solar system with masses distributed as a power law of some kind over time the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies most got scattered out of the solar system by close encounters with jupiter and saturn but many accreted into the gas giants especially uranus and neptune a large planetesimal was captured by neptune we call it triton captured how perhaps by a collision with a smaller already existing neptunian moon perhaps by a very close passage through neptune s atmosphere mondo aerobraking he notes that the two recently discovered kuiper belt objects qb and fw plus chiron and pholus are all about the same mass and he identifies this group as one accretion down from the larger bodies of triton and pluto charon pluto charon he thinks formed when an impacting body hit proto pluto knocking some material into a ring around pluto which later accreted in charon similar to ideas about the formation of earth s moon there is good evidence from spectra that the surfaces of pluto and charon are very different pluto has methane frost charon doesn t which can be used as evidence for the impact theory he believes that there may be around pluto to chiron sized objects remaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside neptune s orbit beyond au or so qb and fw are the first members of this population to be found in his model note that such bodies will be very dark since if their surfaces are covered with methane frost it will have photolyzed into very dark long chain hydrocarbons by now the reason that pluto has such a high albedo around i think is that its surface warms up just enough around perihelion to sublimate and when the atmosphere freezes out again thirty years later it forms bright new frost so any bodies much farther away than au are going to be very hard to see i hope i haven t made any errors in the transcription if you see a howling mistake it s undoubtedly mine not his by the way he s one of the top guns behind the pluto fast flyby mission i think and said that the current plans are to use a titan to send the probe on just about a rectilinear trajectory to pluto we were speaking loosely at the time he d like to use a proton which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs much less his figures million for titan launches there will be two separate probes launched separately or million for proton launches he told a story about how the soviets originally offered to sell proton launches for million each but were forced to increase their prices in the us in order to be allowed in the marketplace i m just telling you what he said michael michael richmond this is the heart that broke my finger richmond astro princeton edu

galileo update forwarded from neal ausman galileo mission director galileo mission director status report post launch april spacecraft on april and delta differenced one way range dor passes were performed over dss goldstone madrid meter antennas and dss goldstone canberra meter antennas respectively initial results indicate the delta dor pass on april was unsuccessful due to ground station hardware problems but the one on april was successfully performed on april a cruise science memory readout mro was performed for the magnetometer mag instrument analysis indicates the data was received properly on april the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the spacecraft stored sequence these relays were commanded closed by the cds command data subsystem prior to launch and were again commanded closed to preclude the possibility at jupiter of the pps relays wiring being a source of internal electrostatic charge iesd on april cruise science memory readouts mro were performed for the extreme ultraviolet spectrometer euv dust detector dds and magnetometer mag instruments preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly during the period from april to april a navigation cycle was performed this navigation cycle provided near continuous acquisition of two way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the spacecraft over dss dss and dss on april real time commands were sent to test slew the radio relay antenna rra in preparation for the mini sequence slew test on april the rra was slewed from approximately degrees from stow to approximately degrees preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about degrees which was well within the predicted range the rra was commanded back to approximately degrees from stow preliminary analysis indicated the antenna reached about degrees also well within the predicted range the rra motor temperature was at degree c at the start of the activity and had increased to degrees c at its completion after verifying proper rra slewing the rra slew test mini sequence was uplinked to the spacecraft for execution on april upon successful uplink a delayed action command dac was sent which will reposition the stator on may to its initial pre test position also a dac was sent to turn the two way noncoherent twnc on april prior to the start of the rra slew test mini sequence on april a no op command was sent to reset the command loss timer to hours its planned value during this mission phase on april the rra slew test executed nominally the spacecraft under stored sequence control performed six rra slews starting at about degrees from stow and going to degrees back to degrees then to degrees back to degrees then to degrees and then back to degrees all of the slews were well within the predicted range the rra motor temperature was at degrees c at the start of the activity and had increased to degrees c at its completion after completion of the rra slews real time commands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre test configuration the ac dc bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change greater than dn throughout this period the ac measurement reads dn volts the dc measurement reads dn volts these measurements are consistent with the model developed by the ac dc special anomaly team the spacecraft status as of april is as

geographic region introduction from our small world we have gazed upon the cosmic ocean for untold thousands of years ancient astronomers observed points of light that appeared to move among the stars they called these objects planets meaning wanderers and named them after roman deities jupiter king of the gods mars the god of war mercury messenger of the gods venus the god of love and beauty and saturn father of jupiter and god of agriculture the stargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails and meteors or shooting stars apparently falling from the sky science flourished during the european renaissance fundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were discovered and the orbits of the planets around the sun were calculated in the th century astronomers pointed a new device called the telescope at the heavens and made startling discoveries but the years since have amounted to a golden age of solar system exploration advancements in rocketry after world war ii enabled our machines to break the grip of earth s gravity and travel to the moon and to other planets the united states has sent automated spacecraft then human crewed expeditions to explore the moon our automated machines have orbited and landed on venus and mars explored the sun s environment observed comets and made close range surveys while flying past mercury jupiter saturn uranus and neptune these travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and understanding of the solar system through the electronic sight and other senses of our automated spacecraft color and complexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared to earth bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light and dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered future historians will likely view these pioneering flights through the solar system as some of the most remarkable achievements of the th century automated spacecraft the national aeronautics and space administration s nasa s automated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many shapes and sizes while they are designed to fulfill separate and specific mission objectives the craft share much in common each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments selected for a particular mission supported by basic subsystems for electrical power trajectory and orientation control as well as for processing data and communicating with earth electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft instruments and systems nasa uses both solar energy from arrays of photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its solar system missions rechargeable batteries are employed for backup and supplemental power imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed millions of miles through space to fly but one time near a planet only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments pointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target to help prevent such a mishap a subsystem of small thrusters is used to control spacecraft the thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a constant gaze at selected stars just as earth s early seafarers used the stars to navigate the oceans spacecraft use stars to maintain their bearings in space with the subsystem locked onto fixed points of reference flight controllers can keep a spacecraft s scientific instruments pointed at the target body and the craft s communications antennas pointed toward earth the thrusters can also be used to fine tune the flight path and speed of the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at the planned distance and on the proper trajectory between and nasa spacecraft were dispatched to study the moon and the solar environment they also scanned the inner planets other than earth mercury venus and mars these three worlds and our own are known as the terrestrial planets because they share a solid rock composition for the early planetary reconnaissance missions nasa employed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the mariners their flights helped shape the planning of later missions between and seven mariner missions conducted the first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space all of the mariners used solar panels as their primary power source the first and the final versions of the spacecraft had two wings covered with photovoltaic cells other mariners were equipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal bodies although the mariners ranged from the mariner venus spacecraft weighing in at kilograms pounds to the mariner mars orbiter weighing in at kilograms pounds their basic design remained quite similar throughout the program the mariner venus spacecraft for example had originally been a backup for the mariner mars flyby the mariner spacecraft sent to venus and mercury used components left over from the mariner mars orbiter program in nasa launched pioneer a jupiter spacecraft interest was shifting to four of the outer planets jupiter saturn uranus and neptune giant balls of dense gas quite different from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed four nasa spacecraft in all two pioneers and two voyagers were sent in the s to tour the outer regions of our solar system because of the distances involved these travelers took anywhere from months to years to reach their destinations barring faster spacecraft they will eventually become the first human artifacts to journey to distant stars because the sun s light becomes so faint in the outer solar system these travelers do not use solar power but instead operate on electricity generated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes nasa also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit our neighbors mars and venus in the middle and late s twin viking landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather stations and as biology laboratories two advanced orbiters descendants of the mariner craft carried the viking landers from earth and then studied martian features from above two drum shaped pioneer spacecraft visited venus in the pioneer venus orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument that allowed it to see through the planet s dense cloud cover to study surface features the pioneer venus multiprobe carried four probes that were dropped through the clouds the probes and the main body all of which contained scientific instruments radioed information about the planet s atmosphere during their descent toward the surface a new generation of automated spacecraft including magellan galileo ulysses mars observer the comet rendezvous asteroid flyby craf and cassini is being developed and sent out into the solar system to make detailed examinations that will increase our understanding of our neighborhood and our own planet the sun a discussion of the objects in the solar system must start with the sun the sun dwarfs the other bodies representing approximately percent of all the mass in the solar system all of the planets moons asteroids comets dust and gas add up to only about percent this percent represents the material left over from the sun s formation one hundred and nine earths would be required to fit across the sun s disk and its interior could hold over million earths as a star the sun generates energy through the process of fusion the temperature at the sun s core is million degrees celsius million degrees fahrenheit and the pressure there is billion times earth s air pressure at sea level the sun s surface temperature of degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit seems almost chilly compared to its core temperature at the solar core hydrogen can fuse into helium producing energy the sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams of charged particles both extending far beyond the planets the sun appears to have been active for billion years and has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or so at the end of its life the sun will start to fuse helium into heavier elements and begin to swell up ultimately growing so large that it will swallow earth after a billion years as a red giant it will suddenly collapse into a white dwarf the final end product of a star like ours it may take a trillion years to cool off completely many spacecraft have explored the sun s environment but none have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately two thirds of the distance from earth to the sun pioneers the pioneer venus orbiter voyagers and and other spacecraft have all sampled the solar environment the ulysses spacecraft launched on october is a joint solar mission of nasa and the european space agency after using jupiter s gravity to change its trajectory ulysses will fly over the sun s polar regions during and and will perform a wide range of studies using nine onboard scientific instruments we are fortunate that the sun is exactly the way it is if it were different in almost any way life would almost certainly never have developed on earth mercury obtaining the first close up views of mercury was the primary objective of the mariner spacecraft launched on november from kennedy space center in florida after a journey of nearly five months which included a flyby of venus the spacecraft passed within kilometers miles of the solar system s innermost planet on march until mariner little was known about mercury even the best telescopic views from earth showed mercury as an indistinct object lacking any surface detail the planet is so close to the sun that it is usually lost in solar glare when the planet is visible on earth s horizon just after sunset or before dawn it is obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere only radar telescopes gave any hint of mercury s surface conditions prior to the voyage of mariner the photographs mariner radioed back to earth revealed an ancient heavily cratered surface closely resembling our own moon the pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the planet these apparently were created when mercury s interior cooled and shrank buckling the planet s crust the cliffs are as high as kilometers miles and as long as kilometers miles instruments on mariner discovered that mercury has a weak magnetic field and a trace of atmosphere a trillionth the density of earth s atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon neon and helium when the planet s orbit takes it closest to the sun surface temperatures range from degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit on mercury s sunlit side to degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit on the dark side this range in surface temperature degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit is the largest for a single body in the solar system mercury literally bakes and freezes at the same time days and nights are long on mercury the combination of a slow rotation relative to the stars earth days and a rapid revolution around the sun earth days means that one mercury solar day takes earth days or two mercury years the time it takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the sun mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like that of earth scientists believe mercury has a heavy iron rich core making up slightly less than half of its volume that would make mercury s core larger proportionally than the moon s core or those of any of the planets after the initial mercury encounter mariner made two additional flybys on september and march before control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted and the mission was concluded each flyby took place at the same local mercury time when the identical half of the planet was illuminated as a result we still have not seen one half of the planet s surface venus veiled by dense cloud cover venus our nearest planetary neighbor was the first planet to be explored the mariner spacecraft launched on august was the first of more than a dozen successful american and soviet missions to study the mysterious planet as spacecraft flew by or orbited venus plunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on venus surface romantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to rest on december mariner passed within kilometers miles of venus and became the first spacecraft to scan another planet onboard instruments measured venus for minutes mariner launched in june flew much closer to the planet passing within kilometers miles of venus on the second american flyby mariner s instruments measured the planet s magnetic field ionosphere radiation belts and temperatures on its way to mercury mariner flew by venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to earth showing cloud circulation patterns in the venusian atmosphere in the spring and summer of two spacecraft were launched to further unravel the mysteries of venus on december of the same year the pioneer venus orbiter became the first spacecraft placed in orbit around the planet five days later the five separate components making up the second spacecraft the pioneer venus multiprobe entered the venusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet the four small independent probes and the main body radioed atmospheric data back to earth during their descent toward the surface although designed to examine the atmosphere one of the probes survived its impact with the surface and continued to transmit data for another hour venus resembles earth in size physical composition and density more closely than any other known planet however spacecraft have discovered significant differences as well for example venus rotation west to east is retrograde backward compared to the east to west spin of earth and most of the other planets approximately percent of venus atmosphere times as dense as earth s is carbon dioxide the principal constituent of earth s atmosphere is nitrogen venus atmosphere acts like a greenhouse permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but trapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into space as a result the planet s average surface temperature is degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit hot enough to melt lead a radio altimeter on the pioneer venus orbiter provided the first means of seeing through the planet s dense cloud cover and determining surface features over almost the entire planet nasa s magellan spacecraft launched on may has been in orbit around venus since august the spacecraft uses radar mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh resolution images of the surface magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic features faults and impact craters huge areas of the surface show evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows lying on top of previous ones an elevated region named ishtar terra is a lava filled basin as large as the united states at one end of this plateau sits maxwell montes a mountain the size of mount everest scarring the mountain s flank is a kilometer mile wide kilometer mile deep impact crater named cleopatra almost all features on venus are named for women maxwell montes alpha regio and beta regio are the exceptions craters survive on venus for perhaps million years because there is no water and very little wind erosion extensive fault line networks cover the planet probably the result of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics on earth but on venus the surface temperature is sufficient to weaken the rock which cracks just about everywhere preventing the formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like the san andreas fault in california venus predominant weather pattern is a high altitude high speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid at speeds reaching as high as kilometers miles per hour the clouds circle the planet in only four earth days the circulation is in the same direction west to east as venus slow rotation of earth days whereas earth s winds blow in both directions west to east and east to west in six alternating bands venus atmosphere serves as a simplified laboratory for the study of our weather earth as viewed from space our world s distinguishing characteristics are its blue waters brown and green land masses and white clouds we are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting of percent nitrogen percent oxygen and percent other constituents the only planet in the solar system known to harbor life earth orbits the sun at an average distance of million kilometers million miles earth is the third planet from the sun and the fifth largest in the solar system with a diameter just a few hundred kilometers larger than that of venus our planet s rapid spin and molten nickel iron core give rise to an extensive magnetic field which along with the atmosphere shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation coming from the sun and other stars earth s atmosphere protects us from meteors as well most of which burn up before they can strike the surface active geological processes have left no evidence of the pelting earth almost certainly received soon after it formed about billion years ago along with the other newly formed planets it was showered by space debris in the early days of the solar system from our journeys into space we have learned much about our home planet the first american satellite explorer was launched from cape canaveral in florida on january and discovered an intense radiation zone now called the van allen radiation belts surrounding earth since then other research satellites have revealed that our planet s magnetic field is distorted into a tear drop shape by the solar wind the stream of charged particles continuously ejected from the sun we ve learned that the magnetic field does not fade off into space but has definite boundaries and we now know that our wispy upper atmosphere once believed calm and uneventful seethes with activity swelling by day and contracting by night affected by changes in solar activity the upper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on earth besides affecting earth s weather solar activity gives rise to a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere when charged particles from the solar wind become trapped in earth s magnetic field they collide with air molecules above our planet s magnetic poles these air molecules then begin to glow and are known as the auroras or the northern and southern lights satellites about kilometers miles out in space play a major role in daily local weather forecasting these watchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms continuous global monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and contributes to a better understanding of earth s complex weather systems from their unique vantage points satellites can survey earth s oceans land use and resources and monitor the planet s health these eyes in space have saved countless lives provided tremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our planet in dangerous ways the moon the moon is earth s single natural satellite the first human footsteps on an alien world were made by american astronauts on the dusty surface of our airless lifeless companion in preparation for the human crewed apollo expeditions nasa dispatched the automated ranger surveyor and lunar orbiter spacecraft to study the moon between and nasa s apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials and data six two astronaut crews landed on and explored the lunar surface between and carrying back a collection of rocks and soil weighing a total of kilograms pounds and consisting of more than separate samples from this material and other studies scientists have constructed a history of the moon that includes its infancy rocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about billion years old the first few million years of the moon s existence were so violent that few traces of this period remain as a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into different kinds of rock the moon was bombarded by huge asteroids and smaller objects some of the asteroids were as large as rhode island or delaware and their collisions with the moon created basins hundreds of kilometers across this catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four billion years ago leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge overlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken rock heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to melt the interior of the moon at depths of about kilometers miles below the surface then for the next million years from about to billion years ago lava rose from inside the moon the lava gradually spread out over the surface flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas that galileo galilei an astronomer of the italian renaissance called maria meaning seas as far as we can tell there has been no significant volcanic activity on the moon for more than three billion years since then the lunar surface has been altered only by micrometeorites by the atomic particles from the sun and stars by the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and astronauts if our astronauts had landed on the moon a billion years ago they would have seen a landscape very similar to the one today thousands of years from now the footsteps left by the apollo crews will remain sharp and clear the origin of the moon is still a mystery four theories attempt an explanation the moon formed near earth as a separate body it was torn from earth it formed somewhere else and was captured by our planet s gravity or it was the result of a collision between earth and an asteroid about the size of mars the last theory has some good support but is far from certain mars of all the planets mars has long been considered the solar system s prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life astronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what appeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface these observations later determined to be optical illusions led to the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a system of irrigation canals on the planet in when orson welles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction classic war of the worlds by h g wells enough people believed in the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic another reason for scientists to expect life on mars had to do with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet s surface this phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might support a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months and cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods so far six american missions to mars have been carried out four mariner spacecraft three flying by the planet and one placed into martian orbit surveyed the planet extensively before the viking orbiters and landers arrived mariner launched in late flew past mars on july coming within kilometers miles of the surface transmitting to earth close up pictures of the planet the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring channels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water mariners and followed with their flybys during the summer of and returned pictures mariners and showed a diversity of surface conditions as well as a thin cold dry atmosphere of carbon dioxide on may the mariner orbiter was launched on a mission to make a year long study of the martian surface the spacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift off only to find mars in the midst of a planet wide dust storm that made surface photography impossible for several weeks but after the storm cleared mariner began returning the first of pictures these revealed previously unknown martian features including evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across the surface etching river valleys and flood plains in august and september the viking and spacecraft each consisting of an orbiter and a lander lifted off from kennedy space center the mission was designed to answer several questions about the red planet including is there life there nobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities but it was hoped that the biology experiments on the viking landers would at least find evidence of primitive life past or present viking lander became the first spacecraft to successfully touch down on another planet when it landed on july while the united states was celebrating its bicentennial photos sent back from the chryse planitia plains of gold showed a bleak rusty red landscape panoramic images returned by the lander revealed a rolling plain littered with rocks and marked by rippled sand dunes fine red dust from the martian soil gives the sky a salmon hue when viking lander touched down on utopia planitia on september it viewed a more rolling landscape than the one seen by its predecessor one without visible dunes the results sent back by the laboratory on each viking lander were inconclusive small samples of the red martian soil were tested in three different experiments designed to detect biological processes while some of the test results seemed to indicate biological activity later analysis confirmed that this activity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet s soil chemistry is there life on mars no one knows for sure but the viking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist there the viking landers became weather stations recording wind velocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and pressure few weather changes were observed the highest temperature recorded by either craft was degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit at the viking lander site in midsummer the lowest temperature degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit was recorded at the more northerly viking lander site during winter near hurricane wind speeds were measured at the two martian weather stations during global dust storms but because the atmosphere is so thin wind force is minimal viking lander photographed light patches of frost probably water ice during its second winter on the planet the martian atmosphere like that of venus is primarily carbon dioxide nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small percentages martian air contains only about as much water as our air but even this small amount can condense out forming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around the slopes of towering volcanoes local patches of early morning fog can form in valleys there is evidence that in the past a denser martian atmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet physical features closely resembling shorelines gorges riverbeds and islands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet mars has two moons phobos and deimos they are small and irregularly shaped and possess ancient cratered surfaces it is possible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too close to mars and were captured by its gravity the viking orbiters and landers exceeded by large margins their design lifetimes of and days respectively the first to fail was viking orbiter which stopped operating on july when a leak depleted its attitude control gas viking lander operated until april when it was shut down because of battery degeneration viking orbiter quit on august when the last of its attitude control gas was used up viking lander ceased functioning on november despite the inconclusive results of the viking biology experiments we know more about mars than any other planet except earth nasa s mars observer spacecraft to be launched in september will expand our knowledge of the martian environment and lead to human exploration of the red planet asteroids the solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic objects that are in orbit around the sun but are too small to be considered full fledged planets these objects are known as asteroids or minor planets most but not all are found in a band or belt between the orbits of mars and jupiter some have orbits that cross earth s path and there is evidence that earth has been hit by asteroids in the past one of the least eroded best preserved examples is the barringer meteor crater near winslow arizona asteroids are material left over from the formation of the solar system one theory suggests that they are the remains of a planet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago more likely asteroids are material that never coalesced into a planet in fact if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was gathered into a single object the object would be only about kilometers miles across less than half the diameter of our moon thousands of asteroids have been identified from earth it is estimated that are bright enough to eventually be photographed through earth based telescopes much of our understanding about asteroids comes from examining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of earth asteroids that are on a collision course with earth are called meteoroids when a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at high velocity friction causes this chunk of space matter to incinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor if the meteoroid does not burn up completely what s left strikes earth s surface and is called a meteorite one of the best places to look for meteorites is the ice cap of antarctica of all the meteorites examined percent are composed of silicate stone and percent are composed of iron and nickel the rest are a mixture of the three materials stony meteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much like terrestrial rocks since asteroids are material from the very early solar system scientists are interested in their composition spacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found that the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are separated by very large distances current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids for closer examination the galileo orbiter launched by nasa in october will investigate main belt asteroids on its way to jupiter the comet rendezvous asteroid flyby craf and cassini missions will also study these far flung objects scheduled for launch in the latter part of the s the craf and cassini missions are a collaborative project of nasa the european space agency and the federal space agencies of germany and italy as well as the united states air force and the department of energy one day space factories will mine the asteroids for raw materials jupiter beyond mars and the asteroid belt in the outer regions of our solar system lie the giant planets of jupiter saturn uranus and neptune in nasa dispatched the first of four spacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these colossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock jupiter was the first port of call pioneer which lifted off from kennedy space center in march was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid belt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system in december it returned the first close up images of jupiter flying within kilometers miles of the planet s banded cloud tops pioneer followed a year later voyagers and were launched in the summer of and returned spectacular photographs of jupiter and its family of satellites during flybys in these travelers found jupiter to be a whirling ball of liquid hydrogen and helium topped with a colorful atmosphere composed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium ammonia ice crystals form white jovian clouds sulfur compounds and perhaps phosphorus may produce the brown and orange hues that characterize jupiter s atmosphere it is likely that methane ammonia water and other gases react to form organic molecules in the regions between the planet s frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying below because of jupiter s atmospheric dynamics however these organic compounds if they exist are probably short lived the great red spot has been observed for centuries through telescopes on earth this hurricane like storm in jupiter s atmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet as a high pressure region the great red spot spins in a direction opposite to that of low pressure storms on jupiter it is surrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and are sometimes consumed by it the great red spot might be a million years old our spacecraft detected lightning in jupiter s upper atmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to earth s northern lights at the jovian polar regions voyager returned the first images of a faint narrow ring encircling jupiter largest of the solar system s planets jupiter rotates at a dizzying pace once every hours minutes seconds the massive planet takes almost earth years to complete a journey around the sun with known moons jupiter is something of a miniature solar system a new mission to jupiter the galileo project is under way after a six year cruise that takes the galileo orbiter once past venus twice past earth and the moon and once past two asteroids the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into jupiter s cloud layers and relay data back to earth the galileo orbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close to jupiter s large moons exploring in detail what the two pioneers and two voyagers revealed galilean satellites in galileo galilei aimed his telescope at jupiter and spotted four points of light orbiting the planet for the first time humans had seen the moons of another world in honor of their discoverer these four bodies would become known as the galilean satellites or moons but galileo might have happily traded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs returned by the voyager spacecraft as they flew past these planet sized satellites one of the most remarkable findings of the voyager mission was the presence of active volcanoes on the galilean moon io volcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world other than earth the voyager cameras identified at least nine active volcanoes on io with plumes of ejected material extending as far as kilometers miles above the moon s surface io s pizza colored terrain marked by orange and yellow hues is probably the result of sulfur rich materials brought to the surface by volcanic activity volcanic activity on this satellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the gravitational tug of war between io jupiter and the other three galilean moons europa approximately the same size as our moon is the brightest galilean satellite the moon s surface displays a complex array of streaks indicating the crust has been fractured caught in a gravitational tug of war like io europa has been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt apparently producing a liquid water ocean this ocean is covered by an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the cold of space europa s core is made of rock that sank to its center like europa the other two galilean moons ganymede and callisto are worlds of ice and rock ganymede is the largest satellite in the solar system larger than the planets mercury and pluto the satellite is composed of about percent water or ice and the rest rock ganymede s surface has areas of different brightness indicating that in the past material oozed out of the moon s interior and was deposited at various locations on the surface callisto only slightly smaller than ganymede has the lowest density of any galilean satellite suggesting that large amounts of water are part of its composition callisto is the most heavily cratered object in the solar system no activity during its history has erased old craters except more impacts detailed studies of all the galilean satellites will be performed by the galileo orbiter saturn no planet in the solar system is adorned like saturn its exquisite ring system is unrivaled like jupiter saturn is composed mostly of hydrogen but in contrast to the vivid colors and wild turbulence found in jovian clouds saturn s atmosphere has a more subtle butterscotch hue and its markings are muted by high altitude haze given saturn s somewhat placid looking appearance scientists were surprised at the high velocity equatorial jet stream that blows some kilometers miles per hour three american spacecraft have visited saturn pioneer sped by the planet and its moon titan in september returning the first close up images voyager followed in november sending back breathtaking photographs that revealed for the first time the complexities of saturn s ring system and moons voyager flew by the planet and its moons in august the rings are composed of countless low density particles orbiting individually around saturn s equator at progressive distances from the cloud tops analysis of spacecraft radio waves passing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely in size ranging from dust to house sized boulders the rings are bright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock the rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body ventured too close to saturn the unlucky object would have been torn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its interior or the object may not have been fully formed to begin with and disintegrated under the influence of saturn s gravity a third possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions with larger objects orbiting the planet unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each other individual ring particles appear to be held in place by the gravitational pull of saturn and its satellites these complex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets that make up the major rings radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an am car radio during an electrical storm were detected by the voyager spacecraft these emissions are typical of lightning but are believed to be coming from saturn s ring system rather than its atmosphere where no lightning was observed as they had at jupiter the voyagers saw a version of earth s auroras near saturn s poles the voyagers discovered new moons and found several satellites that share the same orbit we learned that some moons shepherd ring particles maintaining saturn s rings and the gaps in the rings saturn s th moon was discovered in from images taken by voyager in voyager determined that titan has a nitrogen based atmosphere with methane and argon one more like earth s in composition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of mars and venus titan s surface temperature of degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit implies that there might be water ice islands rising above oceans of ethane methane liquid or sludge unfortunately voyager s cameras could not penetrate the moon s dense clouds continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be converting titan s methane to ethane acetylene and in combination with nitrogen hydrogen cyanide the latter compound is a building block of amino acids these conditions may be similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval earth between three and four billion years ago however titan s atmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit progress beyond this stage of organic chemistry the exploration of saturn will continue with the cassini mission the cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will also deploy a probe called huygens which will be dropped into titan s atmosphere and fall to the surface cassini will use the probe as well as radar to peer through titan s clouds and will spend years examining the saturnian system uranus in january four and a half years after visiting saturn voyager completed the first close up survey of the uranian system the brief flyby revealed more information about uranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from ground observations since the planet s discovery over two centuries ago by the english astronomer william herschel uranus third largest of the planets is an oddball of the solar system unlike the other planets with the exception of pluto this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and south poles alternately facing the sun during an year swing around the solar system during voyager s flyby the south pole faced the sun uranus might have been knocked over when an earth sized object collided with it early in the life of the solar system voyager found that uranus magnetic field does not follow the usual north south axis found on the other planets instead the field is tilted degrees and offset from the planet s center a phenomenon that on earth would be like having one magnetic pole in new york city and the other in the city of djakarta on the island of java in indonesia uranus atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen with some percent helium and small amounts of ammonia methane and water vapor the planet s blue color occurs because methane in its atmosphere absorbs all other colors wind speeds range up to kilometers miles per hour and temperatures near the cloud tops average degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit uranus sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of photochemical smog believed to be a combination of acetylene ethane and other sunlight generated chemicals surrounding the planet s atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into space is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as electroglow approximately kilometers miles below uranus cloud tops there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and dissolved ammonia some kilometers miles deep beneath this ocean is an earth sized core of heavier materials voyager discovered new moons kilometers miles in diameter orbiting uranus the five previously known miranda ariel umbriel titania and oberon range in size from to kilometers to miles across representing a geological showcase these five moons are half ice half rock spheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past activity including faulting and ice flows the most remarkable of uranus moons is miranda its surface features high cliffs as well as canyons crater pocked plains and winding valleys the sharp variations in terrain suggest that after the moon formed it was smashed apart by a collision with another body an event not unusual in our solar system which contains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments from large impacts what is extraordinary is that miranda apparently reformed with some of the material that had been in its interior exposed on its surface uranus was thought to have nine dark rings voyager imaged in contrast to saturn s rings which are composed of bright particles uranus rings are primarily made up of dark boulder sized chunks neptune voyager completed its year tour of the solar system with an investigation of neptune and the planet s moons on august the spacecraft swept to within kilometers miles of neptune and then flew on to the moon triton during the neptune encounter it became clear that the planet s atmosphere was more active than uranus voyager observed the great dark spot a circular storm the size of earth in neptune s atmosphere resembling jupiter s great red spot the storm spins counterclockwise and moves westward at almost kilometers miles per hour voyager also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast moving cloud dubbed the scooter as well as high altitude clouds over the main hydrogen and helium cloud deck the highest wind speeds of any planet were observed up to kilometers miles per hour like the other giant planets neptune has a gaseous hydrogen and helium upper layer over a liquid interior the planet s core contains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the other gas giants neptune s distinctive blue appearance like uranus blue color is due to atmospheric methane neptune s magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet s spin axis and is not centered at the core this phenomenon is similar to uranus magnetic field and suggests that the fields of the two giants are being generated in an area above the cores where the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the electrical properties of a metal earth s magnetic field on the other hand is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only slightly tilted and offset relative to its center voyager also shed light on the mystery of neptune s rings observations from earth indicated that there were arcs of material in orbit around the giant planet it was not clear how neptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from spreading out into even unclumped rings voyager detected these arcs but they were in fact part of thin complete rings a number of small moons could explain the arcs but such bodies were not spotted astronomers had identified the neptunian moons triton in and nereid in voyager found six more one of the new moons proteus is actually larger than nereid but since proteus orbits close to neptune it was lost in the planet s glare for observers on earth triton circles neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six days tidal forces on triton are causing it to spiral slowly towards the planet in to million years a short time in astronomical terms the moon will be so close that neptunian gravity will tear it apart forming a spectacular ring to accompany the planet s modest current rings triton s landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of io and miranda the moon has more rock than its counterparts at saturn and uranus triton s mantle is probably composed of water ice but the moon s crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and methane the moon shows two dramatically different types of terrain the so called cantaloupe terrain and a receding ice cap dark streaks appear on the ice cap these streaks are the fallout from geyser like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas and dark fine grained particles to heights of to kilometers to miles triton s thin atmosphere only th as thick as earth s has winds that carry the dark particles and deposit them as streaks on the ice cap the coldest surface yet found in the solar system degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit triton might be more like pluto than any other object spacecraft have so far visited pluto pluto is the most distant of the planets yet the eccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside neptune s orbit where it has been since and where it will remain until march pluto s orbit is also highly inclined tilted degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets discovered in pluto appears to be little more than a celestial snowball the planet s diameter is calculated to be approximately kilometers miles only two thirds the size of our moon ground based observations indicate that pluto s surface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin atmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet moves away from the sun observations also show that pluto s spin axis is tipped by degrees the planet has one known satellite charon discovered in charon s surface composition is different from pluto s the moon appears to be covered with water ice rather than methane ice its orbit is gravitationally locked with pluto so both bodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other pluto s and charon s rotational period and charon s period of revolution are all earth days although no spacecraft have ever visited pluto nasa is currently exploring the possibility of such a mission comets the outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a visit to the inner planets as asteroids are the rocky and metallic remnants of the formation of the solar system comets are the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only far from the sun most comet nuclei reside in the oort cloud a loose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching perhaps halfway to the nearest star comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are gravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close to the sun as a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer planets the volatile elements of which it is made gradually warm by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner planets these volatile elements are boiling the nucleus itself is irregular and only a few miles across and is made principally of water ice with methane and ammonia materials very similar to those composing the moons of the giant planets as these materials boil off of the nucleus they form a coma or cloud like head that can measure tens of thousands of kilometers across the coma grows as the comet gets closer to the sun the stream of charged particles coming from the sun pushes on this cloud blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving rise to the comet s tails gases and ions are blown directly back from the nucleus but dust particles are pushed more slowly as the nucleus continues in its orbit the dust particles are left behind in a curved arc both the gas and dust tails point away from the sun in effect the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the sun the tails can reach million kilometers million miles in length but the total amount of material contained in this dramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase comets from the latin cometa meaning long haired are essentially dramatic light shows some comets pass through the solar system only once but others have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close encounter with one of the giant outer planets these latter visitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return to the inner solar system halley s comet is the most famous example of a relatively short period comet returning on an average of once every years and orbiting from beyond neptune to within venus orbit confirmed sightings of the comet go back to b c this regular visitor to our solar system is named for sir edmond halley because he plotted the comet s orbit and predicted its return based on earlier sightings and newtonian laws of motion his name became part of astronomical lore when in the comet returned on schedule unfortunately sir edmond did not live to see it a comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes comparatively close to earth unfortunately on its most recent appearance halley s comet passed no closer than million kilometers million miles from our world the comet was visible to the naked eye especially for viewers in the southern hemisphere but it was not spectacular comets have been so bright on rare occasions that they were visible during daytime historically comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens and have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky the comet rendezvous asteroid flyby craf spacecraft will become the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and remain in proximity to it as they both approach the sun craf will observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing sunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and form a coma and tails several spacecraft have flown by comets at high speed the first was nasa s international cometary explorer in an armada of five spacecraft two japanese two soviet and the giotto spacecraft from the european space agency flew by halley s comet in conclusion despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of space through an obscuring atmosphere scientists of the past had only one body they could study closely earth but since spaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our neighbors in space we have learned more about our solar system and its members than anyone had in the previous thousands of years our automated spacecraft have traveled to the moon and to all the planets beyond our world except pluto they have observed moons as large as small planets flown by comets and sampled the solar environment astronomy books now include detailed pictures of bodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for generations we are lucky to be alive now to see these strange and beautiful places and objects the knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar system has redefined traditional earth sciences like geology and meteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called comparative planetology by studying the geology of planets moons asteroids and comets and comparing differences and similarities we are learning more about the origin and history of these bodies and the solar system as a whole we are also gaining insight into earth s complex weather systems by seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by investigating the sun s activity and its influence throughout the solar system we can better understand climatic conditions and processes on earth we will continue to learn and benefit as our automated spacecraft explore our neighborhood in space one current mission is mapping venus others are flying between worlds and will reach the sun and jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments future missions are planned for mars saturn a comet and the asteroid belt we can also look forward to the time when humans will once again set foot on an alien world although astronauts have not been back to the moon since december plans are being formulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the human exploration of mars and even the establishment of martian outposts one day taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a lunar base or a martian colony end

re gamma ray bursters where are they i feel compelled to complain the statement that recent observations rule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma ray bursts is utterly false even though it is popular enough to make it to batse press releases the idea behind the statement is as follows if you smack two neutron stars together or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole a lot of energy is released enough for a gamma ray burst at a cosmological distance but so the reasoning continues this energy is released below a lot of matter so the radiation becomes thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum the observed spectra are strongly non thermal so this model must be wrong as so often the fault lies with the imagination of the person who was trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model it may be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma ray burst but the fireball of energy and matter that is created may spew out a relativistic flow when this slams into the surrounding medium a strong flux of non thermal gamma rays results which may carry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy all this is not my idea it is in a series of papers by martin rees peter meszaros sorry for the missing accents and co workers it is certainly not a complete model but it may well be the best one around summing over all proposed distance scales an alternative proposal for what creates the initial fireball by the way is the so called failed supernovae scenario by stan woosley in which a very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black hole if the stellar core was rotating part of the infalling matter will be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal force and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the black hole this beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis which again constitutes relativistic flow the rate of such events may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers but the flux may be more strongly beamed so that the net rate of bursts observed on earth stays the same between the two scenarios but the energy released per event can be a lot less in the failed supernova scenario on another note i do believe that the distance scale must ultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method such as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths or finding a definitive signature of some known class of objects in the distribution of positions and fluxes theorists have historically not been too successfull in finding the distance of any object by proving that there is only one possible way in which the object can work and therefore it must be so and so ralph wijers

re temperature of the dark sky in article apr princeton edu richmond spiff princeton edu stupendous man writes if that s the case let me point out that interstellar dust and molecules provide many instances of things that are well not too far from being blackbodies many different observations including iras and cobe have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures can range from k to k interstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies the large grains have sizes of order micron and absorb visible light with fair efficiency however at temperatures below k of the thermal emission will be beyond microns where radiating efficiency is poor a small antenna cannot easily radiate at long wavelengths thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate the energy they have absorbed moreover the iras observations had a maximum wavelength of microns grains colder than k will radiate primarily at longer wavelengths and iras would be relatively insensitive to them in the extreme limit grains as cold as k will be almost undetectable by any conceivable observation worse still iras color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a population of small grains these grains have only perhaps atoms and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to temperatures of several hundred or k of course they cool quickly and then stay cold for a while but when they are radiating the characteristic temperature is several hundred k even a small population of these grains can dramatically raise the observed average temperature a model for local infrared emission consistent with cobe data has three components these represent scattered radiation from zodiacal dust color temperature k thermal emission from zodiacal dust tc k and thermal emission from galactic dust tc k at the ecliptic poles the emissivities or dilution factors are respectively e e and e the first two are roughly doubled in the ecliptic plane to find the thermal equilibrium temperature we add up the dilution factor times the fourth power of temperature for all components then take the fourth root in the table below starlight comes from allen s number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent to zero mag stars with b v color of no doubt careful work could do much better the person who suggested starlight had a dilution factor of e must have been remembering wrong we would be cooked if that were the case in any event the energy density of starlight comes out about the same as that of the microwave background and i believe that to be correct dilution temp dt microwave background galactic dust e zodiacal dust emission e zodiacal dust scattering e starlight e the fourth root of is k outside the solar system the result would be k i find these results surprising especially the importance of zodiacal dust but i don t see any serious mistakes steve willner phone bitnet willner cfa cambridge ma usa internet willner cfa harvard edu member league for programming freedom contact lpf uunet uu net
re vandalizing the sky in article c agi mju news cso uiuc edu jbh uxa cso uiuc edu josh hopkins writes i m wondering if vandalize is the proper word to use in this situation my dictionary defines vandalism as the willful or malicious destructuion of public or private property especially of anything beautiful or artisitc i would agree the sky is beautiful but not that it is public or private property it s public because it belongs to everybody it s vandalism because many people power companies do maliciously waste light if they can sell you or your city or your state an unshielded light that wastes to percent of its light they make more money never mind that your money is wasted never mind that taxpaper s money is wasted never mind that the sky is ruined bob bunge greed is great gordon grekko

sarsat for tracking payload deployed by tether we are interested in constructing a reentry vehicle to be deployed from a tether attached to an orbiting platform this will be a follow on to our succesful deployment of a kilometer tether on the march flight of seds small expendable deployment system which released an instrumented payload that reentered the earth s atmosphere and burned up over the west coast of mexico this time we want to make a payload that can be recovered we want to build it from off the shelf technology so as to do this as quickly and inexpensively as possible we want to be able to track the payload after it has deployed its parachute an idea we have is to put the same kind of radio beacon on it that is used with sarsats search and rescue satellites it would turn on with the opening of the parachute and aid in tracking these beacons are known in the marine industry as epirbs emergency position indicating radio beacon they are rugged they have to be to survive a ship wreck and cheap we have several questions what is the world authority regulating the use of sarsat beacons are there multiple authorites i e military and civilian what are the regulations regarding the use of sarsat signals can they be used for one of a kind situations with a long lead time of warning the relevant authorities or are they strictly reserved for life threatening emergencies what is the coverage of sarsats are they in leo with only intermittant coverage of a fixed position on the earth or are they in geosynchronous orbit is there an industry organization governing the use and manufacture of these transponders please post replies here or send e mail to me at fennell well sf ca us thanak you very much for any assistance you can provide mike fennell
