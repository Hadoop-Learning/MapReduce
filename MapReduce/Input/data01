re how to mask the left button one way to mask the left button check the contents of the xevent that the xaddeventhandler send to your event handling function in your case it is the show mouse position function if the xevent arrive in this function as xevent p event then the value of p event xbutton button is the button that was pressed so you just do a switch on that value in order to distinguish between them in case it was not clear p event xevent button is an int by the way you mentioned the button motionmask and if anyone can help me with these motionmasks i would be grateful i can not figure out how do distinguish between motions by which button is pressed as the motion is occurring in essence i would like an seperate event handler for motion with each button unfortunately the xevent sent by a motionmask does not seem to contain the value of the pressed button any ideas eps

getting openbugs for motif hello the title just about says it all i need a list of the bugs for motif thanks neal
xmtextfield truncation with lang bug i have found a situation which i think is a bug in x or motif but i m hoping is really just a mistake on my part does anyone know anything about this problem i am using an xmtextfield and setting its xmnvalue to a hardcoded text string ascii or kanji either via xtsetvalues or xmtextsetstring the problem is that when the xmtextfield is displayed the text is getting truncated depending on the setting of the environment variables lang more specifically lc all when they are set to japanese the text gets truncated when they are set to english everything works fine i am taking the default for xmncolumns please note that hardcoding of text is not done in my actual application just in my sample code to make things easier i am running motif x r via hpux my test program is set up to handle bit kanji characters i have remembered to do xtsetlanguageproc prior to my mrminitialize and my font resources are set to japanese fonts don t know if this matters but my dialog box and textfield is initially created with uil the problem does not happen with xmtext unfortunately substituting xmtextfields with xmtexts in my application is not an acceptable alternative way too much code to be modified while in beta i have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone wants it my best guess is that either the x code or motif is not properly allocating memory for japanese but since i don t have the source to look at it is just a guess please let me know if this sounds familiar or if you have a suggestion or if you want the sample program thanks susan swalker bbn com
re xt intrinsics slow popups in article apr alex com bryan alex com bryan boreham writes the shell is waiting for the window manager to respond to its positioning request the window manager is not responding because it thinks the window is already in the right place exactly why the two components get into this sulk is unclear to me all information greatly received this problem is caused by a bad interaction between the way olwm reparents windows a misfeature of the x protocol and a bug in the xt intrinsics the intrinsics bug is that it ignores the x y position given in reparentnotify events olwm is structured in such a way that when a window is popped down the last event the client receives is a reparentnotify event at this point the intrinsics notion of the shell s location is out of date if a setvalues is done using the same x y position the intrinsics thinks it needs to move the shell so it issues a configurewindow request to move it there however a mis feature of the x protocol is that a configurewindow request that has no effect will generate no configurenotify event the intrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive and times out after wmtimeout has expired actually things are somewhat more complex because the request is redirected to the window manager but the net result is the same the solution is for the intrinsics to note the x y positioning information in reparentnotify events this has been implemented and is available in x r public fix this is xbug for those of you who are interested in gorier details s marks stuart w marks stuart marks eng sun com window systems technology garcia ave m s sunsoft inc mountain view ca

re desqview x on a pc and network traffic in article rkloc k picasso cssc syd tansu com au gpatapis boyd tansu com au writes in article qdeck com support qdeck com technical support writes in article qtk rn picasso cssc syd tansu com au gpatapis boyd tansu com au writes what sort of traffic is generated with the x calls i am curious to find out the required bandwidth that a link must have if one machine running dv x is supporting multiple users clients and we require adequate response time anyone have any ideas i expect the limiting factor will be your server machine not the network itself to give you a real world example here at quarterdeck we have roughly people using dvx to talk to a bunch of unix boxes novell file servers and each other it s not too much of a load on our ethernet with maybe concentrators so you have people on each segment if you had a badly loaded net or the apps you wanted to run were very network intensive you could run into some slowdowns but the biggest problem would be the machine itself say you have a with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card if you have people running programs off it you re going to see some slowdowns because you re now on effectively a mhz of course dvx will attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time slice but if you have working programs running you ll know it well i can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the significant drop in price year after year the link i want to use though isdn k is costly and the bandwidth limited that s why my interest lies in seeing if such a link can be used and see what traffic goes through it since i don t think tom always gets time to read this group i ll take the liberty of responding to some of this if you really want tom to reply you should send mail to support qdeck com a k line is certainly going to restrict you far more than the mbps ethernet that we typically run how restrictive it will be depends on what you run and how you run it i would think that a couple of instances of some really nasty program like smoking clover would make the link useless for anyone else on the other hand probably xclocks quietly updating every seconds or so wouldn t impact it too much in the real world you will be somewhere in between these two extremes going by the way i personally use x on a daily basis i wouldn t want to have to share that k link with more than other people having said that if you can tweak the programs being run by adding in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of thing you could probably run people on a given machine before you started seeing slowdowns again this time from network bandwidth hmmm has anyone at your centre monitored the traffic at all are you running any standard ms windows programs like word what sort of packets go blazing through what size link do you have mb or mb what is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you have few high peaks and then many low points our corporate wan is as unique as any other the usage patterns are not very good predictors of how yours will behave the only one of our low bandwidth links that normally get used in this way is a k link to ireland that they often use to run a dos text based client end of a client server database remotely from the dvx machine behind me since the server end is or was always at this end california it is faster to remotely run the client via desqview x and have a short hop to the server than running the client locally and having a long hop to the server as i warned you this tells us very little about how you usage pattern will fill a k isdn link running word for windows remotely is going to itself be very usage dependent let s break it into pieces and look at it tracking the mouse pointer is easy and efficient to translate from windows calls into x popping up a menu is a little more involved and will generate some traffic restoring the screen that was covered by that menu may be easy and may not be does the server that it s displaying on have backing store if so and the server had enough memory the display can be updated locally and will generate little network traffic if no backing store then what was being covered up if it was a solid colored rectangle of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quite easily if it was a full color backdrop of ren stimpy we may have to send it back to the x server bit by bit dvx will do its level best to only redraw that small area but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be repainted assuning a x screen with bits per pixel that s bits that has to be sent worst possible case you re looking at about seconds in reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts that will be tranlatable into higher level x calls it all really depends on what the programs are doing ie you re going to see a slowdown from x bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all doing network things also what do you mean by network things i vision using ms windows and other windows applications over the network were the processes are running on the server and all i am getting are the displays i am wondering how good is the x and subsequently dv x protocol in transferring these images with x calls and displaying them on a client s machine x was designed from the ground up to be efficient across a network it s pretty good for this x programs are best dos text programs are almost as good since we conert them to x easily something like winx is a hybrid we intercept the calls windows makes to it s graphics driver mouse driver keyboard driver and convert them to x the calls windows is making are in no way designed to be efficient on a packet switched network we go to a lot of trouble to convert them to the highes level xlib calls we can but we are somewhat limited because we only know what windows and its applications tell us quarterdeck office systems gary rich problem

efficient pc clients we re looking at various x clients for pc s and we re looking for some information about the relative efficiency of different products are any notably efficient fast are any notably inefficient i assume that a graphics accelerator makes them significantly faster right now i m looking at ico running on xoftware for windows sitting on the distinct tcp ip platform and it s not surprisingly much slower than ico running on the sparc s console what are the key ways of improving performance for pc presumably windows clients also what about async solutions yes i appreciate that it will be much slower even with v bis i m in the process of installing ppp with header compression how does that compare to cslip i ve seen a product called xremote by ncd that promises to be pretty efficient but are there comparable products out there if we re looking for efficiency for async pc clients what should we be looking at in addition to standard ppp w compression and xremote any information would be greatly appreciated i m still taking in all the information in the faq but any tips about the relative efficiency of various product offerings would be great i get the impression that discussions about speed are largely application specific but that not withstanding any comments would be appreciated thanks rob rob ryan system constructs inc rryan panix com

none we are adding a motif wrapper to a family of data display programs these programs are each written as a main loop with these steps use semop to check a semaphore and if true access new data otherwise block new data comes quite often use msgop to check for messages and if true read them otherwise continue messages are user commands and not often update the display according to latest data and messages we typically have several of these running in windows plus a data producer serving some device and setting the flag everyone blocking makes sure the device server gets to run xt and xm also have a main loop model that we must fit into o reilly vol iv ch discusses adding a file watcher and also how to add workprocs that are run during idle time we can open up our existing main loop and call it as a workproc the problem is our blocking until new data is no longer appropriate neither is letting the program free run because others are hurt the unix select call lets you block until any of several i o are ready we want that for the x main loop except not file i o any suggestions or examples most welcome we run sgi personal iris and indigo systems morris hirsch aka morris sg nusc navy mil or

re keyboard mapping and window placement questions in article apr news mentorg com darcym fpddet mentorg com darcy mccallum writes these are two common subjects so i hope someone has had to deal with these specific questions question deleted i would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right of my main window i want it at the same y coord and their right left sides touching what i need to ask for is the x y coord of the window manager s border for the main window this should ring a bell with anyone who has called xtmovewidget immediately checking the x y after the move and seeing that it is right and in their next callback asking for the x y and seeing that it is now offset by the wm border any help would be most appreciated darcy darcy mccallum mentorg com i have done this before but i m not sure i used the best approach although i tried several methods you have to run up the window heirarchy using xquerytree until you get to the root window now this is not so simple because some window managers slap a window over the root window that is the same size as the root window so be sure to take that into account for further calculations calculate the position and width height offsets for each window using xgetgeometry be sure to take the border width into consideration remember a windows border width is on the outside of a window so the windows x y width height must be adjusted accordingly all of this should give you pretty good numbers for how much space the window manager is using now to place the new window you have to use the same numbers to calculate where you want to place it because the window manager will re parent it on the outside of where you place your window if i remember correctly disclaimer all of this is from memory and i no longer have the code but i did get it working under several window managers correctly feel free to call or e mail for further info mcgary mike d mcgary voice intellection fax lbj freeway suite arpa mcgary intellection com dallas texas uucp intellection com mcgary cs utexas edu
x server only on sun i have been using a hds x terminal and really like it what is really powerful is that it can run the x server without running a window manager one can then run a special client x program called a window manager either run motif or openlook from it s own firmware limiting the network traffic but having no home or run motif or openlook from some home place like a sparc or vms this is powerful especially since i can exit one window manager without killing windows and then start up another manager some of my vms tools need special meta mouse combos that work in one manager and not the other well the question is on a sparcstation running openlook does anyone know how to break apart olwm from the olwm slave program basically i want to run only the server and go somewhere else to run the window manager please respond my e mail as well as posting because of the large volumes in window x thanks scott moody there are no answers just cross references scott shuksan boeing com uunet bcstec shuksan scott
re desqview x over tcp ip how reliable how is it implemented in article c bflb kem cs columbia edu ethan cs columbia edu ethan solomita writes three q s is it reliable i use it all day every day maintaining our ftp site and answering mail via support qdeck com and i can honestly say that in the last few months i ve never had my machine go down due to any sort of tcpip network manager instability of course i ve crashed my machine quite a few times on purpose during beta testing and that sort of thing but the tcpip portion is quite stable however keep in mind that dvx and the network managers are only going to be as stable as the software they sit on top of so if your underlying network kernel is flakey you can t expect dvx to be terribly stable how does it send the information from a ms windows app over the x protocol does it just draw everything as graphics into one window or does it use multiple windows and essentially work more cleverly it just goes as a window that has graphics drawn into it to vastly over simplify what goes on we just take the windows graphics api calls and translate them directly to x protocol unfortunately windows was not really written to be network aware so sometimes we see a speed penalty when an app does something stupid like sending a big white bitmap to erase something rather than just drawing a white box fortunately that sort of thing is rare if i want to run ms word for example remotely do i have to run a separate copy of ms windows remotely and then start ms word from that or can ms word be started remotely on its own you need to run ms windows which word then runs inside you could run multiple windows programs within the one winx window and windows has ways to automagically start winapps when you start windows so in practice it s not really a major problem i have my system set up so that i can run winx which automatically starts word full screen for windows so i never see any part of windows but word quarterdeck office systems internet support tom bortels pricing ordering info qdeck com tech questions support qdeck com bbs fax compuserve go quarterdeck anonymous ftp qdeck com leave your email address as password

resolution bitmapped fonts device independence i recently corrected the resolution on my sparcstation by changing usr lib x xdm xservers from local usr bin x x ar dpi to local usr bin x x ar dpi i determined that my x monitor was dpi by measuring the active screen area and dividing by resolution however this has caused my application fonts to behave strangely after some research i believe this is caused by my applications requesting fonts by family weight slant and pointsize i believe that x is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics and displaying it since i have only dpi and dpi fonts on my path the results are inaccurate i do have some speedo fonts but not for the family i am using helvetica i think this is incorrect the fonts should always be provided in the resolution of the display this never seems to happen unless you explicitly request fonts by xres and yres this is true of both the scaleable and bitmapped fonts for instance the command xfd fn bitstream charter will invoke a dpi font despite the fact that this is a speedo font the command xfd fn adobe courier will invoke a dpi font or a dpi font depending on my font path despite the fact that x knows my display is dpi and that it can generate an dpi font for me unless i my applications specifies a resolution x appears to pick a stupid default is this a bug is it a feature if so why is there anything i can do to get around this problem people have suggested that i lie about my resolution and specify a single font path or not both this would at least make my app consistent but i like being able to look at rulers that appear in my paint application and say yup thats an inch anyone have a set of dpi bitmapped fonts i can use system info sun sparc w mb sunos xdpyinfo version number vendor string mit x consortium vendor release number screen dimensions x pixels x millimeters resolution x dots per inch xset q font path usr lib x fonts misc usr lib x fonts speedo usr lib x fonts dpi usr lib x fonts dpi thanks rbroders oracle com bob brodersen applications architect applications technology group applications division oracle corporation redwood shores ca

re xv has escaped given that all the source code contains explicit permission to use or modify the code without fee in addition to the shareware notice i would say that the shareware notice is unenforceable all you need to do is make minor changes to create a derivative work which is explicitly allowed under the first part of the copyright notice of course this would be circumventing the author s wishes on the subject but i d say if you re not going to pay him no matter what you d be on relatively safe ground with that approach in fact given the internal contradictions of the copyright notices i d guess none of it could ever be enforced but not being a lawyer i can t be positive regardless the fees he s asking are not excessive and i would encourage anyone who wants to use the program to pay them if at all possible even though it is unlikely that you have actual legal obligations to pay the author it would be reasonable to do so to support his efforts if nothing else brad brad daniels if money can t buy happiness daniels neosoft com i guess i ll have to rent it i don t work for neosoft and weird al yenkovic don t speak for my employer
re xv has escaped in article sophia inria fr muller mafalda inria fr christophe muller writes anyway at simulog we will abandon xv we were using it mostly for slide shows because of its loop feature that display does not have display from the wonderful imagemagick package d but i think i will implement it myself even a shell script should do the job and forget xv xli and xloadimage have a goto flag graeme gill

questions about x on intel based unix with answers i what options do i have for x software on my intel based unix system free options the best option is xfree which is an enhanced version of x any other version of x will have slower performance and will be more difficult to compile information on how to obtain xfree is listed below x is the port of the x server to system v that was done by thomas roell roell sgcs com it supports a wide variety of svga boards there are major free versions x is based on x r x is included in mit s x r distribution ie you don t need to patch it into the mit

r or greater hw works with any vesa compliant video note other commercial vendors including os vendors describing bundled software are welcome to submit summary information summary information such as the above ii what is xfree and where do i get it what is xfree xfree is an enhanced version of x which was distributed with x r this release consists of many bug fixes speed improvements and other enhancements here are the highlights of the enhancements the speedup package from glenn lai is an integral part of xfree selectable at run time via the xconfig file some speedups require an et based svga and others require a virtual screen width of the speedups suitable to the configuration are selected by default with a high quality et board vram this can yield up to improvement of the xstones benchmark over x the fx packages from jim tsillas are included as the default operating mode if speedup is not selected this mode is now equivalent in performance to x b x r and approximately faster than x support for localconn compile time selectable for server clients or both this support is for both svr and svr for svr with the advanced compatibility package local connections from sco xsight odt clients are supported drivers for ati and trident tvga c and tvga svga chipsets refer to the files readme ati and readme trident for details about the ati and trident drivers support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added thomas eberhardt s code from the contrib directory on export lcs mit edu type font code from mit contrib tape has been included and is compile time selectable there are contributed type fonts in the contrib directory on export lcs mit edu new configuration method which allows the server s drivers and font renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary distributions integrated support for bsd mach and linux a monochrome version of the server which will run on generic vga cards is now included the following key features were added with the release of xfree they were not in xfree the monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank switching of available svga memory to allow virtual screens up to x see the x manual page for more information support for the hercules mono card has been added to the monochrome server and with it the ability to support a two headed server one vga and one hercules so far this has only been tested on svr it is also reported to work under linux svr shared libraries tested under isc svr and support for svr there are some special considerations to consider due to new usl bugs see the readme svr file for more information support for ps mice and logitech mouseman trackman some versions of these devices were not previously compatible a new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor timing data written by eric raymond derived from previous documentation and a lot of experimentation greatly improved support for international keyboards including implementation of the compose key functionality found on many vendor servers see the x keybd manual page for more information the accuracy with which the server detects svga pixel clocks has been improved and the timings are now stored at accuracies of mhz users may want to consider removing an existing clocks line from their xconfig file and re probing using the new server many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the xconfig configuration file error messages are much more informative and intuitive and more validation is done there are many new options that can be enabled in the xconfig file see the x manual page for more information on the format of this file plus a number of other small things refer to the changelog file in the source distribution for full details also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by eric raymond and the current x mode database and a sample xdm configuration by david wexelblat what oss are supported xfree supports svr consensys v svr microport dell esix isc at t mst consensys uhc svr isc at t linux mach bsd bsd is not supported but it should work the most active bsd person is greg lehey grog lemis de note that esix d and sco are not supported yet but anyone should feel free to submit patches if you are interested in tackling this send mail to xfree physics su oz au what video hardware is supported at this time xfree supports the following svga chipsets tseng et tseng et paradise pvga western digital wd c wd c wd c these are supersets of the pvga and use its driver genoa gvga trident tvga c tvga ati all of the above are supported in both color and monochrome modes with the exception of the ati chipsets which are only supported in color mode the monochrome server also supports generic vga cards using k of video memory in a single bank and the hercules card on the et only k of video memory is supported for the monochrome server and the gvga has not been tested with more than k it appears that some of the svga card manufacturers are going to non traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel clock frequencies to avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes xfree adds support for using an external program to select the pixel clock this allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are discovered refer to the readme clkprog file for information on how these programs work if you need to write one if you do develop such a program the xfree team would be interested in including it with future xfree releases if you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using xfree it is suggested that you purchase an et based board such as the orchid prodesigner iis avoid recent diamond boards xfree will not work with them because diamond won t provide programming details in fact the xfree project is actively not supporting new diamond products as long as such policies remain in effect contributions of code will not be accepted because of the potential liabilities if you would like to see this change tell diamond about it some people have asked if xfree would work with local bus or eisa video cards theoretically the means of communication between the cpu and the video card is irrelevant to xfree compatibility it could be isa eisa or local bus what should matter is the chipset on the video card unfortunately the developers don t have a lot of access to eisa or vlb machines so this is largely an untested theory however we have yet to see any reports of things not working on one of these buses and we have several reports of xfree working fine on them what about accelerated boards at this time there is no support in xfree for accelerated boards like the s ati ultra a tiga etc this support is available in commercial products from sgcs and metrolink for svr and svr an s server is available for bsd and linux contact hasty netcom com for bsd or jon robots ox ac uk for linux a beta a server is available for linux contact martin cs unc edu or jon robots ox ac uk note these servers are not part of xfree why doesn t xfree support color vga modes the reason that this is not supported is the way vga implements the color modes in color modes each byte of frame buffer memory contains pixel but the color modes are implemented as bit planes each byte of frame buffer memory contains bit from each of each of pixels and there are four such planes the mit frame buffer code is not designed to deal with this if vga handled color modes by packing bit pixels into each byte the mit code could be modified to support this or it already may i m not sure but for the vga way of doing things a complete new frame buffer implementation is required some beta testers are looking into this but nothing is yet available from the project what other hardware or software requirements are there obviously a supported svga board and os are required to run x efficiently mb of memory should be considered a minimum the various binary releases take mb of disk space depending on the os e g whether or not it supports shared libraries to build from sources at least mb of free disk space will be required although mb should be considered a comfortable lower bound where can i get source for xfree source patches for the current version based on x r pl from mit are available via anonymous ftp from export lcs mit edu under contrib xfree ftp physics su oz au under xfree ftp win tue nl under pub xfree for the rest of this faq these location will be called ftp refer to the readme file under the specified directory for information on which files you need to get to build your distribution where can i get binaries for xfree binaries are available via anonymous ftp from ftp physics su oz au svr binaries under xfree svr ftp win tue nl svr binaries under pub xfree svr ferkel ucsb edu svr

mit edu linux binaries under pub linux packages x agate berkeley edu bsd binaries under pub bsd ports xfree ftp cs uwm edu mach binaries under i ensure that you are getting xfree some of these sites may archive older releases as well each binary distribution will contain a readme file that describes what files you need to take from the archive and which compile time option selections were made when building the distribution iv what general things should i know about running xfree installation directories the top level installation directory is specified by the projectroot usr x by default variable in config site def binaries include files and libraries are installed in projectroot bin include lib this can be changed when rebuilding from sources and can be modified via symbolic links for those oss that support them this directory is nonstandard and was chosen this way to allow xfree to be installed alongside a commercial vendor supplied x implementation configuration files the xfree server reads a configuration file xconfig on startup the search path contents and syntax for this file are documented in the server manpage which should be consulted before asking questions determining vga dot clocks and monitor modes david e wexelblat dwex mtgzfs att com maintains a database of known clock settings for vga cards and monitor settings the database is installed in usr x lib x etc modedb txt and is in the source tree under mit server ddx x etc this database is also available from him for the latest copy and is kept on export lcs mit edu in contrib x modedb z which is updated occasionally obtain a copy of this database it just might have the settings you need if you create new settings please send them to david for inclusion in the database if this doesn t help you the videomodes doc by eric raymond file with xfree contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings it may be helpful to start with settings that almost work and use this description to get them right when you do send the information to david wexelblat for inclusion in the database note the old clock exe program is not supported any more and is completely unnecessary if you need to determine dot clock values for a new board remove the clocks line from your xconfig file if present and start the server the server will probe for clocks itself and print them out you can use these values to put a clocks line into your xconfig file which is not necessary but will speed up starting the server in the future rebuilding reconfiguring the server from the link kit if you have installed the server binary link kit it is possible to reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server this is fully explained in the readme file that is available with the link kit v what os specific things should i know about running xfree first of all the server must be installed suid root mode svr why won t my xterm run properly if your kernel is not built with the consem module you should define consem no in you environment otherwise xterm won t run csh users should use setenv consem no the esix console driver patch is known to cause keymapping problems with xfree it recommended that this patch not be installed alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap svr make sure you look at ftp readme isc if that s what you are running bsd make sure you look at ftp readme bsd also a separate bsd faq is maintained by richard murphey rich rice edu the latest version should be available in the file xfree bsd faq at the following ftp sites agate berkeley edu pub bsd ports xfree wuarchive wustl edu mirrors bsd ports xfree grasp univ lyon fr pub bsd ports xfree linux you must be running linux pl or greater and have the gcc jump libraries installed make sure the binaries x x mono xload and xterm are setuid root if your kernel doesn t have tcp support compiled in you ll have to run the server as x pn the default startup configuration assumes that tcp is not available if it is change the two files usr x bin startx and usr x lib x xdm xservers removing the pn argument to x make sure dev console is either a link to dev tty or has the major number minor number also note that if dev console is not owned by the user running x then xconsole and xterm will not permit console output redirection xdm will properly change the owner but startx won t when running xdm from rc local you will need to provide it with a tty for example xdm dev console for more detailed information please read the file readme present with the distribution on tsx mit edu mach make sure you look at ftp readme mach vi what things should i know for building xfree from source this section has been removed from the faq since it is fully explained in ftp readme and the os specific readmes please look at those files for information on building xfree vii is there anything special about building clients with xfree bsd compatibility library a lot of clients make use of bsd functions like bcopy etc the default configuration files are set up to link with libxbsd a which contains emulation for bcopy bzero bcmp ffs random seed a better way of providing the b functions is to include x xfuncs h in source files that call them xfuncs h provides macro definitions for these in terms of the sysv mem functions if you are linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these functions then you should link with libxbsd a ansiccoptions this is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the ansi ness defined in the default ccoptions without having to rewrite the entire ccoptions line for example with stock mit you d see something like ccoptions ansi o fwritable strings and to get rid of the ansi ness the developer would have to put ccoptions o fwritable strings in his imakefile with this change you would see a default of ansiccoptions ansi ccoptions o fwritable strings and all the developer would have to put in the imakefile is ansiccoptions to get rid of the ansi ness many x clients will die a horrible death with ansi the effect is even more dramatic in practice because ccoptions is actually quite complex the other issue is that one must add ansiccoptions ansiccoptions to a passcdebugflags definition xfree contact information ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the xfree core team at this time the core team consists

looking in the appropriate manuals listed in the bibliography below before posting to the comp windows open look comp windows x or alt toolkits xview newsgroups and or their corresponding mailing lists special notes i have not updated this faq for the recently announced openwindows due to ship later this year yes sun is moving to motif along with all of cose but the motif to which they move will be a new motif with some of the open look ui features added yes openwindows will use dps instead of news news is dead this means tnt is dead too xview and olit will be supported but probably not enhanced after the next release i don t know if there will be a source release of xview or not the cose environment will include at least some of sun s deskset ported to motif look for calendar

revision history recent changes subject terminology open look openwindows x xview olit moolit motif what is open look open look is a specification of a graphical user interface gui a gui determines the look and feel of a system the shape of windows buttons and scroll bars how you resize things how you edit files etc the open look gui is specified developed and maintained jointly by sun microsystems and at t or usl see also bibliography what is openwindows openwindows is a windowing environment that conforms to the open look graphical user interface specifications it s compatible with the x window system from mit as well as currently sun s news and sunview so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems it comes from sun and also with system v release from certain vendors openwindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews after the program used to start it and the main executable itself respectively it should not be called windows or open look or openlook as these terms are either wrong or apply to something else a commerical openwindows source licence costs about for the server plus about for deskset and another for tooltalk the current versions of openwindows for various platforms are sunos on sun solaris x sunos x on sparc solaris sunos on sparc see also mixing x and openwindows where can i get it what are olit xview and tnt these are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs that conform to the open look specifications see the bibliography for documentation on the individual toolkits here s a brief summary olit was at t s open look intrinsics toolkit for the x window system it used a widget set and was probably the easiest for people who were already x xt programmers to learn you could buy the source from at t although you didn t get the same version tht sun ship sun includes the olit library in openwindows q v it is also often included in system v release it was written in c the release of olit in openwindows was olit olit support passed to usl then a division of at t now owned by novell who replaced it with moolit q v note that because of the nature of xt subclassing you will probably want or need olit source in order to develop a large application or anything else that uses subclasses see the proceedings of the x technical conference xview is sun s toolkit for x written in c xview is similar in programmer interface to sunview there s even a shell script to help migrate source code from sunview to xview xview is often said to be the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with x windows the xview toolkit is included in openwindows and full source is available by anonymous ftp from export lcs mit edu and elsewhere the current version of xview from sun is despite rumours to the contrary some even from within sun the xview toolkit is not about to be dropped by sun xview will be included in the next release of openwindows unlike news on the other hand the xview toolkit is not likely to receive as much attention from sun in the future as olit the news toolkit tnt was an object oriented programming system based on the postscript language and news tnt implements many of the open look interface components required to build the user interface of an application it s currently included in openwindows the current version of tnt from sun is release contains some incompatibilities with tnt and tnt but sun are committed to supporting the api at least until they stop news support some time later this year and replace it with display postscript wail you might ask what is committed to means in this context the answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing sun currently asserts that it is committed to olit however the c user interface toolkit uit consists of an object oriented c class library layered on top of xview and a tool to generate code from devguide gil files the uit also includes features that simplify event management and the use of postscript and color it is said to be compatible with openwindows v and v and presumably v since the release mentions that it works on solaris uit is not an official sun supported product but an ongoing project of various people within sun it can be found on export lcs mit edu in the mit contrib directory as uitv tar z use binary mode where does motif fit in it doesn t motif is an alternative graphical user interface that is being developed by osf it has a look and feel reminiscent of microsoft windows and the os presentation manager there are no non commercial motif toolkits available although the motif source is sold reasonably cheaply by osf although motif is currently available on more platforms than openwindows the open look gui is almost certainly used on many more machines simply because sun and sysvr have such a large installed base sun s cd ware volume contains a roadmap for improving motif applications by converting them to olit there are also notes in the periodic table olit demo openwinhome demo olittable what is moolit moolit is a version of olit from at t usl that lets users choose between a motif and an open look ui feel at run time it will be part of system v release contact joanne newbauer jo usl com what about that display postscript thing sun and adobe have agreed that sun will include the dps extension to x in the next release of openwindows dps is essentially a badly designed hack on top of a slow level postscript interpreter intended to give a very small subset of the functionality of news whilst simultaneously being harder to use as i understand it the only real advantage it has over news is that the manual is much smaller being generally less complete dps is also available on more kinds of machine performance on our rs is not suitable for interactive work what it will be like on the sparcstation remains to be seen note that whereas x news fonts are shared by both subsystems the dps extension to x does not make type postscript fonts available to ordinary x programs it is not like atm on a pc in this regard there is at least one third party version which does make fonts available however subject window managers olwm olvwm what are olwm and olvwm they are window managers a window manager is the part of the x window system e g x that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows on the screen and for managing the user s interaction with the windows olwm is the standard open look window manager it s included with all of the openwindows q v implementations and you can also get the source by ftp since sun donated it olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a virtual desktop hence the v in its name it shows a little map on the screen with the currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle you can move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys this lets you run several clients applications and move the display around from one to the other olvwm was derived from the openwindows olwm by scott oaks you need to have xview to compile it get olvwm from an ftp site such as export lcs mit edu in the contrib directory there are three patches can i use my favorite window manager with openwindows instead of olwm yes if you use twm for example or mwm you won t be able to use the pin and unpin feature of olwm and you probably won t see the footers some windows use to display certain messages if you use twm you ll want to use the f delete function to unpin menus and get rid of programs that don t have a quit button when not run under olwm for twm put this in your home twmrc lefttitlebutton target f delete where target is a x icon from usr include x bitmaps alternatively try add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm lefttitlebutton menu f menu ol menu menu ol menu quit f delete for mwm you can double click on the menu icon on the left of the title bar to dismiss a pop up window i am told see the manual page for your window manager twm etc subject openwindows terminals and other displays can i use olwm and olvwm without openwindows or on an x terminal the openwindows xnews server combines sunview news postscript and x this means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems unfortunately it means that some openwindows programs need either news or sunview support and thus won t run on an x terminal this includes pageview in particular you can use olwm or olvwm see above on an x terminal or a non open windows display and most open look clients e g olit or xview ones will work perfectly well you may find that you get complaints about fonts not being found if so see the fonts section below if you are running the window manager built in to an ncd terminal you may have problems with input focus setting input true in the terminal s xdefault file in usr lib x xdm may or may not help subject configuration files getting started with openwindows what configuration files do i need to know about xinitrc and xsessionrc the first time you run openwindows a xinitrc file will be created in your login directory home if it already exists you might have to edit it somewhat it s simplest to move it and any other old x files you have to another directory and then merge the old and new files if your site uses xdm you should use xsession instead of xinitrc since xdm doesn t look at your xinitrc file openwin init openwin menu and openwin sys these are optional files you can create in your home directory depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use look in openwinhome lib normally usr openwin lib for these files without the leading and copy any you want to change you may need to edit your xinitrc to get them recognized if you are not on an x terminal you will want to run a console window such as cmdtool c shelltool c xterm c or chuck musciano s contool program so that system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen note that openwin sys is not executed unless you edit xinitrc xdefaults you can put x windows resource specifications in here in particular it is a good idea to include at least openwindows focuslenience true input true these allow non icccm compliant programs to receive input even if they forget to ask for it props the program that runs when you select properties from the default root menu under olwm or olvwm writes your choices into xdefaults don t put comments in xdefaults since props deletes them startup ps this is the news user profile file read by openwindows actually xnews on startup this is documented in the news programming manual near the back the most useful thing to put here is postscript code to change the keyboard repeat rate although you must be very careful since a syntax error in the postscript means that xnews will either not start up at all or will get broken in strange ways the news manual gives code that is both incorrect and insufficient warning things in this file rarely work on both openwindows and note that the mouse speed is best set in your xinitrc with xset m see the man page for xset man xset and xset help for more information here s what home startup ps should look like if you want a delay of about a third of a second microseconds and a repeat rate of twenty or so keys per second microseconds between repeats for openwindows you ll have to experiment a bit because the repeattime is the delay between keys sent and thus doesn t include the time to process each key which is probably higher on my than on your supersparc gti injection again this is for openwindows don t want the demos see p xxxii of news toolkit reference manual includedemos false def userprofile begin keyrepeatthresh timeval storetimeval def keyrepeattime timeval storetimeval def note and differ greatly end you must also have a user ps file in the same directory like this news findpackage beginpackage tntcore findpackage beginpackage tnt findpackage beginpackage classrepeatkeys pop force repeat ps to autoload endpackage endpackage endpackage if you change these parameters you can test them without restarting the openwindows server like this psh i startup ps welcome to x news version psh i welcome to x news version classinit classrepeatkeys send now press control d you can also either of these two files startup ps and user ps to make the root window be retained so that a postscript drawing on the background won t be erased when you move windows frambuffer retained true put will do this note that this may increase the amount of memory used by the news server xnews dramatically see also trouble shooting it won t let me type trouble shooting is there an easy way to edit xdefaults environment variables how can i configure open look for a left handed mouse and keyboard you can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons but be prepared for one or two occasional surprises see also man xview for a list of keybindings you can change at least for xview programs with openwindows you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings and then let sunview handle them the status returned by svenv should tell you whether your server is running under sunview or not put this in your xinitrc if eval svenv env then xmodmap e pointer input from defaults else xmodmap e pointer fi how can i get the screen to go blank when the system is idle run screenblank from etc rc local if you can it s a boring but effective screen saver see man screenblank under solaris you ll need to copy screenblank from an older system as it s not supplied then add a new file in etc rc d to make the system run screenblank automatically subject key bindings cut and paste how do i cut and paste between xterm and openwindows programs to go from xterm to textedit say select the text you want to copy by dragging the select mouse button in xterm press copy in the xterm this key is l or meta c the o reilly xview manual gets this wrong move to the textedit window and press paste l or meta v if this doesn t work see trouble shooting cut and paste to go the other way from textedit to xterm select the text in textedit no need to use copy move to the xterm window and press adjust the middle mouse button you can also use the copy cut and paste buttons copy paste is boring what short cuts are available quick copy within textedit mailtool etc click select to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go press and hold down the paste or cut button select the text you want to copy move you ll see that it s underlined or crossed out as appropriate in the jed demo it goes grey let go of the paste or cut button the text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret drag and drop to move a selection select the text you want to copy or move by dragging or multiple clicking the select or adjust mouse button put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection press and hold down down the select mouse button and move the mouse pointer a little to the right you ll see the cursor changes to be the first letters of the text or some other icon still holding select down move the mouse over the point where you want to drop the text you may see the mouse pointer change to a rifle sight or target to show that it s ok to drop things here let go of select and the text is moved this works in text fields of dialogue boxes as well as in text subwindows drag and drop to copy a selection this is the same as using drag and drop to move a selection except that you must hold the control key down as well as the select mouse button what are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere see the man page for textedit for some of them in general the editing moving commands go in the opposite direction when shifted e g ctrl w deletes a word and ctrl w deletes the word to the right of the

you might need to change to home now pressing r will insert your signature file subject fonts does openwindows support type postscript fonts yes under either solaris or i m not sure which or not yet in other words if you have framemaker there is a utility to import them i m told the fonts supplied with openwindows are fully hinted though and comparing them to the microsoft windows and apple truetype fonts is interesting the f font format is described in a publication from the sun openfonts group listed in the bibliography below documentation on the unbundled version of typescaler is also available from sun openfonts you can buy f fonts from sunpics monotype linotype urw and probably other major foundries sunpics newsprint software supports type fonts improving font rendering time although the sun type renderer typescaler is pretty fast it s not as fast as loading a bitmap you can pre generate bitmap fonts for sizes that you use a lot and you can also alter and access the font cache parameters if you have a lot of memory you might want to increase the font cache size psh i welcome to x news version psh will say this at you currentfontmem type this line and here s whai my server was using kbytes setfontmem just to check currentfontmem see pp ff of the news programmer s guide you need to say psh i so that the postscript packages are loaded see the psh man page making

can also use folio fonts with an x server by converting them to a bitmap x bdf format first your licence forbids you from using the fonts on another machine and unless you have newsprint you shouldn t use them for printing having said all that you can use makeafb and convertfont to generate bdf files that you can compile with bdftosnf or bdftopcf use mftobdf from the seetex distribution to convert tex pk fonts to x bdf format which you can then use with either x or oenwindows you can also use der mouse s getbdf to get bdf fonts from a running x display server ftp larry mcrcim mcgill edu x getbdf xview olit fonts at dpi there aren t any more precisely the various text fonts such as lucida typewriter sans are available at dpi and in fact are scalable under openwindows the glyph fonts are bitmaps and don t scale very well subject trouble shooting strange error messages no manual entry for cm lookup if man doesn t seem to find openwindows commands even though you are running openwindows

most systems window window creation failed to get new fd window base frame not passed parent window in environment cannot create base frame process aborted these messages all come from sunview programs sunview was an earlier windowing system for suns and was not networked some of the sunview programs are still around in usr bin and have names that are the same as their openwindows counterparts you almost certainly want to run the programs in openwinhome instead set your path so that openwinhome bin and openwin bin xview for openwindows come before bin or usr bin they re the same or you ll get the sunview versions of mailtool cmdtool shelltool etc memory fault core dumped if you get this from the binder or if binder vanishes suddenly get the following patches binder cetables tooltalk trouble compiling xt xmu or olit programs get wmshellwidgetclass if you are using openwindows x r based xt contact your local sun office and request the following patches x openwindows libxt jumbo patch x openwindows undefined symbols when using shared libxmu if you can t install the patch a workaround is to add u get wmshellwidgetclass u get applicationshellwidgetclass on the link ld or cc o line an alternative is to add assert nodefinitions to cflags in your makefile or even in imake tmpl subject trouble shooting it won t let me type when i try to type into some programs i just get beeps or nothing happens it is a good idea to include at least openwindows focuslenience true input true in your xdefaults file as these allow non icccm compliant programs to receive input even if they forget to ask for it see the next item for editing xdefaults subject trouble shooting cut and paste not working i can t paste from xterm to xview including sun deskset programs under openwindows you need to add the following either to your home xdefaults file or to openwinhome lib app defaults xterm instead xterm vt translations override key l select set clipboard n key l insert selection clipboard you must not move the mouse between ending the selection and pressing l the paste key under openwindows this is already in the app defaults file so if it isn t working check that xfilesearchpath is set to usr openwin lib t n s and if it isn t either set it or copy merge the above lines from openwinhome lib app defaults xterm into usr lib x app defaults xterm see also environment variables this version automatically puts each xterm selection onto the clipboard xterm vt translations override n ctrl meta btn up insert selection primary cut buffer n ctrl meta btnup select end primary cut buffer clipboard n keypress l insert selection clipboard note be sure that the n is at the very end of the line there must be no following spaces and any or signs showing that this faq file was altered must also be removed if you are using x r you may find that adding the lines key l start extend select end primary clipboard cut buffer n keyrelease l kill selection n before the keypress l line will make l cut work as a cut key if you alter home xdefaults instead you must use what x calls a more specific resource name xterm vt translations will do i can t paste from xview including sun deskset programs to xterm if you don t have the sun l keys on the left of your keyboard you can use meta x meta c and meta v for cut coy and paste respectively you can change the keys by adding the following two lines to your xdefaults file edited as you wish the values shown here are the defaults openwindows keyboardcommand copy c meta l openwindows keyboardcommand paste v meta l lists of resources are in the manual page for xview and also in the thinnish blue book companion to volume xview reference manual from o reilly and also in the olwm and olvwm manual pages i always get the same piece of text when i press paste l meta v remove the file tmp textsw shelf and see if that helps see also the next item cut copy and paste don t work at all openwindows only oh dear use ps xuaww grep xv to check that sv xv sel svc is running and that either you or root started it depending on whether you started openwindows with openwin or by logging in through xdm if not start it if it dies check that there is no tmp sv xv sel svc before restarting it you may need to be root to remove it or you can reboot your workstation check that there is space in tmp use df tmp and also see if there are a lot of files there with names like tmp tty txt a if there are several hundred of them cut and paste may take so long that it times out quit any deskset tools such as mailtool filemgr and cm calendar start a terminal emulator and remove and tmp tty txt and tmp text files that are still there it s simplest to quit openwin and start it again after doing that if cut and paste was broken but if it starts working again you can just carry on note that files in tmp not owned by you might be in use by another worker comrade so don t remove those without checking first subject trouble shooting not authorized to use display if you get error messages that look like xlib connection to refused by server xlib internal error during connection authorization check error can t open display try on the machine running openwindows or x xhost machine where machine is the computer on which you ran the command that failed if you want to let other users run programs on the same machine as you using your display you will have to type the bizarre looking xhost hostname or xhost happyboy if happyboy is the name of your workstation this lets any user on happyboy access your display with openwindows you can also use xauth and the programmer s guide describes how to do this in chapter p this is more secure also check the man page for fbtab to stop other users accessing the framebuffer directly also note that there is a sun patch for openwindows under sunos to fix a serious security problem it is available through your local sun answer center as well as through anonymous ftp from ftp uu net system in sun dist fix patchid filename checksum loadmodule tar z on an x terminal there may be a setup menu that lets you change or disable the list of hosts that can access the display if you start getting this message after you ve been logged in overnight there might be a cron job that s removing the unix sockets in tmp that are used to communicate with the server when display doesn t have a hostname before the or is empty have the system administrator change the cron script to skip sockets subject trouble shooting other common problems i get console error messages on my screen and they don t go away sun or if refresh makes the messages vanish but new ones come along later you need to run xterm c from your xinitrc or start one up in the background and then choose save workspace from the workspace utilities menu better still pick up contool and run that get it from export lcs mit edu in the contrib directory it will monitor the console and open flash its icon or beep when a message appears it s very easy to configure if refresh from the workspace utilities menu doesn t make the messages go away a sun with a cg frame buffer has two screens you can move the mouse off the right hand by default edge of the screen and onto a whole new but monochrome display called see the man page for openwin i have a shell script that checks for this and if there s a dev cgfour does openwin dev dev cgfour dev dev bwtwo if you are running x or openwindows you might need to add this to your xinitrc or other startup file eval svenv display unix env olvwm display unix later releases of olwm and olvwm do this automatically you can also run switcher e to get rid of the messages also see the note about contool above is there an easy way of editing xdefaults use props which appears in the default root menu as properties this starts props a property editor which will re write your xdefaults after removing comments it then applies any changes keep comments by using comment instead of for example comment font palatino italic how do i get the file manager to use emacs instead of textedit set the default editor to sh c exec emacs font lucidasanstypewriter file you can change the font if you prefer a smaller one how do i run openwindows in inverse video this tends not to work under openwindows with opwnwindows there are various ways including using bg and fg options if you re using openwindows on a sun probably the best you can do short of upgrading the workstation to a sparc is to use xterm instead of cmdtool why don t flat check boxes work a known bug may make guide s output dump core if you use these a workaround is to edit the guide output as it s only guide s output that s broken not the actual check box code this applies only to versions of devguide before devguide if you re still using an ancient devguide you should upgrade as soon as possible the new one is fantastic when i leave openwindows my screen goes blank or my mouse cursor stays on the screen try running clear colormap if this helps put it as the last line in the shell script you use to start openwindows e g openwin when i use snapshot the system crashes or the server hangs or something this was a bug related to some systems only the only work round was to use some other screen dump program such as xwd xv or xgrabsc why have some of my function keys stopped working keys f and f changed from sunf and sunf to sunxk f and sunxk f respectively in openwindows applications must be recompiled or you might be able to use xmodmap or the public domain xkeycaps program to change your keyboard layout back again when i type shelltool or cmdtool or textedit i get the sunview version see under trouble shooting strange error messages below see also next item mixing x and openwindows see also next item note that openwindows includes the x r core distribution to patch level but not the contrib directory these notes apply to openwindows although you could also the do same sort of thing with openwindows and x r install the x libraries in usr lib x you can intermix openwindows and x r or x r they re all compatible in this respect put the x binaries in for example usr bin x put usr bin x last in your path so that you get openwindows versions of programs instead of x ones where appropriate although this is a matter of preference in any event put the openwindows bin directory first see the preceding item for more details on that if you have bin or usr bin they re the same directory on sunos earlier in your path than openwinhome bin xview you ll get sunview programs instead of openwindows ones set ld library path so that usr openwin lib is last after the x library directory this doesn t matter with openwindows but with older versions you ll get error messages from x programs if you don t do this the messages are generally harmless see next item although xdm core dumps if this isn t right set openwinhome to the directory containing openwindows if it isn t usr openwin see also environment variables especially xfilesearchpath i get error messages on my screen about ld so libx so not found set ld library path to be usr openwin if you also use x use usr lib usr lib usr openwin lib if you put this in a shell script or your profile use openwinhome usr openwin lib instead of usr openwin this is for bin sh for csh it is different i launch my filemgr and i get ld so map heap error at dev zero your system needs to be patched look in openwinhome lib ospatches and install the patch why doesn t answerbook run for me you must be running openwindows to use answerbook it won t run under x on an x terminal or on anything else because it uses news to draw the postscript text and pictures if you are using openwindows you need to use the openwindows compatible navigator it s called navigator ow on the answerbook cd rom if all answerbook users are using openwindows you can replace navigator wih navigator ow altogether rename the old one first to satisfy your sense of paranoia the navigator ow binary is also on cd ware vol note that the data files are in postscript so you can look at them with a postsript viewer q v why aren t there any fish in realxfishdb a fixed version of realxfishdb is available by ftp from ftp eng auburn edu as pub realxfishdb z why is the properties choice disabled in the window menu it isn t implemented yet many programs do respond to the properties key l though or have a pop up menu with properties on it file completion in the c shell is broken in cmdtool sadly true but use shelltool or xterm instead and it s fine it also works if you run command tool on a remote machine fixed in openwindows shipped with solaris when i run olit programs some of the widgets are red release of olit added mouseless operation action widgets can be selected via the keyboard the currently selected item is highlighted in red the red stain to show that it has the input focus to disable it in most places add this to your home xdefaults file traversalon off textedit traversalon on textfield traversalon on you can change the color using for example inputfocuscolor grey input focuscolor green list inputfocuscolor your background color see the man page resources w at the start of the olit widget set reference manual included in the openwindows programmer documentation meanwhile contact your distributor and ask for patch id the olit cte jumbo patch when i run several programs the colors on the screen all change when i move into a different window colormap flashing this is becasue most hardware can only display a few colors at a time however you can minimise the effect with the following procedure start all the applications with colors that you wish to reserve run cmap compact save to create the owcolors file put the line cmap compact init near the start of your start up file xinitrc exit and then restart the window system cmap compact init will push those colors owcolors to the end of the colormap and reserves them also note that control l locks the colors of the current window and control l unlocks them this is described in the olwm manual page pageiew uses the wrong colors or makes the colormap flash see above this problem was reported by people for some reason running the motif window manager mwm with openwindows try running pageview like this openwinhome bin reservecolors svmono openwinhome bin pageview openwinhome bin reservecolors discard xdm breaks things command tool doesn t like being run without a unix controlling terminal use etc setsid to start your command tools and all will be well sunview applications may need to be run with svenv as in svenv exec usr bin traffic because xdm won t set the necessary environment variables note that the mit xdm starts up the x server as root which is a security hole for openwindows use the openwindows xdm or be aware that your users can access files and start unix processes ass root function keys and stopped working in openwindows the x names keysyms for these keys was changed to sunxk f and sunxk f code which uses them should be recompiled or you might be able to get away with xmodmap e keysym sunxk f sunf subject trouble shooting xview problems this section is here only until an xview faq appears which has been promised but hasn t reached here note that there is also a usenet newsgroup alt toolkits xview although it doesn t sem to have very wide distribution and has triffic of the order of one or two articles per month you should also look at the faq in comp windows x how do i set the font of individual scrolling list items panel list font takes an int row number and an xv opaque font handle panel list fonts take a null terminated list of xv opaque font handles there is no easy way to make an entire list fixed width font you have to make sure that you always specify panel list font when you insert a new row into that list or write a convenience function insert row list row string that hides the nasty bits how do i keep an xview pop up window displayed after a button is pressed in the button callback do xv set button panel notify status xv error null this will keep the window visible you might also need to investigate the menu notify status attribute how do i make an xview button look pressed call panel begin preview and panel cancel preview these are documented in er the xview source openwindows imake doesn t work properly here is greg earle s patch to be applied in openwinhome note that you should edit lib config sun cf afterwards to get osname and

faster cpu s more disk space faster ethernet these are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the performance of your workstation well more hardware isn t always an option and i wonder if more hardware is always even a necessity this faq list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from x windows on your workstation without purchasing more hardware performance is a highly subjective issue the individual user must balance speed versus features in order to come to a personal decision therefore this document can be be expected to contain many subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts this document is specifically concerned with x there are of course many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation however they are outside the scope of this document people seriously interested in the whole area of system performance might want to look at the o reilly

frequently asked questions document its focus is on general x information while this faq concentrates on performance the comp windows x faq does address the issue of speed but only with regards to the x server the gist of that topic seems to be use x r it is faster than r please see the x faq for complete details window managers there are a lot of window managers out there with lots of different features and abilities the choice of which to use is by necessity a balancing act between performance and useful features at this point most respondents have agreed upon twm as the best candidate for a speedy window manager a couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger is turning off unnecessary things like zooming and opaque move also if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner you reduce the amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping windows joe english joe trystero art com i ve found that a good font for tiling is x aka misc fixed medium r normal c iso it is the biggest font i know of that i can use on my sun x screen and still get two column terminal windows side by side on the display with no overlap other font suggestions will be accepted the x server which server make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware if you have a monochrome monitor use a monochrome x server on my monochrome sun i haven t noticed much difference between the xsun colour server and xsunmono however it was pointed out to me that xsunmono is about k smaller and therefore should contribute to less paging thanks to jonny farringdon j farringdon psychol ucl ac uk michael salmon michael salmon eos ericsson se how your server was compiled can also make a difference jeff law law schirf cs utah edu advises us that on a sun system x should be compiled with gcc version or with the unbundled sun compiler you can expect to get very large speedups in the server by not using the bundled sunos compiler i assume that similar results would occur if you used one of the other high quality commercial compilers on the market locking the server into ram has anyone tried hacking the x server so that it is locked into ram and does not get paged eg via a call to plock does this help performance at all i ve had one inquiry on this topic and a few pointers to the plock function call but no hard evidence from someone who s tried it i am not in a position to give it a try thanks to eric c claeys ecc eperm att com danny backx db sunbim be juan d martin juando cnm us es starting your server joe english joe trystero art com if you start up a lot of clients in your xsession or whatever sleep for a second or two after launching each one after i changed my xclients script to do this logging in actually took less time we have a heavily loaded system without much core though this sounds crazy but i have confirmed that it works warner losh imp solbourne com provided me with a good explanation of why this works which i have summarized here when you start up an x server it takes a huge amount of time to start accepting connections a lot of initialization is done by the server when it starts this process touches a large number of pages any other process running at the same time would fight the server for use of the cpu and more importantly memory if you put a sleep in there you give the server a chance to get itself sorted out before the clients start up similarly there is also a lot of initialization whenever an x client program starts toolkits registering widgets resources being fetched programs initializing state and databases and so forth all this activity is typically memory intensive once this initialization is done the process has reached a steady state the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages by using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your xinitrc you avoid them fighting each other for your workstation s limited resources this is most definitely a your mileage may vary situation as there are so many variables to be considered available ram local swap space load average number of users on your system which clients you are starting etc currently in my xinitrc i have a situation like sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm i ve experimented with sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm i ve even tried sleep exec start x clients script and then in start x clients script i had sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm the idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had completely finished processing my xinitrc and had settled down into a steady state before the sleep expired and all my clients were launched all of these yielded fairly comparable results and so i just stuck with my current setup for its simplicity you will probably have to experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you fonts loading fonts takes time and ram if you minimize the number of fonts your applications use you ll get speed increases in load up time one simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts one small one large one roman whatever suits you and configure all your clients or at least all your heavily used clients to use only those few fonts client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded into the server this will also conserve server resources since fewer fonts will be loaded by the server farrell mckay fbm ptcburp ptcbu oz au joe english joe trystero art com eg my main xterm font is x so i also have twm set up to use x in all it s menus and icons etc twm s default font is x since i don t normally use x i ve eliminated one font from my server oliver jones oj roadrunner pictel com keep fonts local to the workstation rather than loading them over nfs if you will make extensive use of r scalable fonts use a font server about the resources file keep your xresources xdefaults file small saves ram and saves on server startup time joe english joe trystero art com one suggestion in your xdefaults xresources file try putting only the minimum number of resources that you want to have available to all of your applications for example reversevideo true then separate your resources into individual client specific resource files for example home lib app defaults in your login file set the environment variable xuserfilesearchpath setenv xuserfilesearchpath home lib app defaults n the comp windows x frequently asked questions faq contains an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work ed so when xterm launches it loads its resources from app defaults xterm xdvi finds them in app defaults xdvi and so on and so forth note that not all clients follow the same xxxxx resource file naming pattern you can check in your system app defaults directory often usr x r lib x app defaults to find the proper name and then name your personal resource files with the same name this is all documented in the xt specification pg thanks to kevin samborn samborn mtkgc com michael urban urban cobra jpl nasa gov and mike long mikel ee cornell edu kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers this method of organizing your personal resources has the following benefits easier to maintain more usable fewer resources are stored in the x server in the resource manager property as a side benefit your server may start fractionally quicker since it doesn t have to load all your resources applications only process their own resources never have to sort through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them it also has drawbacks the application that you are interested in has to load an additional file every time it starts up this doesn t seem to make that much of a performance difference and you might consider this a huge boon to usability if you are modifying an application s resource database you just need to re run the application without having to xrdb again xrdb will by default run your xdefaults file through cpp when your resources are split out into multiple resource files and then loaded by the individual client programs they will not watch out for this i had c style comments in my xdefaults file which cpp stripped out when i switched to this method of distributed resource files i spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why my clients were not finding their resources xt did not provide any error message when it encountered the c style comments in the resource files it simply silently aborted processing the resource file the loss of preprocessing which can be very handy e g ifdef color is enough to cause some people to dismiss this method of resource management you may also run into some clients which break the rules for example neither emacs nor xvt will find their resources if they are anywhere other than in xdefaults when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files with the machine where your resources are stored your client will not find its resources loading all your resources into the server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find their resources casey leedom casey gauss llnl gov a possible compromise suggestion that i have and am planning on trying is to put resources for all my heavily used clients eg xterm into my xdefaults file and to use the separate resources files method for clients that i seldom use define your display properly client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server in that situation rather than setting your display environment variable to hostname where hostname is the name of your workstation you should set your display variable to unix or by doing this you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests thanks to patrick j horgan pjh ras amdahl com see the display names section of the x man page for further explanation of how to properly set your display name i don t think it s stock mit but at least data general and hp have libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when the display isn t set specially rob sartin opensi sartin uunet uu net jody goldberg jody algorithmics com sent me an xlib patch to change stock r to use local communication even if display is not properly set i don t want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle non mit patches and so have elected not to include it here hopefully mit will apply this minor lines patch themselves in the meantime if you want to try it yourself email jody ed clients if you only have a few megabytes of ram then you should think carefully about the number of programs you are running think also about the kind of programs you are running for example is there a smaller clock program than xclock unfortunately i haven t really noticed that programs advertise how large they are so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients eg xclock xterm xbiff are welcome ed i ve received some contradictory advice from people on the subject of x client programs some advocate the use of programs that are strictly xlib based since xt xaw and other toolkits are rather large others warn us that other applications which you are using may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries in this case using a non xt for example client program may actually increase the amount of ram consumed the upshot of all this seems to be don t mix toolkits that is try and use just athena clients or just xview clients or just motif clients etc if you use more than one then you re dragging in more than one toolkit library know your environment and think carefully about which client programs would work best together in that environment thanks to rob sartin opensi sartin uunet uu net duncan sinclair sinclair dcs gla ac uk sinclair

better terminal emulator for x from the readme file distributed with xterm abandon all hope ye who enter here this is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution ugly maybe but at my site it s still the most used i suspect that xterm is one of the most used clients at many if not most sites laziness isn t there a better terminal emulator available see below if you must use xterm you can

available export lcs mit edu in contrib xvt tar z if you don t need all the esoteric features of xterm then get hold of xvt it was written here just to save swap space as xterm is rather a hog this was written as a partial clone of xterm you don t have to rename your resources as xvt pretends to be xterm in it s current version you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm i ve heard that there are versions of xvt with this feature but i ve not found any yet update march i recently had a few email conversations with brian warkentin brian warkentine eng sun com regarding xvt he questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm for instance xvt may initialize slightly faster but compare scrolling speed try this quickie benchmark bin time dd if etc termcap bs and see which program can scroll faster also while xterm may be slightly larger in ram requirements we don t have any hard numbers here does anyone else shared libraries and shared text segments mean that xterm s paging requirements are not that major as an experiment he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm but it made little difference since if you never use it it never gets brought into memory so here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of xvt over xterm in summary caveat emptor your mileage may vary if you can provide some hard data i d like to see it specifically how much ram each occupies how much swap each needs relative speed of each mterm suggested by der mouse mouse lightning mcrcim mcgill edu available larry mcrcim mcgill edu in x mterm src mterm ball o wax i also have my own terminal emulator its major lack is scrollback but some people like it anyway tuning your client suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster from scott barman scott asd com comes a suggestion regarding motif text field widgets i noticed that during data entry into motif text field widgets i was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes particularly the initial one in the field examining the what was going on with xscope i found it it seems that when the resource xmnblinkrate is non zero and the focus is on a text field widget or even just a text widget the i beam cursor will blink every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets the widget code is making a request to the server copyarea the user can stop this by setting the resource xmnblinkrate to it is not noticeable on a mhz sparc but it does make a little difference on a slower system this specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots of areas consider your heavily used clients are there any minor embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on server requests miscellaneous suggestions pretty pictures don t use large bitmaps gif s etc as root window backgrounds the more complicated your root window bitmap the slower the server is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows or redraw etc these take up ram and cpu power i work on a sun sparc and i m conscious of performance issues i can t comprehend it when i see people with a mb sun running xphoon as their root window i ll let someone else figure out how much ram would be occupied by having a full screen root image on a colour workstation if you re anything like me you need all the screen real estate that you can get for clients and so rarely see the root window anyway thanks to qiang alex zhao azhao cs arizona edu for reminding me of this one ed a quicker mouse using xset you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen when you move your mouse i use xset m

fast xset m normal fast xset m system default un accelerated xset m default glacial xset m programming thoughts joe english joe trystero art com to speed up applications that you re developing there are tons of things you can do some that stick out for motif programs don t set xmfontlist resources for individual buttons labels lists et al use the defaultfontlist or labelfontlist or whatever resource of the highest level manager widget again stick to as few fonts as possible better yet don t use motif at all it s an absolute pig don t create and destroy widgets on the fly try to reuse them this will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits too use a line width of in gcs on some servers this makes a huge difference compress and collapse multiple expose events this can make the difference between a fast application and a completely unusable one francois staes frans kiwi uia ac be just a small remark i once heard that using a better malloc function would greatly increase performance of xt based applications since they use malloc heavily they suggested trying out the gnuy malloc but i didn t find the time yet i did some tests on small programs just doing malloc and free and the differences were indeed very noticeable somewhat times faster any confirmation on this from anyone ed andre beck andre beck irs inf tu dresden de unnecessary noexpose events most people use xcopyarea xcopyplane as fastest blit routines but they forget to reset graphics exposures in the gc used for the blits this will cause a noexpose event every blit that in most cases only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to run through it s event loop again and again thousands of xchangegc requests this gfx context switching is also seen in most handcoded x apps where only one or few gcs are created and then heavily changed again and again xt uses a definitely better mechanism by caching and sharing a lot of gcs with all needed parameters this will remove the load of subsequent xchangegc requests from the connection by moving it toward the client startup phase say what some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first david b lewis by day dbl osf org by night david craft uunet uu net how about this swap displays with someone else run all your programs on the other machine and display locally the other user runs off your machine onto the

the impact of my intrusion this helps a lot on my poor little ss with only mb it was essential when i only had mb casey leedom casey gauss llnl gov the x server and the client are competing for the same cpu as your server when you run it on the same machine not really a major problem except that the x client and the server are in absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing timothy h panton thp westhawk uucp firstly it relies on the fact that most cpu s are mostly idle x s cpu usage is bursty so the chances of you and your teammate doing something cpu intensive at the same time is small if they are not then you get twice the cpu memory available for your action the second factor is that context switches are expensive using cpu s halves them you pay a price due to the overhead of going over the network but this is offset in most cases by the improved buffering of a network typically k vs k for a pipe allowing even fewer context switches other sources of information volume in o

painting with increasing resolution some people working a few cubes over have come up with this need and it seems that someone out there just might have done it already and can point me to some tools that would help what they d like to do is given a window that is taking a long time to draw because either the data is arriving over a slow link or the display is across a slow link they would like to first paint a low resolution version of the picture and then repaint it in higher resolution thus the picture might first be generated in resolution with each x square of pixels being filled in with a single color next each x square would be replaced by x squares finally the x version would be painted since one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other side of a slow link the low res version obviously wouldn t be transmitted as a bitmap that wouldn t help at all instead there would have to be a process on the far end that receives the low res picture as a small bitmap and blows up each pixel into a square sorta like the magnifier programs do this brings up the question of whether the x server can help that is when a window is opened is there a way to ask that a filter program be run to process the pixels or is the only way to use something like rsh to start up a remote process permission denied and have it open a local window it seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts up such a program remotely and then accepts bitmaps compressing each one by some amount and sending them to the remote program to expand but if there is something that x itself can do to help it s be nice to hear about it i looked in several fms but if it s there i obviously don t know the keywords if someone has a nifty tool available that packages it all we might want to get a copy oh yes this is to run on some suns part of the idea is to build demos that can show such things as if this were run across say a bps link this is how fast the pictures would appear then the customer would get a feel for the speed that they need to pay for if the auto industry were like the computer industry a car would now cost would get miles to the gallon and at random times would explode killing all its passengers

xview sun xgl performance problem i ve written an application for sparcstation gx under openwindows the application uses xview stuff to create my window and the sun xgl graphics library for rendering into the canvas the application does real time d animation but it does not update the the display fast enough i m using notify set itimer xview call to periodically kick off my update routine and it s not happening fast enough i want it to update times second it s only doing about also it appears to be compute bound because if i run anything else while my appplication is up the update rate slows down even more any ideas thanks

re xterm fonts in article may taylor uucp mark taylor uucp mark a davis writes i have a problem which many of you might have run into we use lots of ascii terminals and use them to the max meaning lots of attributes line draw etc now what i need to do is come up with a working xterm which will emulate our advanced ascii terminals as closely as possible this means needing all attributes to work including bold and line drawing the only fonts which seem to meet these criteria are a pairs of fonts in which one is bold and the other normal while both have linedraw fixed spacing and several sizes the only standard fonts which work are the fonts like x and x b under misc they work great except i need a font one size larger x now x works well but there is no bold counterpart to make matters worse i need the fonts in some form i can use for tektronix xterminals it seems they like pcf format although i should be able to convert a bdf format anyone have any suggestions mark a davis lake taylor hospital norfolk va x sys administrator computer services mark taylor mark taylor uucp this would be tedious but if you have the time you could get the bdf file i can email it to you if you don t have it or don t have easy access to the x source and could make your own bold font from this since each glyph is just a bitmap you could write a program to convert each glyph to a bitmap readable file use bitmap to make each glyph bold and convert the results back to bdf format then use bdftopcf to create the pcf file then stick the pcf in usr lib x fonts misc or wherever and include it in fonts dir and voila you ll have what you need ernie coskrey ncr corporation mcpd columbia ernie coskrey columbiasc ncr com platt springs road west columbia sc i m out there busting my buns every night tell your old man to drag walton and lanier up and down the court for minutes roger murdoch co pilot

void test cmd char n edit myedit settext n void test quit void exit void xmapp initialize new test initialize then continue reading contents of the current release s readme xm is a user interface framework for the c language built upon x and the x toolkit it is designed to be a simple and intuitive programming interface to access the functionality of commonly used widgets xm was initially created for the motif widget set now support for the athena widgets was added applications created with xm run in both environments without changes although many nice features are only available when using motif in some situations xm extends the underlying toolkit i e providing a combobox borrowed from ms windows but never tries to replace it data of user interface objects is left to the widgets and only duplicated in rare cases xm has nothing common with motif besides the general idea to encapsulate motif widgets in c objects and the in it s name many ideas for the xm architecture came from digitalk s smalltalk version which provides an easy to use framework for windows pm mac applications in the very first time of development i used the windows dialog editor and a simple parser to create similar smalltalk and xm dialogs top level objects in xm windows systemdialogs and toolboxes which use the automatic layout feature of various composite widgets in motif and xaw userdialogs which can be individually laid out with a user interface builder a first version of such a dialog editor is included in this distribution controls children of top level objects statictext staticimage pushbutton checkbox radiobutton edit listbox combobox groupbox panearea drawing toolbar the staticimage and all the button classes can display b w x bitmap format or color gif format pictures as an alternative to a label text event handling is done by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirects xt callbacks to member functions of xm objects commoninteract ii is built upon the xm drawing class and provides components for building direct manipulative applications is is a very simplified implementation of some features from the commoninteract system research project of our institute in an approach to define a software achitecture for implementing direct manipulative applications with multiple interaction media i e sound alternative input devices if you are interrested look into the june issue of the joop sigs publications journal of object oriented programming there should be our paper about commoninteract but be aware that it is our state of the art from commoninteract ii is still undocumented and is included because it was used to implement the dialog editor it currently supports only drawing primitives lines rectangles circles but we plan to extend it to support bitmaps and some controls also known problem the xm drawing class has no redrawing strategy always redraws the whole window even after minimal changes like selecting an object this looks very ugly on slow displays and should be fixed about this first release xm is still incomplete and has a lot of bugs but we are using it here for smaller applications which are running without problems so i think i can call it a beta release which can be used to develop applications for any non critical purposes commoninteract may be called a pre alpha release it s development will be continued this year because we plan to use it for another research project here besides incompleteness and the redrawing problem it seems to be stable and can be used for experimental applications platforms this release was compiled and tested on hp running hp ux sun sparc running sunos release pc at running linux v pl caution although the whole stuff was initially developed using an at t standard c compiler this release is tested only with gnu g or above the next release will be tested with both compilers where to get it i have uploaded it on export lcs mit edu as contrib xm tar z send a mail if you cannot find it

re colors and x windows aicons excerpts from netnews comp windows x may re colors and x windows a john cwikla morrison wri the problem is that we need solutions for applications now and although i would love to have most of the things mentioned here somebody has to write it what i d like to see is this scenario each widget view whatever describes it s colors via a palette palettes can be shared and they only contain descriptive information they are not directly tied to the object that uses them palettes are held in the server a palette can accomadate up to the number of hardware color cells of color descriptors when the input focus is in a particular widget that widget has access to all of the colors that are described in its associated palette all other widgets transiently get the closest approximation that can be generated by a union of the colors from the current palette and any free colors that are left over a widget specifies a color for imaging by providing an index pixel into its associated palette the bold part above is hard and would need to be done in the server

re help needed callbacks actions and events i understood that there are two methods to connect application code to widgets callbacks and actions the problem i face now is that i have a quite long piece of application code that performs a lot of drawing into a window i want to connect this to a widget no problem so far i could use a callback function or an action to do this processing any events afterwards but because the drawing takes some while i want the application code sequence to be able to be interrupted by events then i want to handle the events and resume with processing the application code at the point it was interrupted it seems to me that this isn t possible but how can i give the user the impression that his inputs are immediately processed use a workproc see xtappaddworkproc xt you should split your drawing routnie up into small chunks this is the hard part then in the callback that starts the drawing you call xtappaddworkproc to call your workproc the first time your workproc should be a function that returns a boolean true when you are finished and false when you want to keep processing if you return false the workproc is automatically re installed note that this method is better that using a time out loop since events get processed in a more precedence oriented manner if you are using the same ada bindings i am however you are hosed and should look into xtappaddtimeout xt joe hildebrand hildjj fuentez com software engineer fuentez systems concepts standard disclaimers apply

makedepend problem hi netters we have a problem with makedepend it doesn t know how to correctly process if clause in c preprocessor statements it evaluates everything to true no matter what the conditionals are for example makedepend chokes on one of x include files as distributed by sun namely xos h if defined sunos defined stdc include string h define index strchr define rindex strrchr else bsd stdc include strings h endif sunos stdc here makedepend evaluates both if and corresponding else statements to true and tries to open the file strings h which doesn t exist under solaris we also have a lot of if statements in some of our legacy code we got and built makedepend off the net it didn t fix the problem in all fairness it should be noted that makdepend man page sun s distribution mentions this problem bugs if you do not have the source for cpp the berkeley c preprocessor then makedepend will be compiled in such a way that all if directives will evaluate to true regardless of their actual value this may cause the wrong include directives to be evaluated makedepend should simply have its own parser written for if expressions has anybody come up with some solution fix to makdepend other than writeyourownparser and willing to share it with us since we often experience delays in our newsfeed please reply directly to my e mail address i ll post a summary thanks in advance michael turok information resources inc e mail mlt blues infores com fifth avenue voice ext waltham ma usa fax

get it to work with the scsi controller in my computer the guy tested it with his pc and printed out a copy of the norton disk doctor report which says it has no bad sectors i ll send you a copy i was dumb enough not to get his phone number so i can t return it to him the drive has many jumpers on it which i don t know how to set so maybe that s the problem i was quite disappointed that it didn t work so i m trying to minimize my losses meg scsi hard drive conner model cp same situation as above i bought both of these drives from the same guy despite the different model numbers they are the same exact drive same report from ndd i have one for each drive will be included meg sony scsi hard drive sony model srd a the drive mechanism is completely trashed this hard drive was in my computer mac se and had a stiction problem well repeated banging on the side of the computer resulted in a head crash yes metal scraping metal which was not too pleasant to listen to still the scsi controller card is in good working order and can be used for parts or a project meg seagate hh scsi hard drive model st n i originally bought this drive because it had a small stiction problem and i though that i could fix it well i determined that the drive mechanism was fine and that it was a controller problem motor controller wasn t sending proper signals well after taking the controller off the drive looking at it and putting it back together i realized that i accidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the drive to the controller i tried to solder it but i m not that good at soldering so i couldn t do it worked perfectly before i messed up i used it as a temporary drive when the sony above crashed on me also loaded the drive with about twenty mac applications worth well over claris cad ms word think c excel and many others i think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable you also get all the software on the drive if you can accept being a pirate i only ask that you delete my data files from the drive i was really angry when i broke that connection and then couldn t fix it i just don t have time to play with it any more at t isdn modem this is for use on digital phone systems if you know what this is or would like technical information on it let me know i have some tech documents on it is supposed to be the same thing as an at t digital phone but without the phone part it seems to be in working order passes self test perfectly ok i have no idea how this is worth let me know if you re interested motorola coprocessor i haven t tested this one out yet but if anyone is interested i will get it tested out to make sure that it works i had trouble using it with my accelerator board but then i spoke to the manufacturer of the board and found out it couldn t be used without another controller chip when i was looking around to buy one new the prices were around i will guarantee this to work cga card half length bit wasn t working last time i checked although i think i was using a bad monitor k floppy drive ibm drive type guaranteed to work because when i took it out of the pc it was working k floppy drive toshiba model number nd de a guaranteed to work came out of same pc as above floppy drives can t guarantee that these will work i don t even know if they are low or high density drives i don t have any method of testing them panasonic model number ju acg there s another number on it panasonic model number ju agg there s also another number on it h toshiba model number nd de virtually identical to the one above each drive ps drive these things are proprietary so i can t test it but i think it works not sure if it s high density or low density but i suppose someone who is looking for one would know model number dfl c a i think these things are expensive to replace mfm hard drive controller cards i ve got three of these and i have no way of testing them two of them are bit cards and one is a sixteen bit card with a

re rfi art of clutchless shifting i m not familiar with the trannies used in winston cup but in the trans am cars i ve played with the transmissions were the racing variety with dog clutches instead of sychros in a transmission with dog clutches the gears are always engaged with each other and moving the dog clutches engages the gears to the shafts motorcycle transmissions are the same way shifting without the clutch on a transmission with syncros can and will cause transmission damage the only question being how long it takesto grenade something for the trans in my pulsar se it was about k miles but it had a weak tranny in the first place just out of curiosity how is this dog clutch any different from a synchro transmission what you described sounds the same to me in fact what little i ve studied on trannies the instructor referred to the synchros as dogs and said they were synonymous the gears are always meshed in a synchronized gearbox and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting or at least that is what i was taught explain por favour motorcycle transmissions don t have synchros the engagment dogs are very corse and sloppy there are maybe teeth dogs on the side of the gears that engage the next gear over as the forks slide the gears back and forth to shift start to apply pressure at the same time the clutch is pulled the clutch is a hand lever and shift quickly if you try a slow lazy shift it will grind you just have to pop it into the next gear before it has a chance to grind there isn t a neutral between gears obviously there is but you can t select it with the shifter so double clutching is not a possibility speed shifting which is what i have always heard clutchless shifting called works pretty well for upshifts with some practice but i usually use the clutch especially for the lower gears i think auto as in automobile trannys are similar except that the engagment dogs are very fine with no slop and the addition of syncho rings the gear teeth are always engaged in auto transmissions that are synchronized but may not be in non synchro gears reverse and sometimes first frank ball ur m frankb sad hp com work hewlett packard fax home valley house drive it xt seca f pl rohnert park ca kc wug law ama dod i m the nra

re saturn extended warranty in article u uicvm uic edu u uicvm uic edu writes i agree with gaia even though the saturn has proved to be a very reliable car so far a little money spent now is worth the peace of mind this is an interesting point some people are not really buying the coverage they are buying peace of mind marketing folks love selling that i suggest that people choose to not engage their minds in peaceless worry rather than buying that peace of mind in my opinion getting the powertrain warranty is enough in my case that s be cause anything that needed repairing in the interior sunroof windows doors etc i could do myself i just didn t want to mess with the engine and such you d be surprised how much the little knick knack stuff can cost what if your a c goes out steering rack don t get me wrong i m against all extended warranties they are a ripoff plus i think the extra years of hour roadside assistance must be worthe so meting i opted for the year plan for extra yrs you realize the first yr k is free warranty that comes with the car thomas

production hold on firebird camaro w speed after a tip from gary crum crum fcom cc utah edu i got on the phone with pontiac systems or pontaic customer service or whatever and inquired about a rumoured production hold on the formula firebird and trans am btw talking with the dealer i bought the car from got me nowhere after being routed to a firebird specialist i was able to confirm that this is in fact the case at first there was some problem with the performance axle ratio she wouldn t go into any details so i don t know if there were some shipped that had problems or if production was held up because they simply didn t have the proper parts from the supplier as i say she was pretty vague on that so if anyone else knows anything about this feel free to respond supposedly this problem is now solved second there is a definate shortage of parts that is somehow related to the six speed manual transmission so as of this posting there is a production hold on these cars she claimed part of the delay was not wanting to use inferior quality parts for the car and therefore having to wait for the right high quality parts i m not positive that this applies to the camaro as well but i m guessing it would can anyone else shed some light on this chris s chris silvester any man capable of getting himself elected president chriss sam amgen com should by no means be allowed to do the job chriss netcom com douglas adams the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy

re is car saftey important s in a previous article jimf centerline com jim frost says jnielsen magnus acs ohio state edu john f nielsen writes in article r jr m v armory centerline com jimf centerline com jim frost writes tcorkum bnr ca trevor corkum writes i figure that mph collisions into brick walls aren t common enough for me to spend that much extra money for protection but there are lots of low speed collisions that do worry me get into an mph accident and you may reconsider i ve been in one and it is really scarey my life is something i value more than a car s looks or handeling consider it insurance it may not happen often but when it does you ll sure be glad you got a safe car granted the tests aren t perfect but i d much rather be in a car that did well in the test than a car that did horribly you raise a valid point but again it s a tradeoff how much money do you want to spend for that kind of protection you could buy a volvo saab or benz and get really good crash protection and other luxuries but you ll pay significantly more for it in my case it s out of the question because all of those cars are beyond my budget i ve been in two major auto accidents both were multiple car the worst was a head on three car collision t intersection and one person ran a stop sign in both cases i was stopped and had no place to go and i saw it coming both times even in high speed head on collisions the most beneficial item you can have is a good old point seatbelt nowadays at least in the us you get an airbag if you get a point belt so presumably you get an added safety benefit there as well that s something i certainly look for and which can be had in inexpensive cars if you really want to add safety to any car simply add a cage to the car they are available and cheap about in the usa add to that four or five or six point belts and you will walk away from collisions that were otherwise not survivable but instead of people spending a little extra money we get legislation that says the gov t must mandate a minimal level of protection for everyone one other significant factor in improving one s own safety is to get some training this will improve your safety more than any other single investment will drive ride defensively and that does not mean you have to be a doddering old stick in the mud people here tend to enthuse about autos more than the average probably in the top th percentile in driving ability but still we sometimes overlook the obvious i ve been to two driving schools and three riding schools for my motorcycle a very worthwhile investment and besides it was a lot of fun too safety is what you make of it just because a carmaker doesn t provide you with an adequate level of protection doesn t mean you have to leave it go at that al bowers dod alfa ducati hobie kottke blad iaido nasa well goodness sakes don t you know that girls can t play guitar mary chapin carpenter

re dirty diesels from nataraja rtsg mot com kumaravel natarajan but they can put out a lot of particulate matter i heard something about legislation being discussed to clean up diesel emissions is there anything in the works to install scrubbers for diesels how about the feasibility of installing them on trucks and cars would it be any different than a catylitic converter i d assume easier since we re removing particulate matter instead of converting gasses let s hear people s opinions the technology cummins is applying to diesels to comply with the newer ca emissions laws involves three things i know of all compliant diesels are turbocharged all use an aftercooler which cools the air which was heated by compression by the turbocharger up to about psi a gismo on the injector pump which senses the pressurized air intake and limits full delivery of fuel while the pressure is low no scrubbers catalytic converters etc are used the path from the turbocharger to the exhaust outlet is kept very free interestingly except for the low pressure fuel limitation power output and mileage are enhanced by these measures one can buy aftermarket turbos and aftercoolers which generate more power lots more power and these are approved by the carb dan hepner

horizontally opposed boxer engines was v v v v vx in article apr magnus acs ohio state edu bqueiser magnus acs ohio state edu brian j queiser writes there are two crank configurations for the flat the most common one is probably the crank that is very similar to the i crank which flat engines have i style cranks comparing those two engines the i and the flat have no first order shaking forces or rocking moments the i has a second order shaking force while the flat has a second order rocking moment the significant thing about the flat s second order moment is that it can be easily balanced out by adding mass at the ends of the crank the i however requires a counter rotating shaft with mass to balance out the second order forces i am sure that subaru and porsche use the boxer configuration and not the inline crank that you analyzed and compared would you care to re evaluate the other case of a flat four i think that this configuration is perfectly balanced as far as primary secondary forces and couples are concerned i have an article in front of me that says so bottom line the biggest difference between the engines would probably be their intended use the flat is easier to fit under low hoods and in rear compartments for mid or rear mounting the i can be mounted transversely to reduce hood length read cab forward other than that there isn t much fanfare to the differences between them no matter what subaru ads say technology shared with porsche indeed the flat four is also shorter than an inline so even if it is mounted longitudinally it will not take up lots of length and a longitudinal placement is easier for a wheel drive drivetrain i think that subaru s ads hold water in practice their flat fours are noticeably smoother than inline s and completely buzz free though some may not like its peculiar note but as alfa has shown a boxer four can produce a spine tingling scream that only the likes of recent hondas can approach eliot

camrys eating clutch master cyls i have both an and an camry each with manual speed transmissions the has about miles on it and the about miles about a year ago i found that the master cylinder on the clutch in the was leaking fluid around the piston seal leading to air in the system and fluid back into the passenger compartment of the car i pulled the plunger and got a rebuild kit new plunger seal etc and thought i had the problem licked much to my surprise the same problem developed several months later this time i looked carefully at the master cylinder to make sure there were no scratches burrs or other obvious causes of the problem i didn t find any ever since i have been periodically feeding the clutch hydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system i knew i would be selling the car and didn t want to go all the way to solving the problem i should add that the clutch is original and that i ve had to adjust the pedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in order to actuate the clutch my hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal the angle of the piston rod attached to the pedal is off the axix of the cylinder thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it what do you think of that as an explanation can you suggest a possible fix short of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in now the same problem except that the above diagnosis doesn t explain why all of the fluid leaked out by way of the master cylinder into the passenger compartment while i was on vacation for days during which the clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort what can you suggest here many thanks let s hope i don t end up going to click and clack on this bill christens barry cerulean access digex com
auto wax having recently purchased a probe with clear coat paint i would like to give it a good wax job what is the best type of wax to use for this type of finish is paste or liquid better i would be waxing it by hand and buffing it by hand i guess using cheesecloth to buff it anything better you would suggest i ve heard comments here before about things like turtle wax and raindance not being very good so i m wondering what is recommended for a quality finish thanks in advance bill bill heiser heiser acs bu edu heiser world std com boston university boston ma

re ford probe opinions centered around the gt in article apr ncsu edu chuck eos ncsu edu chuck kesler writes jeremy g mereness zonker cmu edu says can anyone offer any opinions of the ford probe ala how they do in the long run repair records reliability mileage etc some other owners on the ford probe world std com mailing list have commented about this problem but i haven t seen it happen on my month old probe gt i think this may be something that ford has corrected since the initial batch of cars also someone said that ford has issued a service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem so you may be able to get your dealer to fix it i have had my probe looked at twice by my local dealer where i purchased the car the first time they made this problem worse the second time after advising them of the service bulletin mentioned on my ford probe mailing list they said they didn t know of the bulletin they adjusted the window and made it much better however it now makes a scritch scritch noise on rough roads and still squeals when i open close the window in wet weather anyone elses s do this ford only gives key with the car c mon ford spend an extra few pennies i got two keys with my car but only one remote entry push button thingie but then i bought my with miles and i think it may have been a repossession so i m not surprised something was missing horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference i am seriously considering following the advice in the owners manual where it describes the procedure to follow if you discover something on your ford that could cause serious injury threaten lives etc something about notifying the national traffic safety group as well as ford those little you ve got to position the fingers perfectly to make it beep buttons are terrible the latter is probably because of the air bag it s pretty much takes up all the space where you d expect to find the horn speaking of the horn i was surprised to find that the probe comes with one of those nice merican sounding horns instead of the japanese sounding kind the previous probes had japanese horns well i guess that s good in a way but in a way it s bad when someone hears that kind of horn they expect to see a big american car they may not associate the sound with a small jap car style car like the probe is tires fling dirt mud onto side of car yeah not very badly but enough to be annoying sometimes the mudflaps help a lot transmission the speed is a must i have always been a speed guy almost every car i ve ever owned has been a speed because i got a good deal on this car with the miles i knowingly overlooked the fact that it has an automatic but it is a pretty high tech automatic it is a fully electronicaly controlled speed with torque converter lockup even with the automatic i m getting mpg on the highway driving but of course driving is illegal so i probably made that sentence up around town the mileage has been around not bad for an automatic of course it doesn t have the control of a speed but since i do a lot of city driving it turns out to be very convenient it s nice to be able to drink a cup of coffee and drive at the same time although that too is illegal here in we like to control your life massachusetts no shake rattle noises when going over bumps potholes still shakes and rattles has been my main gripe i ve gotten them to fix the worst of them but i fear that with the rather harsh ride the car will be a virtual potpouri of rattles when it gets older tires vr goodyear eagles left hoping for k on my probe gl i got about k out of the original goodyears and had driven the replacement tires bridgestone k miles when i tradeed the car the vr firestones on my probe look like they re designed for performance ie rather wide shallow tread etc so they probably won t last as long but the car handles very very very well it sticks to the road like glue even on a rough surface interior is very very nice too very pleasing to the eye and ergonomically sound definitely ford mazda did a very very nice job on this one the car has a much more expensive than it actually is look and feel to it yes this car s stiff suspension isn t for everyone i personally like it but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car i d strongly suggest looking into the mx having driven an probe for years i find the suspension interesting the car actually drives much better than the it is a very firm ride and you definitely know about each and every bump in the road yet the car remains very civilized on even the bumpiest roads you hear and feel the bumps yet the car retains its posture very well if you have passengers by all means bring them along too they ll find that they have no room in the back and you ll find that the car rides differently if that s better is up to you well i wouldn t encourage passenger carrying in the probe unless the person in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the dash as mentioned in the consumer reports write ups consider the back seat as a parcel shelf no biggie to me though if it had been i d not have bought the car but it s definitely not a family car also there s a lot of glass around you which i wasn t expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer a c is a must on any probe from the in particular sends out a real blast of cool air when the ac is on max that lots of glass you mentioned is what gives the car the very good visibility reports you see in all the write ups most sports sporty cars don t have that good visibility i ve heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine i haven t heard about this one i know that some of the very early probes and maybe had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers which the complaints i ve heard re exhaust system on s have been on the gt of course being a different engine that is a differeent exhaust system i was one of those with an who qualified for the free replacement since i had already replaced the muffler when i received the notice i was am due a refund from ford i applied in february and am still waiting gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that i was without my car i was quite happy with the way they handled especially considering that i was expecting the worst from them yes i was pretty amazed when i had my car in for some touch up adjustments this past week and they had to keep it overnight too busy for them to get to it and they offered to pay for a rental they did make me pay for taxes and insurance though from what i ve heard it sounds like ford mazda had some qc problems with the probe and probably mx when they first went into production but i think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point that s almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this though i have to agree that they seem to have some qc problesm but i seriously feel the car design is sound and expect it to do very well bill heiser heiser acs bu edu heiser world std com boston university boston ma
re water in trunk of probe in article apr news arc nasa gov chung pioneer arc nasa gov po sum chung acf writes tommy szeto writes water gradually builds up in the trunk of my friend s ford probe every once in a while we would have to remove the spare and scoop out the water under the plywood carpet cover on the trunk i would guess this usually i noticed this is my probe also when recently cleaning out the back i think the water is coming up through some rubber stoppered holes beneath the spare mine looked slightly worn and there was no water or water damage i have the same problem with my probe the water is definitely not comming up from the rubber stoppered hole beneath the spare i have to remove the rubber stopper to drain the water seems like a common problem with probe there is a known problem with the seals on the taillights of probes complain loudly to your dealer and get them to install new seals it is a known problem present on most if not all pre probes so you shouldn t have to pay them to fix it in my case they fixed it on my extended warranty i just had to pay a deductable the work was valued at something like with labor and parts having removed the tail lamps myself on other occasions i think their estimate was fair bill heiser heiser acs bu edu heiser world std com boston university boston ma

review ford taurus sho review of ford taurus sho by gene kim background last week i bought a ford taurus sho moving up from driving a toyota celica st and a oldsmobile cutlass i have been interested in buying a sho for about five months and have been combing the classifieds in denver and chicago every week i bought a remarkably clean maroon red sho with k miles on it for as far as i can tell this is about under blue book and i still have another miles before the extended service plan runs out as one should with any pre shos i made sure that the car was already refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate as well as having been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments however my sho does not have the newer rod shifter i understand i can get this for from any ford service center in addition the car received the full tune up at k miles receiving new platinum plugs and valve adjustment for a car with k miles on it the car was virtually immaculate the clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents although the front air dam molding was covered with lots of small scratches not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the highway having driven a smaller two door coupe for so long i was a bit concerned about whether i could get used to driving a larger car to my surprise the size of the car doesn t bother me at all it seems just as nimble as my celica no comparisons with my oldsmobile visibility from the driver s seat is excellent helped mostly by of the small the quarter windows aft of the back seat door windows and in front of the c pillar and rear window parallel parking is a bit more difficult but other than that i love the size in fact i m starting to appreciate the large trunk as i pack up for a hour drive to washington dc for the summer more on the ride later in this review engine as with anyone even slightly interested in shos i was very interested in the valve l yamaha shogun engine i was not disappointed base performance of the engine under rpms is good you can even do reasonable launches from second gear although i don t make a practice of this the engine revs smoothly and eagerly tooling around town does not require many shifts this is good since the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car more on this later while the performance of the engine under rpms may be unremarkable it undergoes a jekyll hyde transformation once you hit higher revs at rpms a butterfly valve opens and you can literally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve more valves open up the engine soars to its rpm redline and you are treated to in my opinion the sweetest sounding v around the engine inexplicably sounds overjoyed to be at rpm i ve noticed that when i drive around town i constantly watch the tach to see how far below rpm i am to go from rpm to you may have to punch the accelerator while torque is more than adequate it doesn t come fully online until those other valves are used transmission when car and driver first reviewed the car in they marvelled at how ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter into the car i remember driving a friend s parent s sho in and remember thinking about whether i had the leg strength to drive the car in traffic the clutch was that stiff that was back then the entire clutch assembly on my sho has been replaced under a ford recall in the clutch on the sho feels no stiffer than the one on my toyota celica in fact the friction point seems a bit larger and more forgiving when playing with the shifter with the car parked the shifter felt very reasonable the and gates were where you d expect it to be and the shifting action was smooth on the road it s much the same but you have to shift slowly make no mistake it s a clumsy shifter when hurrying shifts like when i was initially trying to impress friends i consistently miss the shift often grope clumsily for the shift and sometimes even muff the shift i find this pretty amazing in a car like this it also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest shifts when you take your time seems obvious but compared to my toyota and my friend s honda this seems atrocious and clumsy someone on rec autos noted that crxs should blow shos off the line because of the incredibly clumsy shifter i now shift much more sedately and the shifter seems more reasonable when you play within these bounds the shifter works smoothly with no surprises i don t know whether the rod shifter upgrade would help at all along these same lines i initially had trouble shifting gears smoothly again slowing down the shifts and taking more care to match revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely this took several days for me to get the hang of i think some of my problems were because i ve never had a car with enough power to balk at bad shifts in higher gears occasionally i have trouble shifting into reverse the shifter refuses to enter the gate and i often grind the synchros trying to get it into gear i ll be watching this carefully in the next couple of months a quirk when i upshift and the engine drops back to rpm i hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the engine compartment not terribly loud but the passenger can definitely hear it i asked about it when i was looking at the car as do all my passengers apparently this is a definitely a sho sound and is the gearbox apparently called gear rollover replies to my queries on rec autos are at the end of this review exterior as i mentioned before i am astounded by how well the body of this sho has stood up paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are virtually non existent looking at how older tauri sometimes don t age so gracefully i wonder what the guys at ford did differently to the sho bodies the body in my opinion is extremely attractive with matching color body moldings than the stock tauri for some odd reason the sho seems different enough from vanilla tauri to get stares at stoplights of course this could be my overactive imagination shos get fog lights a more open grille a completely monochromatic exterior and a deeper ground skirt in the back with sho stenciled in relief i ve seen a couple shos whose owners have colored these in with florescent colors or in black yuck i don t think the car is flashy i like it that way i feel almost anonymous with all those tauri out there but different and distinctive enough to those of us who care interior the interior is what really makes me feel like i don t deserve the car the seats are grey leather the steering wheel and shifter are covered with black leather and the entire instrument panel is done in a black grey metallic scheme the instrumentation is stock taurus except for the mph speedo and rpm tach you get a center console with two cupholders a large compartment under the radio great for a cd player an armrest that contains yet another compartment three appropriately sized coin holders for tollways i think and a compartment for holding cassette tapes there s map holders in the doors and an oddly small glove compartment i spilled a whole can of coke in the cupholder and was delighted to find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a sink hey i m really impressed with the ergonomics and thoughtfulness that went into its design and it s a before the interior was upgraded the backseat is bigger than any car i ve had why do they need so much space no smart ass comments please the driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters from what i hear it s not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear mine is no exception the left side bolster on the driver s has cracked and i m not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the way a big surprise for me i forgot that shos don t have a normal hand parking brake instead they have the regular parking brake that you press with your left foot too bad again i m getting used to it but it seems a bit anachronistic to me ride the suspension is nice and stiff too stiff it s stiffer than any car i ve had a friend s new toyota celica st seems tauter and is still able to soak up bumps better the sho seems stiffer with less ability to soak up bumps driving over railroad tracks is a noisy and jarring affair on the other hand taking turns feels wonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn t flex at all i listened for that before i bought the car on the highway the ride is great when i drove the car from chicago back to purdue i had trouble keeping under mph let alone from trying to see what mph really feels like it s a relatively quiet ride but the sunroof rattles i ve tried to find out what exactly makes all the noise up there but it seems to be the window that rests on the rails no easy way to get rid of it i think over the past three days i ve oscillated between thinking the suspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way too rough not for me mind you but i wonder whether i would advise my dad to buy one for himself but i ve discovered as with the shifter if you take your time with shifts you ll have no reason to complain let me explain the ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the wheels i feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer making the car skitter left and right after i understood this i avoid the limits of traction and i m a happy camper again it s not body rigidity but the composure of the car as if matching the suspension the steering feel is quite heavy my first impression of driving my sho was how hard you had to turn the wheel at highway speeds it tracks straight as an arrow but when driving around a parking lot the high effort steering didn t seem so useful however it s reasonable but it doesn t communicate the road to the driver as well as a ford probe gt imho it s much better than the steering on my celica st i wonder how bad this car is during winter miscellaneous notes gripes the rattles from the sunroof is intermittent some days it rattles loudly other days i look up wondering where all the noise went activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy loud squealing as it retracts on its rails i wonder if there is a quick fix for this again other days it completely disappears function of humidity once i made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension and torque steer i ve never complained about ride i wish the seats had more support under the thighs also i wish the side bolsters would close more tightly i hear that tires for this car can get really expensive i currently have goodyear gt s that cost the previous owner for four i used to hate the ford stereo systems whose idea was it to use a volume paddle now to my amazement i don t really mind and sometimes think it s an okay idea pretty ridiculous though getting up to rpm sometimes seems to be a chore but this is no big deal there is more than enough torque down low i often goof up the shifting when driving with friends it took me a couple of days before i could really shift smoothly from nd to rd gear hard to believe isn t it my car has almost miles on it my parents noted that it is almost impossible to find a low mileage sho astute observation imho i wonder how long i can make my sho last i just bought a book titled drive it forever for tips in this department the goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop i once parked the car in gear and then accidentally let out the clutch after i started it the car jolted forward and bounced off the car in front of me no paint damage at all but starting the car is a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal also i began to wonder how strong that brake really is today i backed out of parking spot today and started to drive away before i noticed the glowing brake light oops the driver s power window creaks when closed all the way the same thing happens in my parents mercury sable oddly all the other windows work smoothly likes i m liking the interior amenities more and more each day the cupholders are great i didn t expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much but it really is handy you can lock all the doors by pressing the and buttons together neat and you can never lock yourself out of the car i really feel like i don t deserve this car i really can t believe that i could afford it i got this car ten years ahead of schedule i love this car so much that i ve been telling my parents to look into buying one i love this car so much that i wrote this k file i meant to write a couple of lines and ended up with this if there were a j d powers survey for used car owners i would have an opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this car i don t like thinking about getting another car but at this point in time i m sure i d buy another sho for under you can t beat it next time with an airbag and abs though insurance wise this car is also a big win i pay the same premiums as on my toyota celica despite that it has nearly twice the horsepower other odds and ends much to my amazement there is no sho mailing list anywhere maybe because the sho registry publication has filled this void i haven t joined yet but i ve noticed that queries about shos still appear on rec autos about once a month owners of shos are always quick to respond and are very vocal fans of the cars maybe some of the most vocal on rec autos i ve put together the responses to my questions about the cars as well as other posts with useful information on these cars i ll be posting this in the form of a faq soon if anyone is interested in starting a mailing list please speak up i don t know if i have the resources here at purdue to start one but maybe someone out there

review audi s quattro it s been a while since i ve reviewed a car but today i paid a visit to an old friend whose love for audis has been so overwhelming that he makes a not too sucessful living selling them without further delay i will get to the audi s servotronic steering for those who are not familiar with what servotronic is it is the name for the speed variable power steering manufactured by zf and used in audis and bmws i have been outspoken in my damming of servotronic over the past couple of months and this was based on magazine reviews and drives of the audi cs quattro and the audi cs fwd i am quite happy to report now that on the s the servotronic is inoffensive i suppose that due to the fat gumball tires the servotronic has been loaded up more and this so far has been the best implementation that i have tried it is far from perfect mind you and i d be much happier if it was an option that i could refuse but on the s i no longer consider this to be bad enough where i feel the entire car is ruined the steering is still a tad too light but it is accurate and i suppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information that some makes it through to the driver s hands so there is feel and there is accuracy in the s s steering but there is also room for improvement i consider the s s steering to be better than the japanese competition primarily because the japanese do not believe in feel and engineer it out completely engine wheee what a pressure cooker with just miles on the clock i did not expect the s to be producing anywhere close to what it will be putting out miles later but still the car packs a terrific punch for a turbocharged machine it is very unusual in that it encourages lazy driving i e low revs high gear it is so supremely flexible that one could hardly believe that there s only liters of displacement to move this pound car around in such a fashion with maximum torque available at rpm and a rpm redline the car can pretty much be left in third all day which translates to a speed range of something like mph a chracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity v s the technical achievement is breadthtaking throttle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine in fact it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame downshifts are almost unnecessary it is more fun to use the overboost feature than to rev the engine for those not familiar the s engine features up to seconds of additional turbo boost for passing sort of like lighting up the after burners in a jet fighter one could with the right foot only in third gear blast the car from to in just a few moments simply by flooring the gas as far as the numbers go maximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about lb ft incredible for a liter it takes a few moments for it to develop overboost but it is well worth waiting for since this is quite a heavy car one s body parts are not flung around like say the corrado vr the acceleration is smooth and strong somewhat similar to riding in a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff also one is treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from the turbo the only entertaining sound to come out of a very refined but bland sounding banger yes audi has refined the to the point where at rpm it sounds as serene as it does at the smoothness is outstanding but not quite up to the standards of a very good e g a valve bmw i d say that in terms of refinement i e willingness to rev smoothness lack of harshness under full acceleration it is better than many v s however lost in the refinement process is the characteristic cylinder bark that made the older engines so characterful if not terribly refined the valve turbo sounds pretty bland except for the whistle under full boost subjectively i d rate the vw vr engine as being far more musical than the turbo also audi s own v is also far more musical with a rorty race car growl when pressed though none of these can match its grunt the only hint of the engine s true capacity occurs when one is taking off from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop with the extra inertia from the permanently engaged wd system one has to be somewhat delicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall alternately one could use more revs in both cases a very small price to pay for such a fantastic engine i think that audi of america should offer an automatic option for this car just as they offer though in extremely small numbers a speed for the much peakier v the characteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic ironically in europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of the slush marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again chassis i ve noticed that audis tend to have very wide wheels and relatively modest tire widths the car comes with firestones of size zr which is not uncommon at all however the very attractive spoke wheels are no less than inches wide so there is no sidewall bulge whatsoever combined with the flared wheel arches the s has a mouth watering macho yet subdued look on rough concrete it becomes immediately clear that the new body style has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well as road noise suppression i suppose the two are inter related but i digress to use a cliche the s s body feels like it has been carved out of stone flex is totally undetectable even when going over rough roads with a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampers do not cause excessive harshness and while the s s ride quality will never worry a lexus it will also not draw comparisons to trucks or pony cars the servotronic steering has already been mentioned i consider it to be inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering i was able to test the car s cornering powers without too much trepidation i think a new concept is at work in this car with its fat gumball tires talking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless on a banked highway on ramp i went in slow and started applying power as i went around i could feel the g forces build to the point where the skin on my face was being tugged sideways yet the car was totally and completely obedient to throttle and steering inputs it felt that the limits were not even close to being approached the g forces were thrilling but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangely uninvolving you tell the car what you want and it does it end of story i think that i am starting to relate more and more to those reviewers who were highly impressed by the honda nsx s clinical efficiency but were unable to fall in love with the car the brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car pretty well too though i ve read that they are prone to fade i am not too surprised since the s does not have uprated brakes over the base audi fwd harder pads would help but that in turn would lead to a more wooden response when cold i am starting to see a trend among the luxury sports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset by additional braking capacity the ls s fade performance is nothing to brag about neither is the q s or the legend s brake fade these days seem to be a forgotten virtue when everybody s attention is focused on anti lock capability comfort for a car with such sporty abilities its comfort levels are also excellent the cabin is beautifully appointed with carbon fiber panel inserts in place of the wood trim of the s all the expected gizmos are there heated seats power seats seat memory power this and that the glaring ommision was the trip computer which was removed because audi hasn t gotten it to work reliably yet that means that the car has no boost gauge a real disappointment taking into account how much the turbo dominates its performance unusual for the germans the s comes with a honda style moonroof as well as the very intelligent dial a sunroof position rotary switch noise levels including engine and tire noise is so low that i wouldn t consider the lexus advantage in this area to be significant enough to sway a potential buyer conclusion even though few will be able to afford an audi s at its sticker price of k the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has to offer over the competition the valve turbo is a real gem even if it doesn t produce ferrari sounds no other luxury sports sedan maker offers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive which to some is worth the extra money all by itself the safety features are also top notch side impact standard compliant the very elegant automatic seat belt tensioners and the dual airbags the series audis have been outstanding in government crash tests it gets my thumbs up for being so overwhelmingly capable rather than being all out exciting and intoxicating eliot

re pennsylvania insurance limited tort option in my opinion the limited tort option is the best thing casey has ever done basically limited tort means that you give up your right to sue for pain and suffering unless one of the following conditions is met your medical bills resulting from the accident exceed x where x is some number like i m not sure of the exact number the accident was caused by a drunk driver i mean the other driver was drunk you get a good lawyer and have a good case basically you can appeal to regain your right to sue but there s almost no chance of this ever happening you are only giving up your right to sue for pain and suffering you can still sue for medical costs actual damages etc by agreeing to limited tort you are essentially giving up your right to be an asshole who treats every accident as an entry into the litigation lottery in exchange you get a substantial reduction in your rates i save year unfortunately the insurance companies have managed to scare and confuse people so much that only about of pennsylvanians go for limited tort i guess that s ok if more people opted for it the insurance companies would be pushing harder for repeal

re best radar detector valentine from article apr sequent com by troy sequent com troy wecker earlier i commented on the valentine and jimf centerline com replied about the value of the units bogey counter i didn t really go into why i called this feature a gimmick so here is more explanation thanks jim for the good comments and opinion from what i understand the valentine can only tell if these microwaves are coming from the front rear or both there are only two antennas if they are coming from both this in interpreted as a side bogey bogey counts are determined as sources by their relative strength to one another even if they are reflections of the same source it sounds like your analysis is based on hypothesis and not actually using the valentine i d like to give some feedback based on real life experince i keep the valentine in advanced logic mode and it rarely lights up as a christmas tree the only time it does is when i am in the middle of a major shopping area and then it makes sense that is does since there are sources coming from many different directions i have found the valentine to be consistent in its reporting of bogeys regardless of any moving cars in the area i have found the directional indication to be very useful in one case there was two radar traps set up within one mile of each other as i passed the first radar trap the direction indication changed then the detector was set off again pointing in the forward direction with other radar detectors i would have assumed that this was due to a reflection but with the valentine i knew there was a high probability that there was another trap and there was on other occasions the directional helped discern a false alarm from a true alarm for example as i pass a source the direction indicator changes the directional also allows me to focus my attention as to where the signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the place when a car is approaching me from the rear with a detector that leaks i can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as the car passes me i can verify the source with other detectors i would have been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radar trap when there was none i ve had the valentine for several months now and find its added features to be useful and not gimmicks barry barry frishberg blf apollo ch hp com chelmsford uk expert center tn chelmsford ma

re what is the deal with blue book value of an auto mail bounced so in article apr news eng convex com you write i am in the process of buying a new auto i haven t decided yet whether i should sell my current car myself or trade it in as part of the new auto purchase traditional wisdom says you are almost certainly better off selling it yourself if you don t mind that extra hassle having a trade in on a purchase just makes getting the best price from a dealership more confusing i know that the blue book value for the car is i assume this is retail bluebook there are two bluebook prices one for retail and one for wholesale you really want the retail price if you can get it the blue books also have adjustments you can make for low mileage and extras on your particular car you should look all this stuff up yourself also keep in mind that the blue book prices are averages over the country that may not apply in your area for example blue book prices are low for california a better way of finding out how much your car might be worth is to call around and see what it s selling for if any used lots have one or looking in local papers for similar cars and checking out the prices it might be more time efficient to take a small loss rather than hold out for months for the best price an acquaintence has offered to give me blue book value for the car i don t know what you mean by an acquaintance but i would make darn sure that i was paid that is cashier s check in full before delivery there s a real temptation when selling to a pseudo friend to be more accomodating than you should make sure you get the money and if they hedge about paying in full at the start with a cashier s check or cash then i would go elsewhere rememeber that you can probably sell your car to a used car lot or wholesaler and get wholesale bluebook that s probably a safer approach than selling to a private party alan mountain dew and doughnuts ames elroy alan because breakfast is the most important meal alan elroy jpl nasa gov of the day

re the mustang you know i m a ford fan i must say so i m looking forward to the next mustang i have faith that it will be a fine product more desireable than the camaro is now you know that s mho true thats your opinion they beat ford to the market with the camaro firebird but really only in words production of these vehicles will be limited until the end of the year keeping selling prices above msrp for the most part since there are so many twitching camaro fans out there i wouldn t press ford to hurry the mustang since the final wait could be worth it besides no bow tie fanatic is gonna buy the mustang anyway true again i wouldn t take a free mustang honest the next mustang will be ford s highest profile car it attracts way more attention than the camaro firebird because it s heritage is more embedded in the general public don t lie to yourself and believe ford will forfeit that fyi they already did too bad that the current mustang can t even compete with the new camaro without using an active imagination right now few cars can compare with the camaro think about it for a car that will out perform all but a few exotics if you are now swearing at me look at the stats they don t lie there are no comparable cars in it s class certinaly not for its price you know intelligent critical spews like the mustang bites man some of you are already beginning i predict that the mustang and camaro will be comparable performers as usual i also agree this subject is one that will never be setteled except maybe at the track unless the ford gets the v hp romeo you don t seriously believe that it was designed for the mark viii only do you hey can you imagine the potential of a modified lt folks in a few years we will surpass the levels of performance achieved in the late s thats scary you ford vs chevy people must live in the planet of detroit or droid like they say in the airforce with enough horsepower anything will fly i can put a valve v with twin garret s on yugo and get sec qm thats useless its still a yugo that will loose any race on a track or on the street have you detroit beings compared the ultra long throw stick shifts of the with the mr turbo or rx i ll buy it in mos or the torsen differential of the rx compared to the differential of the that sounds in every hairpin turn and bythe way and camaro both have drums on the rear breaks hello this is the s vlasis theodore software engineer just say no to signatures

re viper car alarms in article c fr cdo cs uiuc edu u cs uiuc edu ronald e garnett writes hello auto enthusiasts i recently had more car mangled broken into and decided to get an alarm installed it s a viper and has a shock sensor sensors for each door ignition cutoff and automatic door locks i have this same alarm installed in my syclone it works great the shock sensor is very sensitive but much more practical than the motion sensor i have on my other car it doesn t trigger if the car is rocked gently by the wind but any kind of shock sets it off even kicking the tire sets it off it works great what worries me is the hood and hatch if someone could pry them up gently enough then they could bypass the alarm the shock sensor is adjustable and there are two cycles on it you can adjust it to be sensitive enough that there is no way you could open the hood without setting off the alarm although i know that you cannot pop the hood on the syclone without setting off my alarm now and yet i have had zero none false alarms with this system the alarm tells you when you disarm it whether it has been activated in your absence i have been able to trace every alarm to it s cause and it was not a false alarm i m also wondering how easy it would be for a thief to crawl underneath the car and cut the battery cable to disable the alarm i guess it would be possible depending on the vehicle my syclone is so tight in the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this there are supplemental power supplies you can put on with this viper alarm but i don t have one i really think that if someone wants my car that bad the alarm won t keep them from it even with a supplemental power supply viper also sells some fancy field disturbance sensor that supposedly detects people approcahing the car this is primarily for convertibles i have a convertible and have looked at this feature in detail alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you want to get one of these it has zones in it that can be shut down independently so that if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else that would trigger an alarm it shuts down the zone or rather pulls it in tighter i don t see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that you leave the top down on avoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package it talks to people as they walk by i saw one installed on a lotus esprit the kids would taunt it seeing how close they could get before it warned them to get back the owner finally disabled it which defeats the purpose in my mind i m interested in the opinions of you netters about these problems and about the viper in general i am real happy with my viper one other feature i really like is you can tune it to your preferences you can have it arm passively or not you can disable the chirp for arming disarming you can have it lock unlock the doors when the alarm is armed disarmed i like these features i hate the chirp when the alarm arms disarms so mine flashes the lights only i like the door lock feature although i have to be careful to take my keys with me because it doesn t know if you have left your keys in the car when it passively arms and locks the doors but if you are meticulous about taking your keys with you it takes care of the rest the car is an ford probe gt that used to be in great shape ron garnett i looked seriously at the alpine system too it is a real nice system but more money and it has a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor the shock sensor is better and the viper shock sensor is better cycle than the optional alpine one imho i think the viper gives you a lot of good value for the money but it isn t absolutely tamperproof no system is except maybe the one that james bond had on his lotus in for your eyes only anyone know where we can get one of those installed maybe that was what they had in the van in the world trade center huh merrill

re questions about insurance companies esp geico wrat unisql uucp wharfie writes my car was recently destroyed in a hail storm i fully expected to get jerked around by the insurance company i wasn t the only one who had hail damage state farm opened its claim centers on evenings and weekends and flew down additional adjusters from dallas i have no experience with state farm but i think it s important to differentiate your experience from a typical accident hail damage is clearly not the fault of the owner and also tends to be well publicized in the media so it s to the ins co s benefit to respond promptly and helpfully damage like this doesn t imply anything about the likelihood of future claims unless you live in an area that gets frequent damaging hail storms so there s no reason for them to stop covering you that s a lot different from at fault accidents or theft related claims which may be more indicative of claim patterns

re service indicator of a bmw dchan cisco com derek chan writes in article apr westminster ac uk jkjec westminster ac uk shazad barlas writes derek there is a tool available to reset the service indicator on bmws but the lights will come back on after weeks the tool is in fact illegal in europe atleast it is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a used bmw and a few weeks later all the lights come on other than that i know of no other tool anyone else shaz hmm but the service indicators that i have works this way there are green yellow red indicators initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start your car the computer will actually sense how you drive your car and as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go on and you should get service when by the time green indicators are off after service the mechanic or you will reset the service indicators and the computer starts counting again so i expect to have a tool or a procedure to reset it so the green lights will come on and the yellow and red lights will go off i wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset the indicator it s the first european car i have and changing oil at miles is a surprise to me and it s a big plus but i wonder how that could happen since the oil lose its lubrication ability over time i thought it s the oil and not the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil any bmw owner on the net response welcomed ps my initial question is how do you seset the service indicator of a bmw derek there is a perfectly legal tool available to reset the bimmer service lights it will cost you from a mailorder and buying one far outweighs the possible consequences of destroying all the electronics if you try di it yourself you wonder how people do an oil change without knowing how it reset why is reseting so important the only reason for doing it is stop the annoyance of a red light staring at you forget this in european cars you only need to change the oil every crap anyone serious about keeping their engine in good shape and extending its life will change it every inc filter don t wait for the servive lights to come on before servicing the car i bought a bmw about months ago it had green lights on i have changed the oil every completly flushed brake fliud changed all filters oil air and fuel changed transmission and drive oils and done almost all of the other things req for service and a service after nearly miles i am still on green lights after a winter in burlington and it is snowing today that is not bad good luck blair blair e robertson a new zealander in vermont university of vermont posting his own ideas medical research facilty smooth muscle ion channel group colchester vermont email blair northpole med uvm edu telephone

re manual xmission advice needed i don t think that a transmission fluid change will solve your problem unless you are in an extremely cold climate and using a very heavy weight fluid follow the manufacturer s recommended oil weight some of the cars i have had all standard transmissions or speeds recommend changing the transmission fluid at miles under normal driving conditions i ve gone without changing the transmission oil and had to replace the transmission bearings my older cars used weight oil whereas my honda uses motor oil or maybe weight
re changing brake fluid is it necessary i agree with jeff s reply i ve never changed the brake fluid except when having a brake job which is usually at around miles alot of freeway driving however i will start to do this as preventative maintenance on my new car also there are brake system flushing agents that can be used but the problem is that if any of the agent is left in the system it can cause problems so it s been recommended not to use them unless you are certain that you can remove all of the flushing agent just for your info i was quoted a price of labor and fluid for flushing the brake system this in conjunction with a break job so i don t know if it was more without the brake job this is in the s f bay area

re best radar detector valentine in article apr sequent com troy sequent com troy wecker writes let me explain why i feel the bogey counter feature is a gimmick radar waves bounce off objects especially metal that is how radar speed measurement works a high frequency microwave x band approx ghz and k is approx ghz is sent out and reflected back to the antenna off of an automobile or other objects if an object is moving a doppler shift about hz per mph on x band occurs is measured and converted to miles per hour these waves bounce all over the place and they can reflect many times and go in many directions from what i understand the valentine can only tell if these microwaves are coming from the front rear or both there are only two antennas if they are coming from both this in interpreted as a side bogey bogey counts are determined as sources by their relative strength to one another even if they are reflections of the same source i m certainly no engineer and really have no scientific basis on which to make this argument but don t you answer your own question is the reflected signal shifted at all from the act of being reflected if so wouldn t it then be easy for the detector to discriminate between reflections and direct sources here is the problem since the microwaves reflect how does the unit tell if it is a source or a reflection take a valentine and drive to the local grocery store that uses an x band radar door opener you can tell by the small black box above the door pointed down at about a degree angle and your detector going off when it gets near the valentine will count or bogeys from all directions front rear and sides it doesn t say which side the count changes as cars drive by and reflections change is there or sources not at the store i go to as i drive around with a standard detector i can only find one source and that is the door opener for the front door troy wecker troy sequent com sequent computer systems beaverton or david w hwang m d david ganglion ann arbor mi us

exhaust coating since at least one other person was interested in this my fzr s black exhaust pipes are rusty and i researched getting them repaired yesterday i bought a can of vht degree black header paint and spent an hour sanding two of the header pipes by hand sprayed on paint thought about how clean i was able to get the metal with sanding and determined that i wouldn t be at all suprised if the paint wore chipped off in a month soooo call a couple of places up in minneapolis and discover that powder coating while extremely durable will not handle over degree temperatures the place i talked to said they were experimenting with some new powder that is supposed to handle degrees but that it wouldn t be available for months at least they directed me to another shop that specializes in header coating the other shop said they have coatings available one is aluminized that can do degrees and is comparable to powder coating for durability the other is silicon i think based and can do degrees but is thinner and not as durable both coatings have a textured finish not super smooth and should be cleaned with hot water and a brush price for foot header pipes and a foot collector was i m planning to take the parts up friday and get them back ups next week maybe wednesday sounds to me like this kind of coating stuff should be way better than paint considering how much abuse the pipes get from road crap rocks axel

kawi kz partial engine disassembly my kawasaki kz l has millimetres of play on the gearchange pedal axle in other words i can move the axle sideways up and down for few millimetres to each direction this doesn t bother me when riding but i guess fixing it wouldn t hurt last summer i took the bike to a shop to have the valves adjusted and the mechanic mentioned that it should be an easy job all i would have to do is to remove the front sprocket cover and replace a bushing or a seal that i would find there well upon a closer inspection i discovered that the gearchange axle doesn t even run through the sprocket cover it seems that in addition to removing the cover i would have at least to remove the sprocket and then the cover that is behind the sprocket question would removing this small cover from the left side of the engine enable me to lay my hands on that bushing seal don t know the exact term in english sorry question has anybody done this disassembly job for this or some other purpose does the oil for example stay inside the engine thanks teppo nieminen dod zoo mc helsinki finland

re need advice for riding with someone on pillion rwert well sf ca us bob wert writes are there traditional signals for slow down or go faster or i hafta go pee etc my experience is when they pound their fists on your back it means slow down seriously concentrate on being very smooth and you will make her experience much more enjoyable even a normal upshift causes your passenger to bob so i ease off the throttle before pulling in the clutch to eliminate this it s more work but your passenger will appreciate it also i ve found that using more rear brake than normal helps keep the bike from diving as much during routine stops which makes it much easier for the passenger to hang on if you re going sport riding have the passenger reach around you and brace themselves against the tank so you don t have to bear both your weights with your arms again your bike will dive less too paul thompson apple computer

re bmw heated grips orating with wild abandon prange nickel ucs indiana edu henry prange offers the grips on my gs are a wonderful thing in the winter and no problem in the summer vibration bmw s don t vibrate everyone knows that i d agree with henry the grips are really nice to have in winter and aren t noticably different from normal grips in summer my only complaint is that the low setting might as well be off this has been complained about by every reviewer official and unofficial that s ever talked about these grips the high setting is often too high for use with lightweight summer gloves when things just get a bit nippy but since low doesn t produce a noticable effect i end up turning the grips on and off to keep the temperature about right this generally isn t a problem when wearing thicker winter gloves when i asked the dealer if they could fix it i received a consoling pat on the back and their sincere apologies for the poor design actually i was told they worked just like they were suppose to vibration what s that i ride a bmw twin you can barely tell if the engine is fired up or not most of the time smoother than silk sheets ken wallich wallich ncd com ken wallich com kmw al org decwrl vixie amber ken
re where to put your helmet in article uupcb compdyn questor org ryan cousineau compdyn questor org ryan cousineau writes another good place for your helmet is your mirror i kid you not if you own a typical standard or other bike with fairly average mirrors that screw into your handlebars your helmet should fit over your mirror and be fairly stable be careful that you do not have any weight of the helmet resting on the mirror it will depress the foam liner in the helmet that is not the kind of foam that bounces back like foam rubber its purpose in life is to absorb energy in an impact as it is compressed by your noggin if your mirror compresses it there is that much less energy absorbing capacity left to cushon your noggin in a crash i found the right handlebar to be a good spot if on the sidestand hang with the chinbar facing up balanced across the grip and brake lever such that the weight of the helmet doesn t compress any of the chinbar foam this is more challanging with an open face helmet ed green former ninjaite i was drinking last night with a biker ed green east sun com and i showed him a picture of you i said dod go on get to know her you ll like her the grateful dead it seemed like the least i could do

re countersteering faq please post in article zen sys uea ac uk mjs sys uea ac uk mike sixsmith writes all of us that argue about gyroscopes etc throughly understand the technique of countersteering including all the ones who think that they countersteer all the way through a corner well all the way through a decreasing radius corner anyway this is really the only thing we disagree on maybe we should agree to disagree ok but i m right the official line here though i do have my doubts about it is that the front brake is applied first followed by the rear brake the idea being that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place if that s the official line taught in those rider education classes you were refering to that also don t teach countersteering i have to question the quality of the classes the official line in msf curricula is as i described maximum braking is achieved by applying both brakes equally when the weight distribution is nominally even and both tires have equal normal forces and easing off on the rear to prevent locking it and increasing braking on the front as more traction is available to the front due to increased normal force due to weight shift the official line you have been taught seems ineffective on the face of it applying the rear brake after the front is not taking advantage of all the traction available to the rear at time and is halving the available braking power by using only the front at time saying brake until the tire just begins to slide is next to useless advice to a newbie he has to go out and slide the tire to find out where that is it also gives him zero information from which to develop a braking technique that changes as the braking and corresponding weight shift develop if you don t slide the tyre you have no way of knowing whether you ve achieved maximum braking or not i m not suggesting that you should always aim to brake as hard as you possibly can but if you want to find the limits of the machine you have to go beyond them not necessarily true chirping the tire indicates impending lockup on most surfaces and serves as a good guide to newbies to indicate maximum braking i agree that totally locking the front occasionally makes one a better rider but it is a manuver best saved for an experienced rider unless you have one of those outrigger bikes like code used to use in any case for maximum braking if as i suggested you aim to keep both wheels just on the point of sliding then you ll be doing exactly as you suggest true but from the point of view of how to best teach riding skills which is how this discussion started keep both wheels just on the point of sliding is nearly useless information you need to teach a technique or at least a strategy to achieve this ed green former ninjaite i was drinking last night with a biker ed green east sun com and i showed him a picture of you i said dod go on get to know her you ll like her the grateful dead it seemed like the least i could do

squids and dealers yesterday a friend had asked me to accompany him to a local motorcycle dealer it has been a while since he last rode years and i myself have never bought a new bike from a dealer what follows is an experience of that visit and of an observation of squildly behavior by other customers and or sales personel background i ride with a group of friends who mainly are into cruiser type bikes my friend was hell bent on getting an intruder and had seen a few used ones he wanted to see what the new ones were going for so we happened upon a dealer that sold both suzuki and yamaha the place was fairly busy so we browsed a bit we happened upon a few intruders most of which had sold signs on my friend had been bitten well the salesdroid appeared and as my friend started chewing the fat i moseid on outside the next thing i know i see or sport bikes pull in i could stereo type the type of riders backward ball hat oakley iq but i won t well they went inside i didn t think much of it i figured to each his own i went back in to see if the salesdroid had his fangs firmly implanted into my friends back when i noticed the hormone gang talking to other salesdroids managers lot s of laughter jokes etc no big deal here is the part that concerned me the hg and those shop personel that were not busy with customers went back out where said hg members fired up their rides and did the obligatory reving up of those beasts at this point one decided to see how much rubber a katana could deposit in the drive squids i thought to myself but i was appalled that the salesdroids manager not only condoned this behavior but encourged it to the point were they were betting how long he could keep it up and egged him on to pull a wheely as he rode off onto a busy street around rush hour the girl that was riding pillion on another bike seemed rather hormonal about this display and urged her pilot to quickly catch up the others followed making sure there kerkers could be heard as well as felt i felt embarassed at this point to be a motorcyclist i felt the eyes of those in cages witnessing this display then glancing over to the dealers lot and damning all those on two wheels needless to say my friend felt a little uncomfortable and we left i will now turn off my frustration and go ride peacefully to clear my anger i only hope that the cop who is following me home has an open mind and doesn t associate me with them btw i can t afford a new bike

re jack morris in article apr ramsey cs laurentian ca maynard ramsey cs laurentian ca roger maynard writes not at all i am talking about morris winning with toronto last year you are about to launch into a fantasy about the red jays and how toronto would have done with viola on their team viola didn t play for toronto last year morris did the problem with your nihilistic approach roger is that it takes all the sense out of the game by your line of reasoning if a guy hits into a double play with one out and the bases loaded there s no point in saying that that was a bad thing to do if his team won anyway or speculating on what might have happened if things had gone otherwise so the double play is merely an event that happened in the course of a game that was eventually won or lost for unknown reasons after all any speculation involves constructing a fantasy about what would have happened but didn t roger do you ever worry that the next pencil you drop will fall to the ceiling instead or are you willing to consider empirical evidence teams go to the post season when they win more games than anybody else in their division if they don t make the post season they don t win the series will you agree that winning a division is a useful intermediate goal in ring collecting if so you must agree that winning games is a useful intermediate goal towards winning the division and our disagreements come when we consider how to win games in your viewpoint as expressed winning games happens for reasons that cannot be analyzed while many of us are thinking things like base runners are good outs are bad and therefore walks are better than double plays with the bases loaded you are thinking things like it s a team game so perhaps the double play will cause some mysterious team dynamics that will cause the team to win today the result is that it becomes impossible to say anything about individual players perhaps atlanta would have won the series with me playing left field after all perhaps in some way my knowledge and personality would have helped the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurt it therefore i could be an extremely valuable player did dave winfield have anything to do with the jays victory probably but how do you know if you replace him with andres galarraga perhaps the jays would have won perhaps they would have lost perhaps they would have defected to alpha centauri bearing in mind that the flying saucers would not have landed in mid season had winfield been dhing for toronto was babe ruth a good player he played on some ws winning teams but did he have anything to do with their success it is generally accepted that ernie banks was a good baseball player and jarvis brown and dan schatzeder weren t it seems to me that anybody who would deny this needs to provide the proof now we have observed things about baseball over the years both empirically and by looking at the rulebook it is necessary to score more runs than one s opponent to win the game so it would seem important to score runs and to prevent one s opponent from scoring runs are scored while a team is batting and an inning ends after the third out so it would seem that making outs is bad while hitting home runs is good players have tendencies to hit or pitch at certain levels and these are usually somewhat consistent from year to year we do use these statistics to predict winners and so do you to make some flat predictions barry bonds will have a higher obp slg than gene larkin this year the braves will finish ahead of the rockies in the standings the tigers will score more runs than the royals but will also give up more i would be astonished if any of these turned out to be false and i suspect so would you as a matter of fact i am pretty sure i can predict all the division winners this year given guesses per division and this is certainly better than random chance and almost statistically significant if you will admit that the rockies and mariners are unlikely to meet in the world series you must admit that there is some sort of way to measure likelihoods however fuzzy it is impossible for all other things to be equal so your fantasy is totally meaningless so how about real life person a robs a service station with two people in it using a automatic pistol gets and is convicted and sentenced for three years person b with a similar criminal record robs a service station with two people in it using a revolver gets and is convicted since they used two different types of handgun are comparisons totally meaningless say you drop a pencil to see if the gravity still works my cats are always testing this they don t trust me to pay the gravity bill on time you have never dropped a pencil at that exact time of the century before so all previous evidence is meaningless or would you be surprised if it flew out the window instead of hitting the desk david thornley who has no replica world series rings but does have tickets to the

re jack morris in article apr ramsey cs laurentian ca maynard ramsey cs laurentian ca roger maynard writes we cannot isolate the total contribution that any player at any position makes to his team s victory and since we cannot make that measure with complete confidence of objectivity and since there is no absolutely necessary reason to make that kind of subjective measurement i submit to you that it is pointless if a gm is trying to put together a winning team he might consider era he might consider attitude he might consider past performance in key situations but what he is looking for is not the player that he considers the best the gm is looking for the player he thinks can help his team win we cannot isolate completely roger but we can make a pretty good estimate i won t claim to split hairs and say that we can really measure who was better robby alomar or carlos baerga last year the difference is too close to call but larkin and lee clemens and morris the differences are too great there in your measure of the game why should a team that has just won it all ever replace a single player since they are now clearly best how can they do better yet every team can always find someplace where they beleive they can improve the team they can always find a player a little better than one they already have btw by my definitions the best player is the one who does the most things to help his team win i will allow that this could vary depending on who else is on the team by having aptitudes one team needs more than others baseball is a team game but it is made of individual talents it is absurd to judge the success or failure of an individual by the success or failure of his teammates whom he did not choose at least in most cases morris won last year because he played on a team with joe carter robby alomar tom henke juan guzman john olerud et al clemens lost because he was surrounded by such lesser performers as herm winninham luis rivera and jeff reardon to define the quality of the team as a sum of its components as i do albeit imperfectly is a lesser error than defining the quality of an individual as the mean quality of the team as my reading of your arguments suggests you do clay d

yankee thoughts yes everyone seems to be in agreement that the yankees are finally moving in the right direction they should finish over this year and maybe even be in the pennent race in august however i would take back a few moves the jim abbott trade i think abbott is not only an inspirational person but a great pitcher also he could win the cy young this year but he won t because the right side of the yanks infield isn t good enough so why was this not a good trade jt snow how many rookies have been able to step in and immediately have the impact that he has had so far on the angels i know it s early but if you ve seen this kid hit field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be a tremendous player the yanks should have kept him what about mattingly you ask well it s great that the yanks have taken care of him and remained loyal but he s years older than snow and just doesn t have the same bat speed as before his back injury it s a shame but as a yankee fan who wants to see the best yankee team i d take snow over mattingly at first the yanks also gave up two promising propects with snow for abbott besides with domingo jean brien taylor wickman militello and sterling hitchcock they are just loaded with propects i know abbotts only but this was too much to give up i believe george forced this trade because he believes and he s right that abbott will be a big hit in ny however i d like to see the yankees build a baseball team not an amusement show wade boggs i live in boston and like wade a lot but his career is winding down and i would rather see the yanks start to develop a long term solution i e hensley muelins russ davis velarde besides wade just doesn t have any range what a shame about charlie hayes huh spike owen see wade boggs i d much rather see them develop dave silvestri or whoever wade and spike next to each other in the infield is going to raise the yankee staff era point and these guys are on the down sides of their careers danny tartabull yes he s put up some tremendous numbers and it s nice to think about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year but he never is we should expect games max out of him meanwhile gerald williams is playing at columbus and paul o neil is playing left field i believe o neil led nl outfielders in assists last year and tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder what i m basically getting at is the yanks are moving in the right direction but are not ready to win a pennent this year they should at the gm level be planning for a or world series this means getting the younger players experience in the majors now so they will be ready in a year or two i m afraid that all this stuff wreaks of george steinbrenner certainly the boggs deal was all george it looks like george is planning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world series now the veterans are always available and can be added at any time like boston did this year develop the young players first then add the one or two veterans or in the yankees case just keep them let s all us yankee fans hope that george doesn t dismantle the terrific job stick and company have done building the yankee organization back into one of respect i m really afraid that he will trade whoever it takes to patch holes today relief pitching for example george must realize that the yankees rebuilding process is still one or two years away have patience george and we will all enjoy the future fire bucky and trade the kids and it s baseball hell for all loyal yankee fans for a long time sam i m not militello or millitello mandelbaum

mvp revisited tim shippert recently posted summaries of last year s defensive average stats in terms of the linear weights estimated run value of defensive performances compared to league average i ve combined those with my position adjusted mlv numbers to come up with first approximation total run values for players last year we can use these as a springboard for reconsideration of the mvp award major caveats these numbers include no defensive park adjustment so if san diego really is just a question of odd scoring or gopher holes in the infield that will cause some inaccuracies the offensive numbers are position adjusted but not park adjusted so we have to deflate some and inflate others to be fair finally we still don t know what to do about catchers and i have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contributions of tony phillips and bip roberts having said that there are still some surprises let s look national league first all numbers in total runs contributed over the season player offense defense total sandberg bonds walker justice daulton larkin grace as i see it these are the legitimate mvp candidates from last season if you deflate sandberg s offense a wee bit for playing in wrigley you get essentially a dead heat had bonds been his usual defensive self it wouldn t have been close but that apparently wasn t the case darren daulton needs or more defensive runs to make up the offensive difference and i couldn t tell you whether that s easy or impossible a good case could be made for any of sandberg bonds or daulton as top dude my personal vote bonds sandberg daulton walker justice in the american league player offense defense total ventura martinez b anderson thomas r henderson raines tettleton ok let s see a show of hands how many of you picked robin ventura as top player in the al last year i certainly didn t but i d have a hard time arguing against him at this point yes i know these numbers are only approximate but that s a big gap between him and the guy also those of you who thought rickey henderson stank last year are out of your minds once again there s a catcher in the ointment if calling a game is as important as it might be runs is easy to make up or give away take a guess folks i don t think we can do any better than that my personal vote excluding pitchers ventura tettleton anderson martinez henderson i m a big frank thomas fan but i have to admit to a bias in favor of balanced offensive defensive contribution which should have a higher leverage in w l record than an equal shift that is lots of offense with negative defense for the record carlos baerga roberto alomar forget it it s a wash let me also take this opportunity to admit that i was grossly wrong regarding don mattingly s defense this past season don recovered brilliantly from his weak and to end up with mattingly runs which is clearly an above average first baseman however it s still runs behind mark mcgwire runs behind frank thomas and runs behind john olerud on the other hand it s ahead of rafael palmeiro cecil fielder and every other al first baseman not yet mentioned david m tate dtate pitt edu greetings sir with bat not quick member iie orsa tims sabr hands not soft eye not discerning and in denver they call you a slugger the big catullus galarraga and compare you to my own mattingly

re rule book trivia in article io maine maine edu ryan robbins io maine maine edu writes if i were the manager i d argue that the runner was out of the base line since he was to the left of the first base line if the umps don t budge which they won t they nev er admit when they are wrong i d file a protest with the league rule k states it is interference by a batter or runner when in running the last half of the distance from home base to first base he runs outside the three foot line or inside to the left of the foul line and in the umpire s judgment interferes with the field er taking the throw at first base the key word in the rule is and a runner isn t out just for running out of the baseline he s out for interfering with the fielding of the ball or throw or fielding of the throw to first because the catcher opted to throw the ball over the batter runner s head there s no inter ference so what is your definition of interfering with the fielder taking the throw the rule book certainly doesn t have a definiton or clarification so it s possible to interpret the rule as saying that if the catcher has to alter his throw to avoid hitting the batter runner then again we have interference you know it seems that there is no way to apply this rule justly if the catcher or the pitcher say rob dibble for example throws toward first and hits the runner running inside the baseline the fielder takes the chance of being ejected therefore he probably would throw around the runner or your scenario above him you should note that in our american legion league which uses mlb rules we interpret the rule to say in this very circumstance there is interference per rule rstimets
re game length was re braves update umpires are not required to call time out just because a player asks for time only in extreme cases like dust in the pitcher s or hitter s eyes should an umpire call time the batter has seconds to get situated in the box and receive a pitch i m against putting a giant clock or any size clock for that matter up to count down seconds between pitches and the minute for warm ups but i think umpires should tell hitters to go to hell if they step out to get the sign or whatever and instruct the pitcher to pitch the same goes for pitchers umps should tell them to pitch or feint within seconds or a ball will be called that s the way it should be ryan robbins penobscot hall university of maine io maine maine edu

re a rooky question about the era thomas theiner thein damabus informatik rwth aachen de wrote hi there i m german and i have been into this mlb stuff since almost one year now there are many problems occuring for me one of them is the era statistic for pitchers what does it say era indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per nine inning game thus if a pitcher pitched innings and gave up earned run his inning equivelent perfomance would be earned runs thus his era is to compute the era you simply take the number of earned runs divided by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by era er ip an earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed to a fielding error more specifically if an error occurs that represented the third out all runs scored after the error are considered unearned runs earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base when the pitcher exited the game here are some examples if there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base if an error occurs that represents the third out all of the runs after this error and not counted as earned runs if a pitcher issues some base on balls walks and leaves the game before the inning is completed he is responsible for the people who were left on base if the those runners who were left on base score and the score was not a result of an error those eraned runs are attributed to the pitcher who left the game i hope this explains things for you joe

re game length was re braves update in article mzimmersc sllk ld netcom com mzimmers netcom com michael zimmers writes in article apr vax clarku edu hhenderson vax clarku edu writes nflynn wvnvms wvnet edu writes i agree with nick what s the big deal about long games if you want to watch baseball there s that much more baseball to watch and yes baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves first a longer game in no way suggests more baseball to watch unless you include watching the grass grow as baseball the lengthier games are so because of batters stepping out of the box pitchers taking longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers and pitching coaches until six or seven years ago i was an enthusiastic fan of nfl football last year i hardly watched a game what turned me off were the incessant interruptions to the continuity of the game a team scores minutes of commercials kickoff minutes of commercials three downs and a punt minutes of commercials aaaaarrrrgh earlier in this thread i commented on larussa and the a s whom i believe institutionalize slow play i don t mind the cat and mouse game with rickey on first in fact i rather enjoy it similarly i would enjoy the battle with listach or lofton or polonia on first what i object to is when such games are played with karkovice on first or when the game is a blowout i don t mind when the pitcher steps off the mound to gather his thoughts in a crucial situation or when a hitter steps out of the box to regain his concentration what i object to is when hitters and pitchers take such breaks at every opportunity when a game is exciting these little delays serve as tension builders and for me enhance the value of the experience of the game when the delays happen with regularity they become nuisances just like the commercial breaks in football i understand the nfl imposed a number of rule changes to speed up the games basically putting an onus on the officiating staff to move the markers and the ball to the spots faster that did not address the problem of the continuity of the game it may have appeased the sponsors and the networks but i would be amazed if it did anything to enhance the experience of the fans similary while some hour baseball games bore me to tears those are the ones where there is no continuity and the players are taking exasperatingly long periods to get ready for each pitch i doubt if anyone watching the braves giants game cared about gant stepping out i doubt if anyone watching that game would have found that pause to be anything but an opportunity to have their complete attention claimed by the drama that was present i would be totally opposed to any effort that would eliminate that aspect of baseball on the other hand i wish baseball had a commissioner that was powerful enough to sit down with alderson larussa duncan and explain that they are actually hurting the product of baseball by dragging their games out the way that they do i sure wouldn t mind a little arm twisting there the beastmaster mark singer mss netcom com

re relative value of players in kime apr mongoose torolab ibm com kime mongoose torolab ibm com edward kim writes in article c ro h lww world std com jle world std com joe m leonard writes before folks jump on me let me ask the net would the jays have won the al with a good pitcher from aaa in place of morris given his run support how about an average ml pitcher i can t believe that morris performance in the playoffs and series had a large positive impact on the jays performance i know it s very trendy nowadays to dump on morris but let s give credit where credit is due it is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the al east without morris well when you say without morris you have to mention an assumed replacement if the alternative to morris was letting cito gaston soft toss the ball underhand to the opposition every days then of course the blue jays wouldn t have won without morris if the alternative was replacement level then i think it would ve been very close and yes morris might ve made the difference if the alternative was frank viola the blue jays probably would have won more easily with viola last year when the team went for the month of august and all the other starters were being shelled and milwaukee was making a charge morris went with a pretty good era i can t remember exactly yes you can make the argument that the his presence prevented the team from collapsing in august also let s not underestimate the importance his innings to save the bullpen every fifth day if he didn t help us win the al east forget about the pennent and the world series those innings were probably helpful his run support was high runs but so was stottlemyer s runs and he won only games i do remember morris winning an inordinate number of and ballgames but this is to his credit he pitched only as good as he needed to be when he was up in a ballgame he just put it in cruise control and threw the ball up there and let the batters get themseleves out i hate this expression an inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down but morris being a veteran pitcher knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in baseball by saving himself he was able to reach back for that little extra i hate this too when the game was on the line well i think is complete bs what happened most of the time is that morris fell behind and the team came back and rescued him mostly this is because he s a lousy st inning pitcher and much better the rest of the way that the team can climb out of holes consistently and win them is not to morris credit it s to the team s credit furthermore while morris did exceed the w l percentage that would be projected from his runs allowed and run support he hasn t done this in previous years in fact his w l record in is a lot worse than what it projects to be with run support and runs allowed do you think he just came up with this ability in look at the postseason games he pitched decently in typical morris games morris gets behind team rescues him he s not responsible for that rescue and in both those games the team just didn t rescue him enough jack morris pitched as well as he did during much of the season in those games the offense just didn t earn him a victory btw i think he should be put in the bullpen it would be embarrassing a veteran pitcher which cito would never do but his era is how much more can he be embarrassed morris is one of those guys who will reture when he can t start anymore he s too bad a first inning pitcher to serve in the bullpen greg

re game length was re braves update mzimmers netcom com michael zimmers writes first a longer game in no way suggests more baseball to watch unless you include watching the grass grow as baseball i definitely do that s why i don t like going to see games played on artificial turf the lengthier games are so because of batters stepping out of the box pitchers taking longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers and pitching coaches and while it s true that the gaps between plays can be interesting this is only true when they don t become extra long well your idea of interesting differs from mine i think batting practice is interesting for example and make a special effort to get to the game very early in order to see it i think the delaying tactics of batters pitchers catchers and managers are interesting because they re attempts to gain advantage through control of the flow and timing of the game of course the umpires can and should intervene when these tactics get out of hand as ryan robbins has pointed out there are rules that cover this one of the more fascinating things about baseball i think is its open endedness with regard to time you never know if the game is going to zip right by and be over in less than two hours or if it s going to go on until four in the morning likewise some games are action packed and some games are slow and lazy that s fine by me those folks who want constant action should watch the games on tv so they can channel surf and cater to their short attention spans heather hhenderson vax clarku edu

re why is barry bonds not batting th i like the clark williams bonds order pitchers can only walk clark with outs unlike last year williams is getting better pitches to hit with bonds looming in the on deck circle since matt has a terrible batting eye this helps the giants a lot when bonds gets on base all by himself he can try to steal nd and then be driven in with a single by thompson manwaring or clayton if you bat bonds before the other sluggers then you don t want him to run because a caught stealing could take you out of a big inning also bonds is less in need of protection behind him because he is such a good base stealer a walk is a potential double the only draw back is when clark and williams are clogging up the bases infront of bonds and i think that s a problem the giants will be glad to see especially if robby thompson gets hot ken kubey kubey wpd sgi com

re jack morris maynard ramsey cs laurentian ca roger maynard writes we have no way of knowing because we cannot separate morris contribu tion from the rest of the team s there is only one way of determin ing best in baseball and that is by looking at the scoreboard at the end of the game each game determines which team is the best that day at the end of the season the team that was the best the most often is the best in the division the playoffs determine the best of the best but the point is that the only decision making pro cess used to determine the best is the score of the game and it re lates to the teams not the individual players there is no method inherent in baseball of comparing individual performances and that is how it should be because after all baseball is a team game and you know what there is no such method inherent in real life either so i would assume you would endorse the notion that we cannot state with any level of objectivity that mother theresa has accomplished more good in this world than joseph stalin after all life on earth is a team effort if you want to select a group of statistics and claim that clemens has done better with those statistics as a criteria then fine but you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the individual s contribution to winning the ws because that is the only measure of best that has any meaning in the context of base ball so until you can prove that clemens contributes to a ws cham pionship more than morris your evaluation of clemens is totally sub jective and is mere opinion i have yet to see that any of you can predict a ws winner with any greater accuracy than jeanne dixon have you tried glasses i find them quite useful after all there must be some reason you choose to ignore the mounds of evidence we present it s too bad you feel it necessary to close your mind and eyes to knowledge you live a poorer life as a result of that choice heck i d wager that you could predict a ws winner with greater accuracy than jeanne dixon and you know why because i have full confidence that despite your protestations to the contrary you are quite capable of using the knowledge we can come up with through statistical methods to boost your knowledge level you don t have to be rude have you tried calling a kettle black for you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point of my argument or you yourself have committed a fallacy ignoratio elenchi i am not saying that morris is better than clemens because he has more rings although i have tongue in cheek claimed that in the past i am saying that it is impossible to isolate an individual s performance from that of his team s for the purpose of comparing that individual s performance with another individual s per formance in other words in your world you cannot objectively state that jack morris was more important to the blue jays than al leiter last year in your world that may indeed be true fortunately in the world the rest of us occupy it s not i hope you never serve on a jury roger i think the rest of the jury would have to kill you there s no way i can objectively judge the defendant to be innocent or guilty you see there are billion other people on this planet we have no way of knowing whether the defendant would have committed the crime if it wasn t for all the other people on the planet we have no way of knowing how the defendant would have acted had he been on a different planet because living on this planet is a team effort and no individual committs a crime totally isolated from his society he is a part of that society that being case anything i have to say on his culpability would be absolute subjectivity so i refuse to vote greg

re mvp revisited in article r hf innc gap caltech edu tim shippert writes ideally dhs should be the strongest offensive players because any schmoe can play dh if he can hit that would take care of position corrected anomolies such as frank s since that is not the case and why not is it always this way then we are going to have trouble finding the true value of dhs using the same models as that for position players there are several reasons for this difference the main reason is that good hitters in their prime such as frank thomas and danny tartabull are rarely regular dh s even if they can t field it s more commonly a place to put aging veterans another use of the dh slot is to help a player come back from injury slowly getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the field i would expect such players to hit worse as dh s than they did during the rest of the season a third factor is that most player who split time between dh and first or the outfield don t hit as well as dh s for some reason reggie jackson was a good example in five years as a rf dh for the angels he hit like the old reggie when he was in right the second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by their primary position only a player who plays games in right and at dh will count only in the right fielders averages a logical starting place would be to look at defensive replacement value if you can find it for b or lf or something we can assume that if forced to play defense they would play at true zero value even though i doubt this is actually true for players like winfield and molitor this would let us discount the time they spend playing dh because that forces the team to find another real fielder to play this makes sense you might also look at it another way although the average offensive performance of a dh may be lower than for a left fielder the replacement level offensive performance is certainly lower if you are a left fielder but can t hit well enough to keep a job anywhere then you certainly can t hit well enough to keep a job at dh david grabiner grabiner zariski harvard edu we are sorry but the number you have dialed is imaginary please rotate your phone degrees and try again disclaimer i speak for no one and no one speaks for me
re bases loaded walk gives reds win in in article apr cs cornell edu tedward cs cornell edu edward ted fischer writes in article mssc xb i cg netcom com mss netcom com mark singer writes sigh here we go again actually several scdn s stated that there were no definable skills that would make a hitter more likely to perform better in clutch situations vs non clutch situations however one might choose to define clutch right can you define such a skill must i if i were to say that batting average is a predictor that can be used to judge which of two hitters is more likely to get a hit on a particular plate appearance is that only valid if i can define the skill in hitting a baseball that s all i ve said except i used the smaller sample of batting average in clutch situations and elsewhere on this thread sherri nichols repeats her position that batting average in clutch situations is a meaningless statistic for predicting the future it has been entirely meaningless at least if it has meaning we don t know how to find it i did not say i could predict the future i ve suggested that the statistic is not necessarily meaningless here s the data for this situation non clutch clutch ab h ba ab h ba sabo samuel if you were to have been the reds manager at that time i assume you would have had some basis for letting sabo hit rather than pinch hitting samuel i m sure some of that basis would have utilized prior performance you just wouldn t have used this particular aspect of prior performance is this not correct i ll try to avoid being insulting but it s difficult when you so cavalierly dismiss hundreds of hours of work with an i don t pretend to understand but nobody is denying that there are people who have hit well in the clutch in the past but i challenge you to find a method to predict who will hit well in the clutch in the future which after all is what you are claiming you can do since one more time i did not claim to be able to predict the future i said that i accept the above data as an indication that samuel would have had a better chance for success in that situation than sabo and i am not dismissing your work i m stating my opinion you are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary invalid so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult to your work fine we have plenty of data obviously our preconceived biases must be coloring our work since you know clutch hitting is a well defined and consistent skill all of our failures not withstanding so i challenge you to prove it i guarantee you that if you can prove the existance of some form of clutch ability you will have plenty of happy sdcns dancing around you i did not say that clutch hitting is well defined i said that the data is significant to me i did not say that it is a consistent skill i have said that it is an indicator of performance under a certain set of circumstances but you aren t going to win any support by merely stating a position and claiming they are stupid so i must be right and big sigh i have not not not not not not not ever called you or anyone else on r s b stupid it is nice however to see that you will consider the possibility that you actually could have some preconceived biases yeah hindsight is always doesn t that make you bright this is a stupid argument and you know it ah i knew we could get to the name calling and there s that word you like so much a suggestion take data from and attempt to come up with some method that predicts who hit well in the clutch in if that works we can then attempt to apply it to and beyond wait a minute i thought i first had to define clutch hitting do i or don t i you have made strong statements now back them up or be proven a total idiot i made two statements in my post i am not convinced of your conclusions regarding clutch hitting i would have hit for sabo as for many of us make a number of written statements through this media about what we think will happen in baseball i m not shy about it i ll make the statement again i believe that by season s end that chris sabo s batting average in clutch situations will be significantly lower than his batting average in non clutch situations i can t prove that it will happen so i guess we ll just have to wait and see here s another one for you in joe carter s batting average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting average in non clutch situations each year i presume you think this is random non clutch ab h clutch ab h so what could we expect in from mr carter well his composite ba through was through was through was so i think we have a pretty good idea of what kind of batting average he can produce in he hit not surprising huh also in non clutch ab h clutch ab h no this doesn t prove any overall statistical trend that can be used to predict future performance across the breadth of major league ballplayers it just makes me think that in joe carter s batting average in the clutch is not going to be as high as his ba in non clutch situations as for above i have plenty of company john dewan of stats inc is the editor of the scouting report wherein the statistics regarding clutch hitting are compiled reported and referenced in the text bill james makes numerous references to a player s ability to hit well in the clutch i am not saying that i can predict the future any more than they are you and others are saying that your work renders their statements and mine meaningless i don t accept that which in your words proves that i am a total idiot stupid total

again you started it for predicting the future it has been entirely meaningless at least if it has meaning we don t know how to find it i did not say i could predict the future you most certainly did non clutch clutch ab h ba ab h ba sabo samuel sabo is clearly a better hitter than samuel yet you would pinch hit samuel because you predict that samuel will be a clutch hitter and sabo will be a choke hitter right i d call that predicting the future if you were to have been the reds manager at that time i assume you would have had some basis for letting sabo hit rather than pinch hitting samuel i m sure some of that basis would have utilized prior performance you just wouldn t have used this particular aspect of prior performance is this not correct right i would have used aspects of prior performance which have been shown to be consistent in the past overall performance l r splits even matching hitting pitching styles all of these will give me some advantage if used properly even if all else were equal there would be no advantage gained by looking at past clutch performance and in this case everything else pointed to sabo one more time i did not claim to be able to predict the future i said that i accept the above data as an indication that samuel would have had a better chance for success in that situation than sabo that comes down to the same thing when perez left sabo in he was predicting the future the next ab he was predicting that sabo was more likely to get a hit than samuel by supporting the swap you are predicting the opposite and i am not dismissing your work i m stating my opinion you are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary invalid so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult to your work well yes you are aware of its existance you claim to be incapable of understanding it though i suspect you are simply unwilling yet you rather forcefully state the opposite you don t seem to think the work is worth reading yet you obviously feel the topic is important i d say this is insulting i did not say that it is a consistent skill i have said that it is an indicator of performance under a certain set of circumstances right this is the beef it has not proven to be an indicator of future performance under any circumstances at least none that we ve been able to come up with if you know of some where it is an indicator of future performance please let us in on your secret it is nice however to see that you will consider the possibility that you actually could have some preconceived biases most certainly as i have repeatedly stated if you can come up with a study which even hints at a consistent clutch ability i would love it however the straightforward attempts at such a study have all failed miserably yeah hindsight is always doesn t that make you bright this is a stupid argument and you know it ah i knew we could get to the name calling and there s that word you like so much well it was a stupid argument are you honestly debating that sure we know sabo didn t get a hit we have no idea whether samuel would have done any better or not one ab most certainly doesn t prove anything i believe that by season s end that chris sabo s batting average in clutch situations will be significantly lower than his batting average in non clutch situations i can t prove that it will happen so i guess we ll just have to wait and see is this simply a prediction for chris sabo for this year or is this a prediction for all batters who have over the past few years hit xxx amount worse in the clutch than overall if you mean the first then as you say we ll just have to wait and see but the second is a much stronger statement in fact it suggests a rule we can then test this rule on past data to see if it worked for recent years i think you will agree that if the rule didn t work last year or the year before that it is unlikely to do any better this year right here s another one for you in joe carter s batting average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting average in non clutch situations each year i presume you think this is random i m not going to get into case analysis sure you can find somebody who hit poorly from and then hit poorly in as well you can also find those who hit poorly from and then hit well in no this doesn t prove any overall statistical trend that can be used to predict future performance across the breadth of major league ballplayers it just makes me think that in joe carter s batting average in the clutch is not going to be as high as his ba in non clutch situations gambler s fallacy unless there is reason to expect consistency a run proves nothing can you give us a reason to expect clutch ba to correlate from one year to the next i ve seen a detailed study of why i shouldn t expect it to correlate stupid total idiot my my such hostility the stupid was in reference to a statement which was stupid and i don t see how you can deny it

good hands was re apology for article in article c w zo xl eskimo com stevet eskimo com steven thornton writes stuff deleted mattingly scores badly on both counts he doesn t get to very many balls and he lets a lot of balls go through the fact that he looks smooth has great hands and makes few errors means nothing this is traditional brainless reliance on observations that can easily be misled like a lot of bad fielders mattingly actually makes himself look better by not having any range he s nowhere near as bad as steve garvey but that s not much of a compliment i agree with the flavor of this post but disagree with one specific argument that has great hands means nothing it seems to me that a first baseman s defensive value is not entirely or even primarily from his ability to field grounders or catch popups how many such chances does he get during a game many fewer than he gets chances to catch throws from b ss b and p i mean the total of these is much higher than grounder popup totals this implies to me that there is value in catching these throws well even if they are high up the line or in the dirt good hands are needed for such plays and thus have value i don t have any numbers for the relative number of occurences of these plays but i d guess that the values of these abilities are similar it s just like you don t judge catcher s defense primarily on how they field bunts and popups but not as marked i suppose michael

the braves will come around to all the braves doubters don t worry the bats will come alive and the braves will come around the pitching is solid and as long the braves don t have serious injuries to the starting rotation they ll continue to pitch well heck with the five starters on the braves rotation they could even sustain an injury to one of the five i hope this doesn t happen though the bats are there pendleton will certainly bat over justice is catching fire bream nixon sanders gant well there s too much offense there to be kept quiet for much longer right now the cleveland indians have players batting over but i certainly wouldn t their seven for our respective seven though wouldn t the braves be something right now with their pitching and players batting over the bullpen well it is suspect but when the bats come alive the guys in the bullpen will be of less concern so anyway i believe the braves will be tough to beat this season i m not saying the braves have automatically won the division but i m optim istic about their season though it s awful painful to watch them at times right now go braves dean

re bases loaded walk gives reds win in in article mssc y u dn netcom com mss netcom com mark singer writes actually i think the large scale sample size is part of the problem it seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball in regard to ba vs clutch ba deviation we would get some kind of bell curve the x axis being the deviation in clutch hitting vs non clutch the y axis being the number of players certainly there would be some players on the extreme ends of the bell right most definitely my supposition is that if we were to find the same players consistently year after year at one end of the bell or the other then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusions about those players as opposed to all baseball players this may be the root of the confusion please consider the following hypothetical with an open mind note that i am not yet saying that it has anything to do with the question at hand suppose we have a simplified lotto game you pick a number from and win if that number is drawn suppose we have a large population of people who play this game every week in the first year of the game approximately of the population will win or more times in the second year of the game of those time winners will again be time winners in the third year of the game of those who won or more times in each of the first two years will win again suppose i started with people in my population after three years i have people who have consistently in each of the last three years won or more the number of times expected do we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game no because we know there is no skill involved nothing about these consistent winners can influence their chances of winning but suppose we don t know whether or not there is a chance that skill might be involved perhaps some of the people in our population are psychic or something how would we test this hypothesis we can look for correlations in the population now most of the population will show zero correlation but our psychics should show a high positive correlation even if they aren t very good psychics they should still manage to win or more times most years net result a small positive correlation over the entire population this probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement i am having with others on this topic must any conclusion based on statistical history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before it has any validity is it impossible or irrational to apply statistical analysis to selected components of the data base well zero correlation is zero correlation you mention that sabo has hit poorly in the clutch over the last years but if we look at the past we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse as they are to remain consistent the length of the streak doesn t seem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be clutch or choke the next year is there any reason to expect this streak to be different from past streaks now if it were true that of all three year streaks remained true to form then we might have something useful but then we wouldn t have zero correlation instead we have of all three year streaks remain true to form and of all three year streaks reverse you look at those numbers and say three year choke streak implies more likely to choke this year but it would be equally valid to look at those numbers and say three year choke streak implies more likely to be clutch this year since the probabilities are split each way i completely accept that reasoning again what if we were to find the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent basis then we would have something useful and we would also have a positive correlation but for every individual that exhibits such a pattern and holds true there is another who exhibits such a pattern and then reverses cheers valentine
teams as organisms stats or stats was re jack morris note i m not posting this as part of an argument with roger meynard but as an independent sort of thread i do actually quote some things that roger meynard wrote but it might be better to think of this as sampling his post in the hip hop sense because it fits in with what i want to say maynard ramsey cs laurentian ca roger maynard writes but the point is that the only decision making pro cess used to determine the best is the score of the game and it re lates to the teams not the individual players there is no method inherent in baseball of comparing individual performances and that is how it should be because after all baseball is a team game there s an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball team and some people s conception of a biological organism in the biology context we would very likely read fitness for the score of the game and organisms for teams how we interpret players is trickier but either organs or genes might seem reasonable choices depending on what point we were trying to make a genes interpretation actually might be really interesting in this case but that would be a different and probably longer post if however we take the organ view then our knowledge of biology should make us pause before we start saying things like species x is more fit than species y because of a better organ z given what we know about the interdependence of organs we would often be suspicious of such claims but note that this type of argument is quite often made when you map species x onto humans and organ z onto brain on the other hand some statements of this kind do seem more reasonable than others as far as we can test them e g brain above might be more reasonable than pancreas assuming no gross pathology particularly if species y is a primate even when you make such statements you should be concerned with the functioning of the whole organism and the possibility that one organ might be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial in some third species however if we are non vitalists with any kind of reductionsit streak we will want to say that an organism is not some completely magical unanalyzable whole but an intriguing process made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are potentially observable some of these processes might be localized to particular organs while others may be distributed across multiple organs in a way this is just like a baseball team except that i think it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved in baseball are much simpler and less numerous than in most organisms to say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab solutely that player a s team would have played better with player b in their lineup sheer speculation impossible to ascertain one thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly controlled experiments are sometimes very tough to do but of course this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they can and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the absence of certainty most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation but even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research if you want to select a group of statistics and claim that clemens has done better than another pitcher with those statistics as a criteria then fine in this cases we re seeing the word statistics means summary of observed events where the events themselves can be viewed as the output of some process and possibly inputs for other processes thus if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together into the functioning organism data in the form of statistics might give us a basis to test particular hypotheses but you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the individual s contribution to winning the ws because that is the only measure of best that has any meaning in the context of baseball this statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again fitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment you might be fit in one situation and not another moving to baseball it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an environment including all the other teams in the league in at least a nominal sense the division winners are the fittest teams in the league in that they on average had better fitness scores than any of their competing opponennts but in a real sense there is a fairly large random component in the performance of each team that is difficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors intrinsic to or interesting for baseball the same is true in biology but here is also no direct biological equivalent of the world series in basebal in the world series the random component may be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played and both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement where they were originally successful it might be fun to watch but it s unclear what it all really means now just one more un related point i have yet to see that any of you can predict a ws winner with any greater accuracy than jeanne dixon on the other hand you have seen some of us who can predict the outcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of teams to finishes and maybe some of us e g me who can do this better than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis but this is probably only due to the fact that a game schedule gives you a little hope that bad hops aren t the only difference between the winners and the losers moreover you ve had the opportunity to see some analysis of the world series situation that makes the strong claim that nobody can predict the ws winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only to reflect the well known home vs road effect on winning percentage the stats are a nice hobby and that s about it there is no new knowledge being produced since stats are summaries of events it s true that if you know the events you can derive the stats but if somebody is trying to understand the process behind the stats then the stats produce new knowledge and some of this might even be reliable repeatable and useful speaking of which i should get back to producing knowledge in a different field that is of course if i can produce knowledge even though i m relying on stats to do it jking

triva question on bosio s no hitter i don t actually have the answer to this one bosio after walking the first two batters retired straight for a back end perfect game how many other games including extra inning games have seen a pitcher retire straight excluding official perfect games the only other instance of this i know about for sure is the famous ernie shore game which counts as a perfect one according to those goons in cooperstown shore came into the game when boston pitcher babe ruth got thrown out for arguing over the first batter walk shore picked him off and retired straight after that matt wall wall cc swarthmore edu hey i gotta job here ok april boston red sox seize first place

reference shown to be consistent in the past overall performance l r splits even matching hitting pitching styles all of these will give me some advantage if used properly was predicting the future the next ab he was predicting that sabo was more likely to get a hit than samuel he believed one of two things sabo was more likely than samuel to get a hit or that more good would be done in the long run by leaving sabo in regardless of the expectation of the actual outcome in fact you don t know what perez had in mind when he left sabo in by supporting the swap you are predicting the opposite in fact i don t think anyone is claiming that they can predict the future or any particular future event but we can believe that certain trends are due to a cause whether or not we have identified the cause and therefore will continue and i am not dismissing your work i m stating my opinion you are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary invalid so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult to your work well yes you are aware of its existance you claim to be incapable of understanding it though i suspect you are simply unwilling yet you rather forcefully state the opposite you don t seem to think the work is worth reading yet you obviously feel the topic is important i d say this is insulting i think seeing insults in other people s opinions is kind of silly after all mark didn t call you a total idiot or call your work stupid he simply stated that it didn t change his opinion on the subject i did not say that it is a consistent skill i have said that it is an indicator of performance under a certain set of circumstances right this is the beef it has not proven to be an indicator of future performance under any circumstances at least none that we ve been able to come up with if you know of some where it is an indicator of future performance please let us in on your secret if player a hits better on tuesdays and always has and mark believes that it might be an indication that he will hit on tuesday better next season as well would you respond the same way at some point you might admit that all variable might not be known to you who knows what this guy does every monday night maybe he sees his sports shrink on tuesday mornings or has his vitamin b shots monday nights but this is something that s true of one guy only it doesn t mean that there will be a meaningful correlation for the entire league by days of the week nor that there should be but it doesn t mean we can t make predictions based on that for that particular player i believe that by season s end that chris sabo s batting average in clutch situations will be significantly lower than his batting average in non clutch situations i can t prove that it will happen so i guess we ll just have to wait and see is this simply a prediction for chris sabo for this year or is this a prediction for all batters who have over the past few years hit xxx amount worse in the clutch than overall i only see a prediction for one player here i don t see anything about all batters here s another one for you in joe carter s batting average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting average in non clutch situations each year i presume you think this is random i m not going to get into case analysis sure you can find somebody who hit poorly from and then hit poorly in as well you can also find those who hit poorly from and then hit well in that s exactly what mark is trying to do though find hitters that have these correlation and ask whether we can make predictions for these hitters based on their past performance major league ballplayers it just makes me think that in joe carter s batting average in the clutch is not going to be as high as his ba in non clutch situations gambler s fallacy unless there is reason to expect consistency a huh what does gambler s fallacy have to do with anything whether you can know the reason for correlation or not you can t deny that it has existent you can only make an argument that you don t think it is likely to continue to exist because you can t see a reason for it to exist run proves nothing can you give us a reason to expect clutch ba to correlate from one year to the next i ve seen a detailed study of someone posted recently on why negative clutch would correlate the argument along the lines of star player with l r splits will always see an adverse condition in late innings of a close game i e opposing manager will always bring in a ah pitcher to face him where his manager will not pull him for a ph i don t see how you can deny it as for total idiot yes if you prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might suggest that you are wrong i would say the term fits nicely so tell me
