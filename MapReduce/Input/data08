re uninterruptible power supply alung megatest com aaron lung writes in article qk inn hp col col hp com cab col hp com chris best writes i m no expert at ups s but you said something that made it sound like you didn t realize something on a typical ups well on ours anyway there is no switchover from ac to dc all the protected equipment is always running from the batteries via an inverter with the usual condition of also having them on charge if the power fails big deal the computers never see it until the batteries start to droop but there s something like car sized batteries in that cabinet so it takes a while if you were gonna run the guts on straight dc instead of an inverter why not do it all the time then there d be no switchover to screw things up and no having to sense the failure fast just keep the dc on charge when the power is on and it ll be there in zero time when you need it actually it s a bit more complicated than that i sounds to me your ups takes in ac rectifies it to dc to charge the batteries and then takes the battery dc and chops it to ac again feeding your equipment this approach is the easiest and cleanest way to switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since as you mentioned nothing will know about what happened down the line another way to do the ups scheme is to use the mains until you lose power and then kick in the battery backup with it s inverter to replace the lost power the problem here is the switchover time and you ve got to resync the ac in no time flat that s a standby unit not a ups otherwise there would be no interuption many standby units are labled as ups s though morgan bullard mb coewl cen uiuc edu or mjbb uxa cso uiuc edu unfortunately most everything is built around the assumption that ac is available so the ups guys have to provide and ac output to be usable ya sorta have to make it work with what there already similar story with our telephone system it was first invented back in the s we re still using the same damn system media as they did back then if i have a phone from back then i can assure you it ll work on today s phone system it costs too much to overhaul everyone to a new system so they make it work with what is out there

re radio electronics free information card in article c ulqg i acsu buffalo edu v mb k ubvmsb cc buffalo edu neil b gandler writes how does the radio electronics free information cards work do they just send you some general information about the companies that advertise in their magazine or does it also give you sign you up for a catalog that depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled radio electronics compiles all of the cards then each advertiser gets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers who circled their number some magazines also provide the data on self adhesive labels and the really big magazines provide the data on computer disk the advertiser decides what to do with the data they get you will notice that the radio electronics information card commonly called a bingo card in the industry includes lines for a company name and a business phone number my guess would be that the big national advertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as best they can for example if you include motorola as your company and include a business phone and a mail stop tektronics will probably send you a copy of their hard bound catalog and have a sales engineer call you about a week later if you leave it blank odds are they will send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail outlet medium and small companies are more likely to send you th e whole catalog and then some companies like digikey or jameco have nothing to mail out accept the catalog a couple of other interesting points about bingo cards free industry magazines like edn and such also log your card to their computer they use the information at least three ways they note that you really do read the magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push you through repeated mailings to re subscribe they also compile how many people requested which data for their marketing demographics this way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that of readers requesting data were interested in capacitors and finally some magazines rent lists of readers who request certain information for example tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information about test equipment other than tektronic s in the past months the other point in the data the advertiser receives many magazines include how many items you circled on the card if they want the advertiser can attempt to cull out the literature collectors from the serious potential customers can you say qualified sales leads i thought you could what s the best way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards never circle more than number on the card if you want more than items use the second card and mail it a couple of weeks later if you are really really serious and you really really want the information call the advertiser and ask this will also cut about days off the the response time virtually everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data on a computer printout to help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you re not really qualified for send in a bingo card at least every other month and circle two or three numbers include a business name and phone number even if it s your house advertisers almost never call john schuch publisher of the arizona high tech times the arizona electrical journal the arizona hvac news all of which have bingo cards

re migraines and scans dn from nyeda cnsvax uwec edu david nye dn a neurology dn consultation is cheaper than a scan and also better because a neurologist can make a differential diagnosis between migraine tension type headache cluster benign intracranial hypertension chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and other headache syndromes that all appear normal on a scan a neurologist can also recommend a course of treatment that is appropriate to the diagnosis dn also since many people are convinced they have brain tumors or other dn serious pathology it may be cheaper to just get a ct scan then have dn them come into the er every few weeks dn and easier than taking the time to reassure the patient right dn personally i don t think this can ever be justified sigh it may never be justifiable but i sometimes do it even after i try to show thoroughness with a detailed history neurologic examination and discussion with the patient about my diagnosis salted with lots of reassurance patients still ask why can t you order a scan so we can be absolutely sure aunt millie often gets into the conversation as in they ignored aunt millie s headaches for years and then she died of a brain tumor aneurysm or whatever if you can get away without ever ordering imaging for a patient with an obviously benign headache syndrome i d like to hear what your magic is every once in a while i am able to bypass imaging by getting an eeg mind you i don t think eeg is terribly sensitive for brain tumor but the patient feels like something is being done as if the hours i spent talking with and examining the patient were nothing the eeg has no ionizing radiation it s much cheaper than ct or mri and the eeg brings in some money to my department slmr e mail jim zisfein factory com jim zisfein

re lung disorders and clubbing of fingers in article slagle mar sgi msd lmsc lockheed com slagle lmsc lockheed com writes can anyone out there enlighten me on the relationship between lung disorders and clubbing or swelling and widening of the fingertips what is the mechanism and why would a physician call for chest xrays to diagnose the cause of the clubbing purists often distinguish between true clubbing and pseudo clubbing the difference being that with true clubbing the angle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantly negative when proceeding distally towards the fingertip with pseudo clubbing the angle is initially positive then negative which is the normal situation real internists can talk for hours about clubbing i m limited to a couple of minutes whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is entirely unclear but it is one of those things that internists love to paw over during rounds supposedly only true clubbing is associated with disease the problem is that the list of diseases associated with clubbing is quite long and includes both congenital conditions and acquired disease since many of these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia it is very reasonable to get a chest xray however many of the congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac catheterization the cause of clubbing is unclear but presumably relates to some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to dilate abnormally clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is a tipoff to do more extensive examination often however the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent km

re menangitis question in article c nzn mzx crdnns crd ge com brooksby brigham nosubdomain nodomain glen w brooksby writes this past weekend a friend of mine lost his month old daughter in a matter of hours to a form of menangitis the person informing me called it nicereal meningicocis sp in retrospect the disease struck her probably sometime on friday evening and she passed away about pm on saturday the symptoms seemed to be a rash that started small and then began progressing rapidly she began turning blue eventually which was the tip off that this was serious but by that time it was too late this is all second hand info my question is is this an unusual form of menangitis how is it transmitted how does it work ie how does it kill so quickly no the neiseria meningococcus is one of the most common forms of meningitis it s the one that sometimes sweeps schools or boot camp it is contagious and kills by attacking the covering of the brain causing the blood vessels to thrombose and the brain to swell up it is very treatable if caught in time there isn t much time however the rash is the tip off infants are very susceptible to dying from bacterial meningitis any infant with a fever who becomes stiff or lethargic needs to be rushed to a hospital where a spinal tap will show if they have meningitis seizures can also occur immediate family members were told to take some kind of medication to prevent them from being carriers yet they didn t have any concerns about my wife and i coming to visit them it can live in the throat of carriers don t worry you won t get it from them especially if they took the medication gordon banks n jxp skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and geb cadre dsl pitt edu it is shameful to surrender it too soon

re sinus vs migraine was re sinus endoscopy i noticed several years ago that when i took analgesics fairly regularly motrin at the time i seemed to get a lot of migraines but had forgotten about that until i started reading some of the posts here i generally don t take nsaids or tylenol for headaches because i ve found them to be ineffective however i have two other pain sources that force me to take nsaids currently naprosyn first is some pelvic pain that i get at the beginning of my period and then much worse at midcycle i have had surgery for endometriosis in the past years ago so the drs tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back i ve tried synarel it reduced the pain while i took it mos but the pain returned immediately after i stopped three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only real solution to my problem although i don t expect to have any more children i don t like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed the first ovary was removed when i had the surgery for endometriosis one of the drs that suggested i get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children so basically all i m left with is toughing out the pain this would be impossible without naprosyn or something similar but not aspirin that doesn t work and motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago so i m through with it in fact naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if i take it regularly as i did when i had severe back pain and pain in both legs as i ll discuss in a moment generally though i wait until i have the pain before i take the naprosyn but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain it s actually quite effective at reducing the pain it just takes quite a while in the meantime i m frequently in severe pain the other pain source i have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy i ve had mris xrays ct scan and emgs i ve had of them and don t intend to ever do that again with nerve conduction tests the tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain the mri reports both say i have several bulging degeneratig disks and from the xrays and mri i think it is apparent that i have arthritis the reading on the ct scan was that there are two herniations l l and l l but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations the second emg and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first emg oh yeah i had some other horrible test called something like somatic evoked response which showed that the internal nerves are working fine anyway the bottom line is that i sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain the back pain is there all the time but i can live with it when the leg pain is there i need some analgesic anti inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where i can work so i took naprosyn regulary for months every time i tried to stop the leg pain got worse so i d always resume since last november i have taken it much less frequently and primarily for the pelvic pain i have been going to physical therapy for the last months times a week after the first month or so my therapist put me on pelvic traction she had tried it earlier but it had caused a lot of pain in my back this time she tried it at a lower weight after a month or two the pain in my legs began going away but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage so now i don t have nearly as much pain in my legs in fact my therapist took me off traction about weeks ago getting back to my original reason for this post even if i can avoid taking analgesic for headaches i really can t avoid them entirely because i have other pain sources that force me to use them oh i forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that i have back surgery but i m avoiding that too i find the migraines difficult to deal with occassionally i have to take off work but usually i can work but at a reduced capacity i m a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing when the pelvic pain is bad i can t concentrate much i usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes because the pain is so bothersome when the pain in my back is bad it can cause severe burning in both legs shooting pains in my legs electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes and basically when it gets bad i can t really sit at all then i end up spending most of my time home and in bed so even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources i get a lot of migraines an average of to a month which last days i ve taken cafergot the first time the caffiene really got to me so i reduced the dosage but i don t like the side effects if i take more than two i get diahrea if i get a very bad headache i will eventually take the cafergot my neurologist wasn t very helpful when i told him my problems with cafergot he said that when sumatriptan becomes available i should try that i ve tried several other medications fiornal midrin fiornal with codeine tegretol and inderal but they either didn t work or i couldn t tolerate them so what can i do my doctor s seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain which i agree with most of the time but not when i have a lot of pain i ve had some bad experiences with surgery my heart stopped once from the anesthesia i was told that it was likely the succinylcholine and i ve already had surgery several times anyway the point of what i m saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines some people need to take them to tolerate other pain janice rathmann

re jiggers i may not be the world s greatest expert on chiggers a type of mite indigenous to the south but i certainly have spent a lot of time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years since we moved to n c here are some observations gained from painful experience reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person some people get tiny red bites others like me are more sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore like affairs chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving i swear that these things will itch for months there is a lot of folklore about chiggers i think most of it is fiction i have tried to do research on the critters since they have such an effect on me the only book i could find on the subject was a single book in unc s special collections library i have not yet gone through what is required to get it based on my experience and that of my family members the old folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn t work i recall reading that the theory upon which it is based that the chiggers burrow into your skin and continue to party there is false i think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some sort the little pests release but this is speculation the best approach is prevention a couple of things work well a good insect repellent deet such as deep woods off liberally applied to ankles waistband etc is a good start there is another preparation called chig away that is a combination of sulfur and some kind of cream cortisone that originally was prepared for the army and is not commercially available in the summer i put this on my ankles every morning when i get up on weekends since i literally can t go outside where we live in the country without serious consequences they apparently don t like sulfur much at all you can use sulfur as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them no amount of prevention will be completely successful forget the fingernail polish i have finally settled upon a treatment that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone creme reduces the inflamation and swelling and benzocaine relieves the itch i won t tell you all the things i ve tried nor will i tell you some of the things my wife does since this counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned i also think it gains nothing the swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved by the application of hot packs and this seems to speed recovery as well doctors seem not to care much about chiggers the urban and suburban doctors apparently don t encounter them much and the rural doctors seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure i suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers would make a lot of money gary h merrill principal systems developer c compiler development sas institute inc sas campus dr cary nc sasghm theseus unx sas com mcnc sas sasghm

should patients read package inserts pdr in article mar news wesleyan edu rginzberg eagle wesleyan edu ruth ginzberg writes hmmmm here s one place where i really think the patient ought to take more responsibility for him or herself there is absolutely no reason why you can t ask the pharmacist filling the prescription for the physicians package insert for the medication when you pick it up at the pharmacy make sure to tell the pharmacist that you want the physicians package insert not the if people are going to do this i really wish they would tell me first i d be happy to go over the insert in the pdr with them and explain everything all too many patients read the insert and panic and then on the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug and we are starting over again at square one some of them probably didn t even come back for followup because they didn t want to admit they wouldn t take the drug or thought i was trying to kill them or something what people don t understand about the inserts is that they report every adverse side effect ever reported without substantiating that the drug was responsible the insert is a legal document to slough liability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to happen if patients want to have the most useful and reliable information on a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the ama drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific there are very few drugs that someone hasn t reported a death from taking patients don t realize that and don t usually appreciate the risks to themselves properly i m sure herman is going to go ballistic but so be it another problem is that probably most drugs have been reported to cause impotence half the males who read that will falsely assume it could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will refuse to take any drug like that this can be a real problem for pdr readers there needs to be some way of providing patients with tools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need i am involved in a research project to do that with migraine as the domain it involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions about migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient for common illnesses such as migraine and hypertension this may help quite a bit the patient could spend as much time as needed with the computer and this would then not burden the physician clearly physicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have as is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked things that the patients should have found out from their physician but didn t why they didn t isn t always the physician s fault either sometimes the patients are afraid to ask they won t be as afraid to ask the system we hope gordon banks n jxp skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and geb cadre dsl pitt edu it is shameful to surrender it too soon

natural anti cancer aids remedies the biggest reason why the cost of medical care is so extremely high and increasing is that natural methods of treatment and even diagnosis are still being systematically ignored and suppressed by the money grubbing and power mongering medical establishment some examples of very low cost natural anti cancer remedies are listed in the following article natural anti cancer remedies a rd opinion some of these remedies also work against aids disclaimer this list was compiled from unorthodox sources that have shown themselves to be reliable the compiler of this list is not a doctor of any kind but is exercising his first amendment constitutional right of free speech on the subjects of his choice most of these remedies can be found in any grocery store most of the rest of them can be found in any health food store what is important is how they are used and what else is excluded during their use the day fast st day eat as much fresh fruit as you want one kind at a time preferably grapes nd day eat all the vegetables you want at least half raw including garlic also whole kernel corn to help scrape clean the intestinal linings rd day drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice you want preferably start with to ounces of prune juice with pulp followed by a gallon of pure not from concentrate apple juice then grape juice stay close to your home bathroom th day eat all the un salted nuts no peanuts and dried fruit you want preferably raisins and almonds almonds contain laetrile th day one gallon of lemonade squeeze the juice from two lemons into a gallon of water preferably distilled and add to tablespoons of locally made honey no sugar drink one glass per hour everyone including healthy people should do this one day every week preceded by a large glass of prune juice with pulp th day same as th day th day same as th day all days eat only the foods listed above for each day along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements plus as much distilled water as you want the grape diet eat to ounces of fresh grapes every hours am to pm every day for six days eat nothing else during the six days but drink as much distilled water as you want apple cider vinegar mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar not apple cider flavored vinegar regular vinegar is harmful in a glass of water preferably distilled and drink all of it do this or times per day for weeks then stop for a week repeat if desired do this along with a normal healthy diet of natural foods this remedy is especially effective against those types of cancer that resemble a fungus as well as against other kinds of fungus infections the sea salt soda bath please keep an open mind fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in immerse yourself in it for a minute and then completely dissolve in the bath water pound of sun evaporated sea salt regular salt won t work and pound of fresh baking soda soak in this bath for to minutes while exercising your fingers toes and limbs turning sideways and onto your stomach dunking your head sitting up and laying back down chomping your teeth together etc among other things the sea salt soda bath neutralizes the accumulated effects of x rays etc as described in the book born to be magnetic vol by frances nixon precautions only the one person using each bath should prepare it and drain it for at least minutes after taking the bath stay away from and even out of sight of other people your greatly expanded aura energy field during that time could disrupt other people s fields two hours after the bath eat at least ounces of yogurt containing active yogurt cultures the bath may kill friendly bacteria also better yet take a billion bacteria acidophilus capsule which is also an excellent daily remedy against the effects of a i d s because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the digestive tract taking a big load off the remaining immune system because this external bath can kill in ternal bacteria it may also be a cure for lyme disease do not take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder storm within days of a full moon nor during major or minor periods as listed in the solunar tables published bimonthly in field stream magazine because of the measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy fields present at those times do not take this bath more than four times per year miscellaneous natural anti cancer remedies for skin cancer apply stabilized aloe vera jel to the affected skin twice daily and take to tablespoons per day of stabilized aloe vera juice internally for about months d m s o dimethyl sulfoxide causes cancer cells to perform normal cell functions almonds un blanched un roasted contain laetrile to help prevent cancer eat several almonds every day to help cure cancer eat several ounces of almonds per day never take large concentrated doses of laetrile orally it will kill you take it intravenously only cancer cells contain a certain enzyme which converts laetrile into cyanide which then kills the cell this enzyme is also present in the digestive system anti oxidants are free radical scavengers and include vitamin e selenium mcg per day is safe for most people chromium up to mcg per day vitamin a iu per day is safe for most people superoxide dismutase up to units per day vitamin c up to mg per day and bht butylated hydroxy toluene to capsules of bht every night at bedtime will also make one immune against herpes both types suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes prevent spreading herpes to other people but will not cure herpes bht might also do these things against a i d s which is really a form of cancer similar to leukemia see the book life extension by durk pearson and sandy shaw hydrogen peroxide dilute twelve drops of hydrogen peroxide in a glass of pure water preferably distilled and drink it do this once or twice per day hours before or after eating or drinking anything else apply hydrogen peroxide directly to skin cancers several times per day use hydrogen peroxide only if you are taking a good daily dose of some of the various anti oxidants described above vitamin mineral supplements are more effective and much less expensive when combined together in mega doses into single tablets made from natural sources cancer cells can not live in a strong maxwell north magnetic field especially if it is pulsating on and off a strong south magnetic field is an aphrodisiac in my opinion all types of ionizing radiation treatments for cancer should be replaced with daily minute doses of pulsating maxwell north magnetic fields properly made and operated radionics psionics machines can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer as well as most other medical problems some radionics psionics machines can even take cross sectional x ray like photos of cancer tumors etc with out x rays interferon tablets taheebo tea lapacho homeopathy can cure cancer and many other medical problems even drug addiction mg per day of chelated zinc can help prevent or cure prostate trouble this list is not exhaustive the above natural remedies can cure both diagnosed and un diagnosed cancers as well as prevent them and also prevent and cure many other medical problems including heart diseases they are not too simple and inexpensive to work effectively besides acting on a person biologically and chemically these remedies especially the day fast and the grape diet send a strong message to one s subconscious mind programming it to cure the cancer in my opinion if a person finds out that s he has cancer then s he should promptly try at least the first remedies described above in sequence starting with the day fast before resorting to the un natural and expensive mutilations and agonies poison burn and mutilate of orthodox cancer treatment organi ed crime disclaimer this list was compiled from unorthodox

post it along with the other faq stuff if you have questions you want to send mail to richard not me dan software tools to help with rsi this file describes tools primarily software to help prevent or manage rsi this version now includes information on such diverse tools as calendar programs and digital watches please let me know if you know any other tools or if you have information or opinions on these ones and i will update this faq i am especially interested in getting reviews of these products from people who have evaluated them or are using them richard donkin internet mail richardd hoskyns co uk tel direct fax changes in this version added information on stressfree another typing management tool for windows typing management tools these aim to help you manage your keyboard use by warning you to take a break every so often the better ones also include advice on exercises posture and workstation setup some use sound hardware to warn of a break others use beeps or screen messages often rsi appears only after many years of typing and the pain has a delayed action in the short term too frequently you can be typing all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening these tools act as an early warning system by listening to their warnings and taking breaks with exercises you don t have to wait for your body to give you a more serious and painful warning that is getting rsi tool at your service commercial software available from bright star tel platforms mac system windows description provides calendar keyboard watch email watch and system info warns when to take a break configurable has a few recommendations on posture and exercises sound oriented will probably work best with sound card pc or with microphone mac should be possible to

program warns you to take breaks after a configurable interval based on clock time or after a set number of keystrokes whichever is earlier it gives you exercises to do each time randomly selected from a set of exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work you do data entry word processing information processing exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on how to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does chb includes hypertext information on rsi that you can use to learn more about rsi and how to prevent it other information on non rsi topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer a full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included chb can be run in a dos box under windows but does not then warn you when to take a break it does not therefore appear useful when used with windows cost quantity discounts site licenses comments the keystroke counting approach looks good it seems better to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to measure clock time or even typing time the marketing stuff is very good and includes some summaries of research papers as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company to pay up for rsi management tools tool eyercise commercial software available from ran enterprises one woodland park dr haverhill ma us tel us only platforms windows os pm not dos description aimed at preventing rsi and eye strain this program warns you to take breaks after a configurable interval or at fixed times optionally displays descriptions and pictures of exercises pictures are animated and

exercises the stretches work all parts of your body relieving tension and helping to prevent repetitive strain injury the visual training exercises will improve your peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain together these help you to become more relaxed and productive the package includes the book computers visual stress by edward c godnig o d and john s hacunda which describes the ergonomic setup for a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to promote healthy and efficient computer use cost including shipping and handling quantity discounts for resellers free demo outside us comments i have a copy of this and it works as advertised i would say it is better for rsi prevention than rsi management because it does not allow breaks at periods less than minutes also it interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time which is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day worked ok on windows though it did occasionally crash with a uae not sure why also refused to work with the space bar on one pc and has one window without window controls very usable though and does not require any sound hardware tool lifeguard commercial software

i have had a play with this and it works ok its user interface design is much better in though still a bit unusual expensive tool around and it does the job it is also the only tool with a redistributable demo so if you do get the demo post it on your local bulletin boards ftp servers and bitnet servers does not include general info on rsi and ergonomics but it does have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises tool typewatch freeware version october available from email to richardd hoskyns co uk anonymous ftp soda berkeley edu pub typing injury typewatch shar platforms unix tested on sco sunos mach character and x window mode description this is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you to stop typing based on how long you have been continuously typing it does not provide exercises but it does check that you really do take a break and tells you when you can start typing again typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing today each time it warns you which is useful so you know how much you really type it also logs information to a file that you can analyse or simply print out the warning message appears on your screen in character mode in a pop up window for x windows or as a zephyr message for those with athena stuff tim freeman tsf cs cmu edu has put in a lot of bug fixes extra features and support for x zephyr and mach not formally supported but email richardd hoskyns co uk for sco sunos character mode or tsf cs cmu edu for mach x window mode zephyr if you have problems or want to give feedback tool various calendar batch queue programs available from various sources platforms various description any calendar reminder program that warns you of an upcoming appointment can be turned into an ad hoc rsi management tool or any batch queue submission program that lets you submit a program to run at a specific time to display a message to the screen using windows as an example create a calendar file and include this filename in your win ini s load line so you get it on every startup of windows suppose you want to have breaks every minutes starting from am press f special time to enter an appointment enter hit enter and type some text in saying what the break is for then press f to set an alarm on this entry and repeat for the next appointment by using windows recorder you can record the keystrokes that set up breaks throughout a day in a rec file put this file on your run line as above and you will then with a single keypress be able to set up your daily appointments with rsi exercises the above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs an example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job that runs at am and warns you to take a break this will depend a lot on your operating system while these approaches are not ideal they are a good way of forcing yourself to take a break if you can t get hold of a suitable rsi management tool if you are techie enough you might want to write a version of typewatch see above for your operating system using batch jobs or whatever fits best tool digital watches with count down timers available from various sources e g casio bp description many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable number of minutes they usually reset easily to that number either manually or automatically while these are a very basic tool they are very useful if you are writing reading driving or doing anything away from a computer which can still cause or aggravate rsi the great advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you are doing comments my own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to my writing a lot more and still reading as much as ever which actually aggravated the rsi in my right arm though the left arm improved getting a count down timer watch has been very useful on some occasions where i write a lot in a day i have tried an old fashioned hour glass type egg timer but these are not much good because they do not give an audible warning of the end of the time period keyboard remapping tools these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one handedly or with a different two handed layout one handed typing tools may help but be very careful about how you use them if you keep the same overall typing workload you are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing and may therefore make matters worse tool hsh public domain available from anonymous ftp soda berkeley edu pub typing injury hsh shar platforms unix don t know which ones description allows one handed typing and other general keyboard remappings only works through tty s so you can use it with a terminal or an xterm but not most x programs tool dvorak keyboard tools various available from anonymous ftp soda berkeley edu pub typing injury xdvorak c also built into windows x description the dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout that involves more balanced hand use it may help prevent rsi a bit but you can also use it if you have rsi since it will slow down your

re science and methodology was homeopathy tradition in article lsj gninnl c saltillo cs utexas edu turpin cs utexas edu russell turpin writes i wrote or to use a phrasing that i think is more accurate science is the investigation of phenomena that avoids methods and reasoning that are known to be erroneous from past foul ups in article c iu hbn bunyip cc uq oz au bd psych psy uq oz au writes i can agree with this if you are talking about the less fundamental aspects of scientific method in fact i don t see the alternative as i don t think that the fundamentals are capable of experimental investigation in saying this i am agreeing with the work of people like kuhn feyerabend and lakatos while methodology cannot be subject to the same kind of experimental investigation as that to which it is applied it can be critically appraised methodologies can be compared to each other sometimes by the conflicting results they produce this kind of critical appraisal and comparison together with the inappropriateness of existing methodologies for new fields of study is what drives the evolution of methodologies and how we think about them as usual you are missing the whole point russell because you are not willing to even consider questionning your basic article of faith which is that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highest purpose of science is to avoid making mistakes this is like saying that the most important aspect of business management is accurate bookkeeping if science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes it would be a poor thing indeed what was the methodology of darwin what was the methodology of einstein what was for that matter the methodology of jenner and pasteur in an earlier article russell turpin writes none of the foregoing should be read as meaning that we should open the door to practitioners of quackery and psuedo science modern advocates of homeopathy chiropracty and traditional chinese medicine receive little respect because for the most part they use methods and reasoning that the kind of research lee lady recommends has shown to be terribly faulty this does not imply that all their treatments are ineffective it does imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are incapable of discovering which treatments are effective and which are not first of all i think you are arguing against a straw man because i don t think that anyone here is arguing that quackery pseudo science homeopathy chiropracty and traditional chinese medicine should be accepted as science i in particular think the basic ideas of homeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky what some of us do believe however is that some of these things including some of the flaky ideas are deserving of serious scientific attention if in fact it were true as you have stated above that those who do not use the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is effective and what is not then science today would not exist for all of current science is based on the past work of scientists whose methodology by current standards was seriously flawed it is certainly true that as methodology improves we need to re examine those results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies it is also true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on those early methodologies needs to be re examined in a more rigorous fashion by those qualified to do so credibly but to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double blind studies is capable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no ideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly be worthy of serious investigation this truly marks one s attitude as doctrinaire cultist this attitude is not compatible with a belief in reason in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects lady uhunix uhcc hawaii edu lady uhunix bitnet

experience pain at all then you absolutely need to go see a doctor as soon as you possibly can the difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery and a long drawn out ordeal go see a doctor now your garden variety doctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury generally any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in these kinds of problems don t wait though go see a doctor the remainder of this information is paraphrased without permission from a wonderful report by new zealand s department of labour occupational safety and health service occupational overuse syndrome treatment and rehabilitation a practitioner s guide first a glossary or fancy names for how you shouldn t have your hands note you re likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors rsi repetitive strain injury a general term for many kinds of injuries oos occupational overuse syndrome synonym for rsi ctd cumulative trauma disorder another synonym for rsi wruld work related upper limb disorders yet another synonym for rsi cts carpal tunnel syndrome see below hyperextension marked bending at a joint pronation turning the palm down wrist extension bending the wrist up supination turning the palm up wrist flexion bending the wrist down pinch grip the grip used for a pencil ulnar deviation bending the wrist towards the little finger power grip the grip used for a hammer radial deviation bending the wrist toward the thumb abduction moving away from the body overspanning opening the fingers out wide now then problems come in two main types local conditions and diffuse conditions local problems are what you d expect specific muscles tendons tendon sheaths nerves etc being inflamed or otherwise hurt diffuse conditions often mistaken for local problems can involve muscle discomfort pain burning and or tingling with identifiable areas of tenderness in muscles although they re not necessarily the problem why does occupational overuse syndrome occur here s the theory normally your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which pass among the muscle fibers when you tense a muscle you restrict the blood flow by the time you re exerting of your full power you re completely restricting your blood flow without fresh blood your muscles use stored energy until they run out then they switch to anaerobic without oxygen metabolism which generates nasty by products like lactic acid which cause pain once one muscle hurts all its neighbors tense up perhaps to relieve the load this makes sense for your normal sort of injury but it only makes things worse with repetitive motion more tension means less blood flow and the cycle continues another by product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from your nerves they need blood too anyway when you re typing too much you re never really giving a change for the blood to get back where it belongs because your muscles never relax enough to let the blood through stress poor posture and poor ergonomics only make things worse specific injuries you may have heard of note most injuries come in two flavors acute and chronic acute injuries are severely painful and noticable chronic conditions have less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real tenosynovitis an inflamation of the tendon sheath chronic tenosynovitis occurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent not enough to cause acute inflamation but enough to exceed the tendon sheath s ability to lubricate the tendon as a result the tendon sheath thickens gets inflamed and you ve got your problem tendonitis an inflammation of a tendon repeated tensing of a tendon can cause inflamation eventually the fibers of the tendon start separating and can even break leaving behind debris which induces more friction more swelling and more pain sub acute tendonitis is more common which entails a dull ache over the wrist and forearm some tenderness and it gets worse with repetitive activity carpal tunnel syndrome the nerves that run through your wrist into your fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them symptoms include feeling pins and needles tingling numbness and even loss of sensation cts is often confused for a diffuse condition adverse mechanical tension also known as neural tension this is where the nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly compressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere amt can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other oos disorders it is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy others for just about every part of your body there s a fancy name for a way to injure it by now you should be getting an idea of how oos conditions occur and why just be careful many inexperienced doctors misdiagnose problems as carpal tunnel syndrome when in reality you may have a completely different problem always get a second opinion before somebody does something drastic to you like surgery typing posture ergonomics prevention treatment the most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce tension in the muscles and tendons this requires learning how to relax if you re under a load of stress this is doubly important tune out the world and breath deep and regular relaxing should become a guiding principle in your work every three minutes take a three second break every three minutes take a three second break really do it every three minutes it s also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings calm down and relax if you can t sleep you really need to focus on this rest sleep and relaxation are really a big deal there are all kinds of other treatments of course drugs can reduce inflamation and pain custom molded splints can forcefully prevent bad posture surgery can fix some problems exercise can help strengthen your muscles regular stretching can help prevent injury good posture and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension ice or hot cold contrast baths also reduce swelling only your doctor can say what s best for you posture here are some basic guidelines i so liked the way this was written in the new zealand book that i m lifting it almost verbatim from appendix dwallach let your shoulders relax let your elbows swing free keep your wrists straight pull your chin in to look down don t flop your head forward keep the hollow in the base of your spine try leaning back in the chair don t slouch or slump forward alter your posture from time to time every minutes get up and bend your spine backward set the seat height first your feet should be flat on the floor there should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees and your thighs should not slope too much now draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable to work at if you are short this may be impossible the beest remedy is to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a footrest now adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space between the backrest and the seat pan the backrest should support you in the hollow of your back so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this area if you operate a keyboard you will be able to spend more time leaning back so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest if available now i diverge a little from the text a good chair makes a big difference if you don t like your chair go find a better one you really want adjustments for height back angle back height and maybe even seat tilt most arm rests seem to get in the way although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm rests which you can also rotate out of the way you should find a good store and play with all these chairs pick one that s right for you in the san francisco bay area i highly recommend just chairs the name says it all keyboard drawers wrist pads and keyboard replacements there is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right for some people wrist pads seem to work wonders however with good posture you shouldn t be resting your wrists on anything you would prefer your keyboard to be right there if you drop your arms at your side and then lift your hands up at the elbow you want your keyboard under your hands when your elbows are at about degrees of course you want to avoid pronation wrist extension and ulnar deviation at all costs wrist pads may or may not help at this you should get somebody else to come and look at how you work how you sit how you type and how you relax it s often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or deviated hands some argue that the normal flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly designed a number of replacements are available on the market today check out the accompanying typing injury faq keyboards for much detail requests for more info

water supplies vulnerable to milwaukee type disease outbreak here is a press release from the natural resources defense council new data show about major u s water supplies vulnerable to milwaukee type disease outbreak to national desk environment writer contact erik olson or sarah silver both of the natural resources defense council washington april internal epa data released today by the natural resources defense council reveals that about large water systems serving cities from boston to san francisco do not filter to remove disease carrying organisms leaving those communities potentially vulnerable to a disease outbreak similar to the one affecting milwaukee the epa list is attached these internal epa documents reveal that the safety of water supplies in many american cities is threatened by inadequate pollution controls or filtration said erik olson a senior attorney with nrdc water contamination isn t just a problem in bangladesh it s also a problem in bozeman and boston as of june about large surface water systems on epa s list probably will be breaking the law the safe drinking water act requires all surface water systems to either filter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use from pollution olson continued some systems are moving towards eventually implementing filtration systems but are expected to miss the law s deadline olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already a reality in other cities a survey of u s surface water systems by water utility scientists found that percent of raw water samples contained the milwaukee organism cryptosporidium and percent contained a similar parasite called giardia adding to the level of concern a general accounting office study released today by house health and environment subcommittee chairman henry waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the nation s system for conducting and following through on sanitary surveys of water systems this new information raises a huge warning sign that millions of americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be assured that their water is safe to drink we must immediately put into place programs to protect water sources from contamination and where this is not assured filtration equipment must be installed to protect the public olson noted the time has come for many of the nation s water utilities to stop dragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from contamination consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs needed to assure their water is safe to drink nrdc is a national non

re science and methodology was homeopathy tradition gary merrill writes not every wild flight of fancy serves or can serve in the appropriate relation to a hypothesis it is somewhat interesting that when anyone is challanged to provide an example of this sort the only one they come up with is the one about kekule surely there must be others but apparently this is regarded as an extreme example of a non rational process in science whereby a successful hypothesis was proposed but how non rational is it indeed an extreme example it came out of nowhere the connection kekule saw between it and his problem is fortunate but not extraordinary i for example often receive conjure solutions hypotheses for solutions to my everyday problems at moments when i appear to myself to be occupied with activities quite removed algorithms for that new software feature come when i trample the meadow on my occasional runs alternative better ways to instruct and rear my sons arrive while i weed the garden i ll swear i am not thinking about any of it when ideas come these ideas are not the stuff of great discoveries of course but my connecting them to particular problems is fraught with deliberation and occasional fits of rationality surely it wasn t the only daydream kekule had what was special about this one could it have had something to do with a perceived analogy between the geometry of the snakes and problems concerning geometry of molecules yes and he was lucky to have such a colorful vivid image i alas will never figure out why returning worms to the loose soil of my garden brought have him count objects instead of merely count to mind regarding my year old s fledging arithmetic skills upon close examination is there a non rational mystical leap taking place or is it perhaps closer to a formal though often incomplete analogy or model the latter worms wiggling around in the dirt fascinate my son regards ted ted lehr my thoughts opinions and questions future systems technology group aws ibm internet lehr futserv austin ibm com austin tx
re science and methodology was homeopathy tradition avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable however it is also widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity and in ordinary life perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is indicative of a psychological disorder in the extreme case a perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might make that he is unable to even leave the house in science we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these discoveries usually there is some trade off between these two desiderata the search for scope and the search for certainty if th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from newton and leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today because neither of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense since they lacked the concept of a limit and in fact because of the lack of a rigorous foundation they made a number of errors in their use of calculus it was only a hundred years later that weistrass was able to give a solid grounding for the ideas of newton and leibniz nonetheless what newton and leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost through the mistakes they made in article apr kestrel edu king reasoning com dick king writes somebody writes i doubt if einstein used any formal methodology he also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would distinguish a universe in which special relativity holds from one in which it does not einstein played by the rules which demand that hypotheses only be put out there if there exists a specific experiment that could disprove them these are not the rules according to many who post to sci med and sci psychology according to these posters if it s not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then it s not science taken to the extreme i believe that the attitude that empirical studies are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification of science for one thing an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology results in a sort of scientific trade unionism where those outside the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have no chance to obtain a hearing i don t in the least believe that this is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology nonetheless it is one of the results and although institutional science has certainly produced many wonderful results i think it is a foolish arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment and using less than perfect empirical methodology will ever come with anything worthwhile furthermore the big bucks approach to science promotes what i think is one of the most significant errors in science choosing to investigate questions because they can be readily handled by the currently fashionable methodology or because one can readily get institutional or corporate sponsorship for them instead of directing attention to those questions which seem to have fundamental significance for instance certain questions cannot be easily investigated with statistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative one could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many areas of psychology in my opinion a perusal of many of the papers resulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions into a statistical framework gives the lie to russell turpin s assertion that current scientific methods avoid all known errors i think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental error in science ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the others and i think that scientific journals are full of all too many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are worthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects lady uhunix uhcc hawaii edu lady uhunix bitnet

re science and methodology was homeopathy tradition in article apr cs rochester edu fulk cs rochester edu mark fulk writes flights of fancy and other irrational approaches are common the crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies they aren t of any use unless they make you do some experiments i ve known a lot of scientists whose fantasies lead them on to creative work usually they won t admit out loud what the fantasy was prior to the consumption of a few beers simple example warren jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a dna electrophoresis gel of human alu fragments he got very excited hoping that he d seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic genes this fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out binding assays the result was a well conserved or so bp sequence but why do you characterize this as a flight of fancy or a fantasy while i am unfamiliar with the scientific context here it appears obvious that his speculation for lack of a better or more neutral word was at least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptance of current theory coupled with his observations it would appear that something quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observation into that theory or to tailor the theory to cover the observation this does not seem like an example of what most would normally call a flight of fancy or a fantasy it is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs irrational perhaps you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out for perfectly rational reasons or interesting new theories that were first advanced from logical grounds the main examples i can think of are from modern high energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole well i think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word also extra scientific etc nor am i prepared to give a general account of rationality in terms of examples there is some danger of beginning to quibble over what a surprising experiment is what counts as surprising etc the same may be said about logical grounds my point is that quite frequently perhaps even most frequently the roots of a new theory can be traced to previously existing theories or even to previously rejected hypotheses of some other theory or domain i would offer some rather well known examples such as toricelli s puy de dome experiment done for the sake of his sea of air hypothesis was this theory and the resulting experimental test surprising well given the prior explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly must be counted as so was the theory constructed and the experiment designed out of perfectly rational grounds well there was a pretty successful and well know theory of fluids the analogy to fluids by toricelli is explicit the novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid but this was quite a novelty at the time was the theory interesting yes was it new well one could argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new domain but i think this begs certain questions we can debate that if you like gary h merrill principal systems developer c compiler development sas institute inc sas campus dr cary nc sasghm theseus unx sas com mcnc sas sasghm

re what are the problems with nutrasweet aspartame nutrasweet is a synthetic sweetener a couple thousand times sweeter than sugar some people are concerned about the chemicals that the body produces when it degrades nutrasweet it is thought to form formaldehyde and known to for methanol in the degredation pathway that the body uses to eliminate substances the real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyde produced are high enough to cause significant damage as both are toxic to living cells all i can say is that i will not consume it phenylalanine is nothing for you to worry about it is an amino acid and everyone uses small quantities of it for protein synthesis in the body some people have a disease known as phenylketoneurea and they are missing the enzyme necessary to degrade this compound and eliminate it from the body for them it will accumulate in the body and in high levels this is toxic to growing nerve cells therefore it is only a major problem in young children until around age or so or women who are pregnant and have this disorder it used to be a leading cause of brain damage in infants but now it can be easily detected at birth and then one must simply avoid comsumption of phenylalanine as a child or when pregnant heather

of the transplant recipients international organization trio unfortunately i was unable to post it before the date of this month s meeting i m posting it anyway and posting it world wide instead of regional in the hopes that some of the information may be useful or illustrative also i hope it can be used as an example and inspiration for the posting of other newsletters and data related to organ transplantation and donation mike transplant recipients international organization long island chapter p o box huntington ny newsletter april volume iv no next meeting the next meeting is wednesday april at pm at the knights of columbus emerald manor uniondale avenue in uniondale our guest speaker will be dr lewis teperman dr teperman trained in pittsburgh under dr starzl and is now the assistant director of the liver transplant program at new york university medical center dr teperman will discuss current trends in transplantation and treatment and will answer questions he is a long time friend of trio surgeon to many of our members and always a gracious and delightful guest it is sure to be a very informative interesting and engaging evening our hospitality committee bette and vito suglia and jim spence will be well prepared and at last the weather should be cooperative we hope to see a very large gathering to welcome dr teperman wednesday april k of c uniondale last meeting it has been noted here before that the long island chapter of trio has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather being able to forecast rain sleet and snow fully a month in advance no tv weatherman can match us this time we not only scored again but we were also able to disable the long island railroad making travel really difficult none the less many braved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good conversation our scheduled speaker mrs elizabeth linnehan a professional nutritionist had a family emergency and was not able to attend she hope she will be with us in the fall to discuss diet and medications however ms jennifer friedman an image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient was kind enough to step in on very short notice ms friedman gave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup even a bit for men to help us look well and healthy and to minimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine and drugs we take we are most grateful to jennifer and thank her for an entertaining evening annual meeting in addition to welcoming dr teperman the april meeting is also the annual meeting of the chapter this is the official notice of the meeting as required by our by laws the main purpose of the meeting is to review the past year solicit member views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs and to elect members of the board of directors for the coming two year term the nominating committee has prepared the following slate for the board anne liver recipient and don treffeisen robert heart recipient and eulene smith vito kidney recipient and bette suglia kay grenzig liver recipient jan schichtel kidney recipient larry juliano kidney recipient david bekofsky director public education litp those remaining on the board for another year are robert carroll liver kidney pancreas recipient jerry kidney recipient and jeanne eichhorn ron kidney donor and marie healy peter smith bone marrow recipient patricia ann yankus kidney and pancreas recipient walter ruzak kidney recipient this may seem to be a big board but many hands make light work and with our various medical uncertainties it is good to have backups for all the jobs on the board therefore in addition to the slate being presented for voting nominations will also be accepted from the floor there is no set number of board members and there is plenty of work in addition brief treasurer s and membership reports will be given and the floor will be open for any new business suggestions or comments anyone would like to bring up we will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the majority of the time with dr teperman future meetings remember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year may dr peter shaprio chief of psychiatry columbia presbyterian medical center june dr felix rappaport director of the stony brook kidney transplant program plan on being with us the second wednesday of each month notdaw the week of april is national organ and tissue donor awareness week notdaw while we are planning news releases speaking engagements and meetings with supervisors gullata and gaffney we have decided not to have our softball game because of two year s experience with miserable weather we all can help spread the word on donor awareness however we have found it effective to ask your pastor or rabbi to publish a letter or announcement in the parish bulletin allow you to address the congregation or include mention of the gift of life in his sermon attached to this newsletter is a sample letter and fact sheet you can use

re science and methodology was homeopathy tradition in article lsu q innia saltillo cs utexas edu turpin cs utexas edu russell turpin writes i agree with everything that lee lady wrote in her previous post in this thread gee maybe i ve misjudged you russell anyone who agrees with something i say can t be all bad seriously i m not sure whether i misjudged you or not in one respect i still have a major problem though with your insistence that science is mainly about avoiding mistakes and i still disagree with your contention that nobody who doesn t use methods deemed scientific can possibly know what s true and what s not deleted material which i agree with back to lee lady these are not the rules according to many who post to sci med and sci psychology according to these posters if it s not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then it s not science these posters are making the mistake that i have previously criticized of adhering to a methodological recipe a carefully rules such as support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and controlled study are too narrow to apply to all investigation i think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be convincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have occurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things to reuse the previous example we know that conclusions from uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical problems are notoriously problematic okay so let s see if we agree on this first of all there are degrees of certainty it might be appropriate for instance to demand carefully controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth to the extent that there is any such thing the effectiveness of a certain treatment on the other hand highly favorable clinical experience even if uncontrolled can be adequate to justify a preliminary judgement that a treatment is useful this is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support in this case it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing secondly it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal i come to this dispute about what science is not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci psychology and occasionally in sci med about nlp neurolinguistic programming much of the work done to date by nlpers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research for years now i have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes courtesy of your local university library not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement but simply to look at the nlp methodology especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest and most especially to be aware of the questions nlp suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation over and over again the response i get in sci pychology is if this hasn t been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can t be of any interest to us to me the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme there ve got to be controlled studies position is an nlp technique called the fast phobia trauma cure simple phobias as opposed to agoraphobia may not be the world s most important psychological disorder but the nice thing about them is that it doesn t take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell when someone is cured of one the nlp phobia cure is a simple visualization which requires less than minutes nlpers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory and hence is useful in treating post traumatic stress syndrome it is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists a subject only needs to be taken through the technique once or in the case of ptsd once for each traumatic incident the process doesn t need to be repeated and the subject doesn t need to practice it over again at home now to me it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure especially if as nlpers claim the success rate is extremely high take someone with a fear of heights as i used to have take them up to a balcony on the th floor and observe their response spend minutes to have them do the simple visualization send them back up to the balcony and see if things have changed check back with them in a few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting more long term follow up is certainly desirable but from a scientific point of view even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance in any case there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years to the best of my knowledge there is no known case where the cure has been reversed after holding for a few weeks my own cure incidentally was done with a slightly different nlp technique before i learned of the fast phobia trauma cure ten years later now i enjoy living on the th floor of my building and having a large balcony the folks over in sci psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test they claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory a study of the sort that nlp practitioners many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice can ill afford to do most of them are also just plain not interested because the whole idea seems frivolous and since they re not part of the scientific establishment they have no tangible rewards to gain from scientific acceptance the fast phobia trauma cure is over ten years old now and the clinical psychology establishment is still saying we don t have any way of knowing that it s effective these academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate as anyone could want of course but they say why should i prove your theory and the burden of proof is on the one making the claim one academic in sci psychology said that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn t been described in a scientific journal it s described in a number of books and i ve posted articles in sci psychology describing it in as much detail as i m capable of actually at least one fairly careful academic study has been done with favorable results but it s apparently not acceptable because it s a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal to me this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it this is the kind of thing i have in mind when i talk about doctrinnaire attitudes about science now maybe i have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you russell if so i

re barbecued foods and health risk this reminds me of the last graham kerr cooking show i saw today he smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot he used a strange technique i d never seen before he took a big pot with lid and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil the tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee table ash tray made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges in the tray he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar a similar quantity of brown rice he said any rice will do the contents of two teabags of earl grey tea and a few cloves on top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket type steamer with two chicken breasts in it the lid was put on and the whole assembly went on the stovetop at high heat for or minutes later he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts what surprises and concerns me are no wood chips where does the smoke flavor come from about or years ago i remember hearing that carmel color obtained by caramelizing sugar a common coloring and flavoring agent had been found to be carcinogenic i believe they injected it under the skin of rats or something if the results were conclusive caramel color would not be legal in the u s yet it is still being used was the initial research result found to be incorrect or what about or years ago i remember earl grey tea being implicated as carcinogenic because it contains oil of bergamot an extract from the skin of a type of citrus fruit does anyone know whatever happened with that story if it were carcinogenic earl grey tea could not have it as an additive yet it apparently continues to do so wrt natural wood smoke i ve smoking a duck right now as it happens i ve noticed that a heavily smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently stopped flowing i find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips my theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low molecular weight stuff like terpenes and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar the long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drives off the low molecular weight stuff just leaving the flavor behind does anyone know if my theory is correct i also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic for that reason and because it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess i only grill non drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals i do stuff like this duck by indirect heat i have a long rectangular weber and i put the coals at one end and the meat at the other end the fat drops directly on the floor below the meat and next time i use the barbeque i make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals and yet another reason i ve heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that smoked cured meat like pork sausage and bacon contains nitrosamines which are carcinogenic i m pretty sure this claim actually has some standing don t know about the others an amusing incident i recall was the duncan hines scandal when it was discovered that the people who make duncan hines cake mix were putting a lot of ethylene dibromide edb into the cake mix to suppress weevils this is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic the guy who represented the company in the press conference defended himself by saying that the risk from eating duncan hines products every day for a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal broiled steaks what a great analogy when i first heard that my immediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit one charcoal broiled steak would be equivalent to duncans

re what are the problems with nutrasweet aspartame hbloom moose uvm edu heather writes nutrasweet is a synthetic sweetener a couple thousand times sweeter than sugar some people are concerned about the chemicals that the body produces when it degrades nutrasweet it is thought to form formaldehyde and known to for methanol in the degredation pathway that the body uses to eliminate substances the real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyde produced are high enough to cause significant damage as both are toxic to living cells all i can say is that i will not consume it phenylalanine is nothing for you to worry about it is an amino acid and everyone uses small quantities of it for protein synthesis in the body some people have a disease known as phenylketoneurea and they are missing the enzyme necessary to degrade this compound and eliminate it from the body for them it will accumulate in the body and in high levels this is toxic to growing nerve cells therefore it is only a major problem in young children until around age or so or women who are pregnant and have this disorder it used to be a leading cause of brain damage in infants but now it can be easily detected at birth and then one must simply avoid comsumption of phenylalanine as a child or when pregnant heather if i remember rightly pku syndrome in infants is about they lack two genes and people who lack one gene are supposed to be persons those with pku have to avoid naturally occuring phenylalanine and those who only have one gene and underproduce whatever it is they are supposed to be producing are supposed to be less tolerant of aspartame the methol formaldahyde thing was supposed to occur with heating i don t drink it i figure sugar was made for a reason to quickly and easily satiate hungry people if you don t need the calories it s just as easy to drink water used to drink a six pack a aday of aspartame soda don t even drink one coke a day when sugared
re nih offers exploratory grants for alternative medicine in article apr island com green island com robert greenstein writes in article pitt uucp geb cs pitt edu gordon banks writes one problem is very few scientists are interested in alternative medicine so gordon why do you think this is so probably because most of them come packaged with some absurd theory behind them e g homoeopathy like cures like the more you dilute things the more powerful they get even if you dilute them so much there is no ingredient but water left chiropractic all illness stems from compressions of nerves by misaligned vertebrae such systems are so patently absurd that any good they do is accidental and not related to the theory the only exception is probably herbalism because scientists recognize the potent drugs that derive from plants and are always interested in seeing if they can find new plants that have active and useful substances but that isn t what is meant by alternative medicine usually if you get into the qi accupuntunce charts etc you are now back to silly theories that probably have nothing to do with why accupuncture works in some cases perhaps another reason they are reluctant is the rhine experience rhine was a scientist who wanted to investigate the paranormal and his lab was filled with so much chacanery and fakery that people don t want to be associated with that sort of thing gordon banks n jxp skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and geb cadre dsl pitt edu it is shameful to surrender it too soon

re eugenics subject re eugenics gordon banks writes probably within years a new type of eugenics will be possible maybe even sooner we are now mapping the human genome we will then start to work on manipulation of that genome using genetic engineering we will be able to insert whatever genes we want no breeding no hybrids etc the ethical question is should we two past problems with eugenics have been reducing the gene pool and defining the status of the eugenized inserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted genes later became transmissible to progeny then they may be able to crowd out garbage genes this may in the future become possible even if it does awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully mean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy later evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial africa and for diabetes in the hopi promoted survival in some conditions we don t really know what the future may hold for our environment the reduced wilderness and disease survival capacity of our relatively inbred domesticated animals comes to mind vulcanism nuclear winter ice age meteor impact new microbiological threats famine global warming etc etc are all conceivable therefore having as many genes as possible available is a good strategy for species survival of course the status of genetically altered individuals would start out as no different than anyone else s but if we could make philosopher kings with great bodies and long lives would we or they want to give them elevated status we could the romans did it with their kings without the benefits of such eugenics the race eventually realized and dealt with the problems which that caused but for a while it was a problem orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen to persons genetically altered for more menial tasks but there is nothing new under the sun we treated slaves the same way for millennia before i see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these problems humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to use any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time that hasn t stopped the race as a whole yet many are the civilizations which have died from inability to adapt to environmental change however also many are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own power the ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the fates of others and have survived by making better choices when their turns came not that i don t think that this gene altering power couldn t wipe us off the face of the earth or cause endless suffering nuclear power or global warming or whatever could and may still do that too the real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue i personally don t think man has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any better than he did the for last few we as eugenists may make it an we may not if we don t i hope there are reservoirs of garbage people out in some backwater with otherwise long discarded garbage genes which will pull us through i believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same man needs to accept input from the great spirit of god to overcome his lacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has some men have and i believe all men may listen to and obey the still small voice of god in their hearts this is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue needed to escape the problems consequent to poor choices peoples have died out for many reasons the societies which failed to accept enough input from god to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed themselves and often others in the process it is self evident that the ones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the spirit to use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes thus far or else haven t had enough power for long enough in summary i would say that the question of whether to use this new technology is really an ancient one and the answer in some ways hard in some ways easy is the same ancient answer it isn t the power it is the spirit sorry for the long post got carried away bob ruegg med unc edu
re science and methodology was homeopathy tradition in article ls lnvinnrtb saltillo cs utexas edu turpin cs utexas edu russell turpin writes not imply that all their treatments are ineffective it does imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are incapable of discovering which treatments are effective and which are not to start with no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible so there s a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a given context insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely and makes progress impossible expenditure of sufficiently large sums of money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this on the other hand with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which eventually turn out to be false there is a morass of studies contradicting other studies and outsiders start saying you people call this science my opinion for what it s worth is that one sees both these phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor appropriate for a particular investigation i don t believe it is ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science my second point though is that highly capable people can often make extremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using methodology considered inadequate by the usual standards i think this is true of many scientists and i think it is true of many who approach their discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific within mathematics i think there are several examples especially before the twentieth century one conspicuous case is that of riemann who is famous for many theorems he stated but did not prove later mathematicians did prove them of course i think that for a good scientist empirical investigation is often not so much a matter of determining what is true and what s not as it is a matter of convincing other people people have proposed lots of incompatible definitions of science here but i think the ability to objectively convince others of the validity of one s results is an essential element not that one can necessarily do that at every step of the scientific process but i think that if one is not moving toward that goal then one is not doing science when a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and seems to be very successful at it i think that his judgements are also worthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further investigation in article c by hd news hawaii edu i wrote namely is there really justification for the belief that science is a superior path to truth than non scientific approaches admittedly my question was not at all well posed a considerable amount of effort in a serious scholarly investigation such as i suggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately specific question to try and answer the science i was thinking of in my question is the actual science currently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century i certainly wasn t thinking of some idealized science or the mere use of reason and observation one thing i had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether in many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced practitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies since russell turpin seems to be much more familiar than i am with the study of scientific methodology perhaps he can tell us if there is any existing research related to this question in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects lady uhunix uhcc hawaii edu lady uhunix bitnet

critique of pressure point massager as promised below is a personal critique of a pressure point massager i recently bought from the self care catalog i am very pleased with the results the catalog description is as follows the pressure point massager is an aggressive physical massager that actually kneads the tension out of muscles much like a professional shiatsu masseur the powerful motor drives two counter rotating thumbs that move in one inch orbits releasing tension in the neck back legs and arms pressure point massager a to order or receive a catalog call hours days or fax at note when i ordered the massager the item number was different and the price was not when i received it i glanced thru the newer catalog enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one i was quite annoyed to see a difference in price i called them about it and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers although it looks and works exactly the same he told me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one using the price difference as a reason for return in fact since the newer ones might take a while to ship from the factory i received this one in days he told me i could use the one i already have until the new one arrives then return the old one very reasonable people i have long term neck shoulder and back pain if i were a building i would be described as structurally unsound i have stretches and exercises to do that help but the problem never really goes away if for whatever reason i do not exercise for a while illness not enough time lazy etc the muscles become quite stiff and painful and thus more prone to further strain even with exercise i sometimes require physical therapy to get back on track which st requires a doctor visit to get the prescription for p t the tension in my neck if not released eventually causes a headache sometimes confused with a sinus headache over my left eye when my physical therapist has massaged my neck and the sub occipital muscles in particular the knobby areas near the base of the skull the headache usually eased within a day although it hurts like hell to while it is being massaged i ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what i was wishing someone would invent a machine that would massage not vibrate my neck and sub occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in the past that i could use by myself no doctor visit or inconvenient p t appts for a week later would be needed to use it i could get up in the middle of the night and use it if necessary i have been using it for about a week or so now and love it the base unit is about a x rectangle about high with handles on each side and it plugs into an average outlet the two metal thumbs are about in diameter and protrude about above the base the thumbs are covered with a gray cloth that is non removable they are located more toward one end rather than centered see figure below they move in either clockwise or counter clockwise directions depending on which side of the switch is pushed and are very quiet it can be used from either side for instance the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck depending on which direction you approach it for the neck head the user varies the amount of pressure used by if laying down allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and or neck to rest on the thumbs the handles can also be used if sitting or standing applying pressure with the arms wrists since my wrists are also impaired i m typing this over an extended period of time and i don t have someone living with me who can apply it laying down works well for me for my back i sit in a high backed kitchen chair position the massager behind me at whatever point i want massaged and lean back lightly or not so lightly against it the pressure of leaning back holds it in place if i want to massage the entire spine i simply move it down a few inches whenever i feel like it for my back this machine is far superior to use than the commonly used home made massager of tennis balls taped together with the balls position against a wall or door them over the spine and move the body up and down against them the tennis balls are better than nothing but difficult to use for very long especially if your quads are not in good shape and my long hair gets painfully in the way if i don t pin it up first as far as i m concerned the easier something like this is to use the more likely i ll use do it if there are multiple considerations hassles i m more likely to not bother with it not only has this machine helped with my headaches but my range of motion for my neck and back are greatly increased the first time i used it on my neck sub occipital muscles however i overdid it and pressed too hard against it which resulted in a very tender almost bruised area for a few days i laid off it for about days and applied ice which helped after that i was more gradual about applying pressure at this point the pain in the sub occipital area is now minimal while being massaged i also learned to use very light pressure on my lower back which is the most vulnerable point for me it also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades although again it took a few days of massaging just a few minutes at a time to really work it out i highly recommend this product if you have similar problems although i cannot vouch for its durability it seems pretty sturdy since i ve had it such a short time i plan to use it not only to ease tension but also to loosen the muscls before exercising and maybe after too i have been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks so this was very timely for me this is the st product i ve ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru a co worker the catalog states they have been in business since it contains quite a few health care products and while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog products they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do definitely a step above some other ones i ve seen such as dr leonards health care catalog or mature wisdom i m only but have ended up on some geriatric type mailing lists no big surprise here i consider many of those products to be rip offs particularly targeted toward the elderly with dubious health benefits i apologize for the length of this but it s the kind of info i would like to know before ordering something thru the mail robin

immunotherapy for recurrent miscarriage following a series of miscarriages my wife was given a transfusion of my white cells the theory as i understand it is that there is some kind of immune blocking that prevents the body from attacking the pregnancy as it normally would a foreign body where this blocking is deficient the body evicts the intruder resulting in a miscarriage the white cells apparently enhance the blocking capability following the transfusion she successfully carried the next pregnancy to term and jake is now an active month old who cannot wait to walk we re now thinking about having another child but no one including the obgyn who supervised the first transfusion really seems to know whether or not the transfusion process needs to be repeated for successive pregnancies is there anyone in net land who has experience with this thanks gene and jane and jake p s i ve also posted this in misc kids

re the andromeda strain in article c pvp l chinet chi il us dhartung chinet chi il us dan hartung writes just had the opportunity to watch this flick on a e some years since i saw it last wow the wwii channel did something not wwii i was very interested in the technology demonstrated in this film for handling infectious diseases and similar toxic substances clearly they faked a lot of the computer robotic technology certainly at the time it was made most of that was science fiction itself let alone the idea of a space germ the graphics capabilities of the computers were very faked for movie audiences who have not ability or patience with numbers the book was more realistic in that respect in all respects actually the robotics are still out of range but not impossible quite coincidentally actually this is what got me wanted to see the movie again i watched a segment on the otherwise awful how d they do that dealing with a disease researcher at the cdc s top lab there was description of the elaborate security measures taken so that building will never be cracked so to speak by man or nature short of deliberate bombing from the air perhaps and the researchers used spacesuits similar to that in the film sf and i ve always wondered how crichton escapes this classification is usually ahead of science in both prediction and precaution nasa s decontaimination processes were supposedly taken to prevent sf story disasters i mean nasa scientists were often sf readers and sometimes writers and felt pre warned by their reading i m curious what people think about this film short of silly is such a facility technically feasible today i think the film still holds up among the best of sf films but that isn t saying a whole lot as far as the plot and the crystalline structure that is not life as we know it that s a whole nother argument for rec arts sf tech or something yep

hernia a bit more than a year ago a hernia in my right groin was discovered it had produced a dull pain in that area the hernia was repaired using the least intrusive orthoscopic method and a plug and patch the doctor considered the procedure a success a few months later the same pain returned the doctor said that he could find nothing wrong in the area of the hernia repair now the pain occurs more often my gp couldn t identify any specific problem the surgen who performed the original procedure now says that yes there is a new hernia in the same area and he said that he has to cut into the area for the repair this time my question to the net is there a nonintrusive method to determine if in fact there is a hernia or if the pain is from something else steve heffner

re science and methodology was homeopathy tradition i think that part of the problem is that i have proposed a definition of science that i intended to be interpreted broadly and that lee lady has interpreted fairly narrowly my definition is this science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids mistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous work lee lady writes i don t think that science should be defined in a way that some of the activities that lead to really important science namely thinking and informal exploration are not recognized as scientific work unless one classifies thinking and informal exploration as a mistake they fall under my definition i hope no one would consider speculation thinking and informal exploration as unscientific in article c nasf mh news hawaii edu lady uhunix uhcc hawaii edu lee lady writes seriously i m not sure whether i misjudged you or not in one respect i still have a major problem though with your insistence that science is mainly about avoiding mistakes here is where i think we are talking at cross purposes it is not clear to me that the kind of definition i have proposed should be taken as describing what science is mainly about consider for example a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking a backbone this fairly tells what is an invertebrate and what is not an invertebrate but it hardly tells you what invertebrates are all about one can read this definition and still not know that of all animal species are invertebrates that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form that some invertebrate groups such as insects and nematodes are ubiquitous in all ecosystems etc in short knowing the definition of invertebrates does not tell one what they are mainly about the misunderstanding here is my fault i did not give sufficient context for people to understand my proposed definition okay so let s see if we agree on this first of all there are degrees of certainty it might be appropriate for instance to demand carefully controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth to the extent that there is any such thing the effectiveness of a certain treatment on the other hand highly favorable clinical experience even if uncontrolled can be adequate to justify a preliminary judgement that a treatment is useful secondly it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal i agree on both counts as an example of the second it would only take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians that a treatment was effective despite a lack of controls as to the first i do not think it is useful to talk about absolute scientific truth i think it is more useful to talk about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the kinds of evidence in particular fields that in the past have proven faulty or reliable the latter is obviously a matter of degree and in each field practitioners try to discover the relevance of different kinds of evidence one of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as psuedo science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it and the historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence are given more weight than others it is perfectly alright to speculate i have read quite a few refereed papers that speculated left and right but the authors were careful to identify the notions as speculative to list what little evidence was presently available for them and to describe how research could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to uncover its problems often what distinguishes whether a paper of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the author sets the context and paves the way for future work it is in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail the folks over in sci psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test they claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory a study of the sort that nlp practitioners many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice can ill afford to do most of them are also just plain not interested because the whole idea seems frivolous and since they re not part of the scientific establishment they have no tangible rewards to gain from scientific acceptance i think a lot of scientists steer away from things that deserving or not garner a patina of kookiness when proponents of some practice see no value in more careful investigation of that practice that sets alarms ringing in many researchers minds this is unfortunate because there is undoubtedly some intersection between things that are worth investigating and things that are advocated by those who seem careless or unreasonable in their advocacy on the other hand i can understand why many scientists would just as soon select other directions for research as gordon banks has pointed out no one wants to become this generation s rhine one academic in sci psychology said that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn t been described in a scientific journal i think this is absurd actually at least one fairly careful academic study has been done with favorable results but it s apparently not acceptable because it s a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal i wonder why the results were not published in my field dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are submitted to journals often the papers are accepted for publication before the dissertation is finished this certainly eases one s defense finally i hope lee lady will forgive me from commenting either on nlp or the discussion of it in sci psychology i know little about either and so have nothing to offer russell

re is msg sensitivity superstition in article apr spdcc com dyer spdcc com steve dyer writes in article apr cunews carleton ca wcsbeau alfred carleton ca opirg writes there has been no hard info provided about msg making people ill that s the point after all why don t you just look it up in the merk or check out the medical dictionary cite which a doctor mentioned earlier in this thread that s because these peer reviewed studies are not addressing the effects of msg in people they re looking at animal models you can t walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects demonstrated in humans note that i wouldn t have any argument with a statement like noting that animal administration has pro duced the following blah blah we must be careful about its use in humans this is precisely not what you said among others see olney s excitotoxic food aditives relevance of animal studies to human safety neurobehav toxicol teratol vol i m sure peta would love to hear your arguments tests have been done on rhesus monkeys as well i have never seen a study where the mode of administration was intra ventricular the glu and asp were administered orally some studies used iv and sc intra ventricular is not a normal admin method for food tox studies for obvious reasons you must not have read the peer reviewed works that i referred to or you would never have come up with this brain injection bunk it most certainly is for neurotoxicology you know studies of glutamate involve more than food science whose talking about food science what is this comment supposed to mean neurotoxicology and tratology brain research nature progress in brain research all fine food science journals pardon me but where are you getting this from have you read the journals have you done a thorough literature search so point us to the studies in humans please i m familiar with the literature and i ve never seen any which relate at all to olney s work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons then you would know that olney himself has casually referred to chinese restaurant syndrome in a few articles why don t you point us to some studies maybe then this exchange could be productive the point is exceeding the window of course they re amino acids note that people with pku cannot tolerate any phenylalanine well actually they have to tolerate some phenylalanine it s a essential amino acid they just try to get as little as is healthy without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites in the blood they re unable to metabolise it olney s research compared infant human diets specifically the amount of freely available glu in mother s milk versus commercial baby foods vs typical lunch items from the standard american diet such as packaged soup mixes he found that one could exceed the projected safety margin for infant humans by at least four fold in a single meal of processed foods mother s milk was well below the effective dose goodness i m not saying that it s good to feed infants a lot of glutamate supplemented foods it s just that this projected safety margin is a construct derived from animal models and given that you can prove anything you like we re talking prudent policy in infant nutrition here yet you re misrepresenting it as received wisdom who said anything about received wisdom there is no question that orally administered doses of msg are capable of destroying nearly all neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median eminence these areas are responsible for the production of hormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal development of the vertabrate organism humans are vertebrates now what pray tell do you think will happen when the area of the brain necessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing are you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary anh and me of that part of the brain that is responsible for controlling the realease albeit indirectly of estradiol and testosterone how do you expect anyone to do the studies on this it s unethical to sacrifice humans to check out what effects chronic acute etc doses of these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans the food industry knows this that s why the animal model is used in medicine and psych if you re talking about straight sensitivity it would be useful to define the term there are plenty of studies on psychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and physiology i suspect we may be arguing about separate things only adult sensitivities you and late occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its implication for adults me certainly the doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than for the young but the additivity of glu and asp and their copious and increased presence in modern processed foods jointly and their hidden presence in hvp necessitates extreme caution why would anyone want to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the endocrine system in adults the main point is blood levels attained and oral doses would likely have to be greater than sc between who over what i would be most interested in seeing you provide peer reviewed non food industry funded citations to articles disputing that msg has no effects whatsoever you mean asserting you re being intellectually dishonest or just plain confused because you re conflating reports which do not necessarily have anything to do with each other olney s reports would argue a potential for problems in human infants but that s not to say that this says anything whatsoever about the use of msg in most foods nor does he provide any studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects for obvious reasons it says nothing about msg s contribtion to the phenomenon of the chinese restaurant syndrome it says nothing about the frequent inability to replicate anecdotal reports of msg sensitivity in the lab olney s work provides a putative causal mechanism for some sensitivities terry epelbaum and martin have shown that orally administered msg causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone fluctutations in adults glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant supression of rhythmic gh secretion and to induce rapid and transient release of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to msg gh is responsible not only for control of growth during development but also converts glycogen into glucose could this be the cause of headaches i don t know dyer ursa major spdcc com hmm com why am i not surprised dianne murray wcsbeau ccs carleton ca probably one of the dumber remarks you ve made if you had read olney s review article especially the remarks i

re barbecued foods and health risk i don t understand the assumption that because something is found to be carcinogenic that it would not be legal in the u s i think that naturally occuring substances excluding controlled substances are pretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food food additives or other consumption it s only when the chemists concoct sp an ingredient that it falls under fda regulations otherwise if they really looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everything how in the world do you suppose it s legal to consume tobacco products which probably should be banned no there is something called the delany amendment which makes carcinogenic food additives illegal in any amount this was passed by congress in the s before stuff like mass spectrometry became available which increased detectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitude this is why things like cyclamates and red were banned they are very weakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats so under the act they are banned this also applies to natural carcinogens some of you might remember a time back in the s when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so good and never tasted so good again that was the time when safrole was banned this is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leaves if it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days someone would do it in order to make money the fact that no one does it indicates that enforcement is still in effect an odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as gumbo file this is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves this is not only a natural product but a natural product still in its natural form so maybe that s how they evade delany or maybe a special exemption was made to appease powerful louisiana democrats
re is msg sensitivity superstition in article apr rtsg mot com lundby rtsg mot com walter f lundby writes as nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previous question why do you need to put msg in almost every food i must assume that my wife s answer is closer to the truth than i hoped it was i don t mean to be disrespectful to your concerns but it seems to me that you re getting all wound up in a non issue as many knowledgeable people have pointed out msg is a naturally occurring substance in a lot if not most foods when food manufacturers add it to a preparation they do so because it s a known flavor enhancer your wife s theory that msg is added to food to stimulate appetite may well be true but i don t believe it s always the reason it s added people are largely for the most part in charge of their own appetites children s and my parent s seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet food the cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other brand i have wondered if this is not a case of preference but some sort of chemical training or addiction my questions for the net are does the fda regulate the contents of pet food is it allowed for pet food to contain addictive or conditioning substances is msg put in pet food you don t know much about cats do you cats will take advantage of you resign yourself you will never understand a cat their tastes are whimsical i also suspect though it s been a while since i ve checked ingredients on commercial cat food that there are much more stringent requirements on pet food additives than human see the fda has this stupid idea that human beings have the intelligence to look out after their own interests barbara wondering how her cat would take care of her

re is msg sensitivity superstition frequently of late i have been reacting to something added to restaurant foods what happens is that the inside of my throat starts to feel puffy like i have a cold and also at times the inside of my mouth especially the tongue and lips also feel puffy the situations around these symptoms almost always involve restaurants usually chinese the most notable cases a cheap chinese fast food chain a japanese steak house i had the steak and another chinese fast food chain where i saw the cook put about a tablespoon or two of what looked like sugar or salt into my fried rice i am under the impression that msg enhances flavor by causing the taste buds to swell if this is correct i do not find it unreasonable to assume that high doses of msg can cause other mouth tissues to swell also as the many of the occurances including two of the above involved beef and as beef is frequently tenderized with msg this is what i suspect as being the cause i wouldn t be at all surprised if toxicity studies of msg in animals showed it as being harmless as it would be very startling to hear a lab rat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funny anyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives are totally harmless is welcome to e mail me with the results of any studied they know of i will probably respond to them however with a reminder of how long it took to prove that smoking causes cancer which the tobacco companies still deny dm if i sound grumpy it s because i had beef with broccoli for lunch today and now it hurts to swallow dan myers madman if the creator had intended us to walk myers usceast cs scarolina edu upright he wouldn t have given us knuckles

seizures infantile spasms the reason i m posting this article to this newsgroup is to gather any information about this disorder from anyone who might have recently been e ffected by it from being associated with it or actually having this disorder and help me find out where i can access any medical literature associated with seizures over the internet recently i had a baby boy born with seizures which occured hours after birth he was immediately transferred to a major hospital in boston and has since been undergoing extensive drug treatment for his condition this has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only in learning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing with hospitals procedures etc i don t want to go into a lot of detail but his condition was termed quite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weight as a normal baby would he was put on the standard anti convulsion drugs and that did not seem to help out his mri ekg cat scans are all normal but the eeg s show alot of seizure activity after many metabolic tests body structure tests and infection virus tests the doctors still do not know quite what type of siezures he is having although they do have alot of evidence that it is now pointing to infantile spasms this is where we stand right now if anyone knows of any database or newsgroup or as i mentioned up above any information relating to this disorder i would sure appreciate hearing from you i am not trying to play doctor here but only trying to gather information about it as i know now these particular types of disorders are still not really well understood by the medical community and so i m going to see now if somehow the internet can at least give me alittle insight thanks

bates method for myopia does the bates method work i first heard about it in this newsgroup several years ago and i have just got hold of a book how to improve your sight simple daily drills in relaxation by margaret d corbett authorized instructor of the bates method published in it talks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise has there been any study on whether this method actually works if it works is it by actually shortening the previously elongated eyeball or by increasing the lens s ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the too long eyeball since myopia is the result of eyeball elongation seems to me the most logical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the process i e shorten it somehow preferably non surgically has there been any recent studies on this where can i find them i know rk works by changing the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of eyeball but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the eyeball back to its correct length that would be even better bates s idea right thanks for any information

mind machines i recently learned about these devices that supposedly induce specific brain wave frequencies in their users simply by wearing them mind machines consist of led gogles head phones and a microprocessor that controls them they strobe the closed eye and send sound pulses in sync with the flashing leds i understand that these devices are experimental but they are available i ve heard claims that they can induce sleep and light trance states for relaxation essentially they are supposed to work without aid of drugs etc i would think that if they work as reported they would be incredibly useful the few sources i ve seen are biased they are selling the things and a friend who has tried them claims that every home should have one so do these mind machines aka light and sound machines work can they induce alpha theta and or delta waves in a person wearing them what research if any has been done on them could they be used in lieu of a tranquilizer or are they just another bit of quackery web homer homer tripos com

relief of pain caused by cancer i am not sure if this is the proper group to post this to but here goes anyway about five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes under one of her arms after the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it over the course of the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain at this time her doctor suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue while attending one of her therapy sessions while her arm was being manipulated some damage occured nerve which caused the level of pain to permanently increase severly controlled by tylenol s and some loss of use of the arm palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement with great persistence on her part the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm this was removed also but the pain in the arm has not decreased the doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed tylenol and soon morphine to relieve the pain she has tried acupuncture by this only provides minor reductions in pain and is only short term my questions are has anyone has heard of similar cases and what if anything was done to reduce the levels of pain are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated please respond by email because i do not always get chance to read this group if anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup that i should be posting this to it would also be appreciated gregory w luft internet vgwlu calgary chevron com chevron petroleum techonology company tel fifth ave s w fax calgary alberta canada t p l

re good grief was re candida albicans what is it dyer spdcc com steve dyer writes in article noringc snsx kmo netcom com noring netcom com jon noring writes there is no convincing evidence that such a disease exists there s a lot of evidence it just hasn t been adequately gathered and published in a way that will convince the die hard melancholic skeptics who quiver everytime the word anecdote or empirical is used snort ah there go my sinuses again for example dr ivker who wrote the book sinus survival always gives oh wow a classic textbook hey they laughed at einstein too before any other treatment a systemic anti fungal such as nizoral to his new patients if they ve been on braod spectrum anti biotics or more times in the last two years he s kept a record of the results and for over patients found that over of his patients get significant relief of allergic sinus symptoms of course this is only the beginning for his program yeah i ll bet tomorrow the world listen uncontrolled studies like this are worthless in my case as i reported a few weeks ago i was developing the classic symptoms outlined in the yeast connection i agree it is a poorly written book e g extreme sensitivity to plastics vapors etc which i never had before started in november within one week of full dosage of sporanox the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared i can now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes i m also greatly improved in other areas as well i m sure you are you sound like the typical hysteric hypochondriac who responds to miracle cures of course i have allergy symptoms etc i am especially allergic to molds yeasts etc it doesn t take a rocket scientist to figure out that if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body and you have a natural allergy to yeasts that a threshold would be reached where you would have perceptible symptoms yeah it makes sense to me so of course it should be taken seriously snort also yeast do produce toxins of various sorts and again you don t have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such toxins can cause problems in some people yeah it sounds reasonable to me of course the question is whether a person who is immune compromised as tests showed i was from over years of antibiotics nutritionally deficiencies because of the stress of infections and allergies etc oh really what tests immune compromised my ass more like credulous malingerer this is a psychiatric syndrome can develop excessive yeast colonization somewhere in the body it is a tough question to answer since testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy one almost has to take an empirical approach to diagnosis fortunately sporanox is relatively safe unlike past anti fungals still have to be careful however so there s no reason any longer to withhold sporanox treatment for empirical reasons you know it s a shame that a drug like itraconazole is being misused in this way it s ridiculously expensive and potentially toxic the trouble is that it isn t toxic enough so it gets abused by quacks btw some would say to try nystatin unfortunately most yeast grows hyphae too deep into tissue for nystatin to have any permanent affect you ll find a lot of people who are on nystatin all the time the only good thing about nystatin is that it s relatively cheap and when taken orally non toxic but oral nystatin is without any systemic effect so unless it were given iv it would be without any effect on your sinuses i wish these quacks would first use iv nystatin or amphotericin b on people like you that would solve the yeast problem once and for all in summary i appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep medicine on the right road but methinks that some who hold too firmly to the party line are academics who haven t been in the trenches long enough actually treating patients if anybody doctors included said to me to my face that there is no evidence of the yeast connection i cannot guarantee their safety for their incompetence ripping off their lips is justified as far as i am concerned perhaps a little haldol would go a long way towards ameliorating your symptoms are you paying for this treatment out of your own pocket i d hate to think my insurance premiums are going towards this steve dyer dyer you re rude medicine is not a totallly scientific endevour it s often practiced in a disorganized manner most early treatment of non life threatening illness is done on a guess hazarded after anecdotal evidence given by the patient it s an educated guess by a trained person but it s still no more than a guess it s cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those people who don t respond there are diseases that haven t been described yet and the root cause of many diseases now described aren t known read a book on gastroenterology sometime if you want to see a lot of them after scientific methods have run out then it s the patient s freedom of choice to try any experimental method they choose and it s well recognized by many doctors that medicine doesn t have all the answers this person said that they had relief by taking the medicine maybe it s a miracle cure maybe it s valid how do you know you might argue with the reasoning the conclusions but your disparaging attack is unwarranted why don t you present an convincing argument for you r beliefs instead of wasting our time in an ad hominem attack jackie

getting aids from acupuncture needles someone wrote in expressing concern about getting aids from acupuncture needles unless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who themselves has aids it is unlikely not impossible they will get aids from acupuncture needles generally even if accidently inoculated the normal immune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant involved with acupuncture needle insertion most acupuncturists use disposable needles use once and throw away they do this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of diseases via this route so it s good business to advertise disposable needlesused here these needles tend to be of a lower quality however being poorly manufactured and too sharp in my opinion they tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles if i choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint that patient will get their own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments the risk here for hepatitis hiv etc transmission is that i could mistakenly use an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong patient but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates this risk better quality needles tend to slide past vessels and nerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags and hematomas so i use them acupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses but they are all solid when compared to their injection style cousins in china herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into meridian points purported to have tcm physiologic effects and so require the same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine this means thinkingtiny that a samll amount of tissue the diameter of the needle bore will be injected into the body as it would be in a typical shot when the skin is puntured on the other hand when the solid acupuncture needle is inserted the skin tends to squeeze the needle from the tip to the level of insertion such that any cooties that haven t been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion tend to remain on the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior of course in tcm the body s exterior is protected by the wei protective qi so infection is unlikely or in other words there is a normal inflammatory and immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture site while i m fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease transmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion i would like to know for what complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist not to know if it would be harmful but to know if it would be helpful john badanes dc ca romdas uclink berkeley edu

after declining steadily during the s in comparison in the united states reported cases of gonorrhea in continued an overall decreasing trend this report summarizes an analysis of the increase in gonorrhea in colorado in and characterizes trends in the occurrence of this disease from through in cases of gonorrhea were reported to the colorado department of health cdh compared with cases reported in during reported cases increased and among females and males respectively table similar increases occurred among blacks whites and hispanics and respectively however the number of reported cases with race not specified increased from to and constituted of all reported cases in although the largest proportional increases by age groups occurred among persons aged years and greater than or equal to years these age groups accounted for only of all reported cases in persons in the year age group accounted for the largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during and the highest age group specific rate per reported cases of gonorrhea increased in the five county denver metropolitan area population but decreased elsewhere in the state table half the cases of gonorrhea in the denver metropolitan area occurred in of the census tracts these represent neighborhoods considered by sexually transmitted diseases stds acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity when compared with the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among men in the denver metro health clinic dmhc the primary public std clinic in the denver metropolitan area increased in and the number of visits by males to the clinic increased concurrently the number of cases diagnosed among women increased by among self identified heterosexual men the number of

ne spencer msph std aids program re hoffman md state epidemiologist colorado dept of health jm douglas md denver dept of health and hospitals surveillance and information systems br div of sexually transmitted diseases and hiv prevention national center for prevention svcs cdc editorial note the increase in reported gonorrhea cases in colorado in may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by cdh surveillance staff during the increases in confirmed gonorrhea cases at dmhc and in culture positivity rates in three of four laboratories suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact however the stable culture positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning laboratory which serves a network of clinics statewide indicates that the gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population one possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado may be gang and drug related sexual behavior as implicated in a recent outbreak of drug resistant gonorrhea and other stds in colorado springs although the high morbidity census tracts in the denver metropolitan area coincide with areas of gang and drug activity this hypothesis requires further assessment to examine the possible role of drug use implicated previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis the cdh std aids program is collecting information from all persons in whom gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use exchange of sex for money or drugs and gang affiliation the gonorrhea rate for blacks in colorado substantially exceeds the national health objective for the year per objective a race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for gonorrhea and other stds risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at greatest risk for stds and for targeting prevention efforts moreover race specific variation in std rates may reflect differences in factors such as socioeconomic status access to medical care and high risk behaviors in response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado interventions initiated by the cdh std aids program include targeting partner notification in the denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at increased risk e g year old black females and year

effectiveness in disease and injury prevention impact of adult safety belt use on restraint use among children less than years of age selected states and source mmwr date apr motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among children and young adults in the united states and account for more than million years of potential life lost before age annually child safety seats and safety belts can substantially reduce this loss from through all states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety belts for children although these laws reduce injuries to young children by an estimated motor vehicle crash related injuries remain a major cause of disability and death among u s children while the use of occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age usage for those aged years aged years and aged years in addition parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to use restraints for their children to characterize the association between adult safety belt use and adult reported consistent use of occupant restraints for the youngest child aged less than years within a household cdc analyzed data obtained from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system brfss during and this report summarizes the findings from this study data were available for respondents aged greater than or equal to years in states that participated in brfss a population based random digit dialed telephone survey and administered a standard injury control and child safety module developed by cdc of these respondents had a child aged less than years in their household each respondent was asked to specify the child s age and the frequency of restraint use for that child the two categories of child restraint and adult safety belt use in this analysis were consistent use i e always buckle up and less than consistent use i e almost always sometimes rarely or never buckle up data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state software for survey data analysis sudaan was used to calculate point estimates and confidence intervals statistically significant differences were defined by p values of less than each of the states had some type of child restraint law of these six arizona kentucky maine nebraska rhode island and west virginia had no law requiring adults to use safety belts four idaho maryland pennsylvania and washington had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety belt law i e a vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse of safety belts could be issued and one state new york had a primary enforcement mandatory safety belt law i e vehicles could be stopped for a safety belt law violation alone in nine states child passenger protection hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april laws included all children aged less than years but the other two states used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use the analysis in this report subgrouped states into those having a law requiring adult safety belt use law states and those without such a law no law states overall of children aged less than years reportedly were not consistently restrained during automobile travel both child restraint use and adult restraint use were significantly higher p less than chi square test in law states than in no law states versus and versus respectively high rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than consistent safety belt use figure adults with consistent use reported high rates of child occupant restraint use regardless of the child s age range for year olds to for year olds in comparison for adults reporting less than consistent safety belt use the rate of child occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child range for year olds to for year olds when comparing children of consistent adult safety belt users with children of less than consistent adult safety belt users confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age groups i e aged less than and year reported child occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded that in no law states regardless of age of child table in addition higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with increased restraint use for children a factor that has also been associated with increased adult safety belt use reported by national center for injury prevention and control national center for chronic disease prevention and health promotion cdc editorial note the findings in this report are consistent with others indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to employ occupant restraints for their children because these nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit other risk taking behaviors children traveling with them may be at greater risk for motor vehicle injury educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with child restraint use in this report accordingly occupant protection programs should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment because low educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status such programs should be offered to adults through health care facilities that serve low income communities or through federal programs i e head start that are directed at parents with young children injury prevention programs emphasize restraining young children in addition however efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april they become older parents especially those with low educational attainment those who do not consistently wear safety belts and those from states that do not have mandatory safety belt use laws should be encouraged to wear safety belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and safety belts finally the increased use of restraints among children may increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers the age group characterized by the

birth defects surveillance in metropolitan atlanta georgia and selected jurisdictions in california for the years description of system the california birth defects monitoring program and the metropolitan atlanta congenital defects program are two population based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods the prevalence estimates for diagnostic categories were based on data for for births in california and births in metropolitan atlanta the prevalences in the two areas were compared adjusting for race sex and maternal age by using poisson regression results regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis fetal alcohol syndrome hip dislocation dysplasia microcephalus obstruction of the kidney ureter and scoliosis lordosis may be attributable to general diagnostic variability however differences in the prevalences of arm hand limb reduction encephalocele spina bifida or trisomy down syndrome are probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment because these defects are relatively easy to diagnose interpretation regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination may affect prevalences of trisomy and spina bifida however the reason for differences in arm hand reduction is unknown but may be related to variability in environmental exposure heterogeneity in the gene pool or random variation actions taken because of the similarities of these data bases several collaborative studies are being implemented in particular the differences in the birth prevalence of spina bifida and down syndrome will focus

h n and b viruses were identified in the united states with essentially equal frequency overall although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted over the course of the season throughout the season increases in the indices of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza a h n predominated were similar to increases in regions where influenza b predominated only of identified viruses were influenza a h n but isolations of this subtype increased as the season waned and it subsequently predominated during the season during the season outbreaks in nursing homes were reported in association with influenza b and a h n but not influenza a h n interpretation the alternating temporal and geographic predominance of influenza strains a h n and b during the season emphasizes the importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance since amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza a actions taken weekly interim

of arizona high tech assisted reproductive technologies following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization embryo transfer ivf et baby in a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been developed that include ivf et gamete intrafallopian tube transfer gift embryo cryopreservation freezing and gamete micromanipulation together these technologies are referred to as the high tech assisted reproductive technology art procedures ovulation induction sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and or pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility management however when these fail it almost always is appropriate to proceed with one of the art procedures therefore in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility service at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility there is a program of assisted reproduction that specializes in art procedures this program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients in the state of arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the traditional therapies the following article on back describes the art procedures available in our center clarifies appropriate applications for each and considers the realistic expectations for their success procedures included are o in vitro o fertilization embryo transfer ivf et gamete intrafallopian tube transfer o gift cryopreservation of human embryos and gamete micromanipulation this article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed towards improved success of these technologies hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april future areas of research in addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the management of infertile couples we are developing the technology to assist couples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary disease this technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either dna amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization there are recent reports of the successful application of dna amplification by other centers for example for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and hemophilia we hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ hybridization technology for probing the x chromosome the identification of which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit sex linked disorders the considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis in addition to the possibility of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses in order to avoid the birth of affected children catherine racowsky ph d associate professor and director of research department of obstetrics and gynecology college of medicine university of arizona tucson arizona applications success rates and advances for the management of infertility the following are the art procedures available at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility in vitro fertilization embryo transfer is the core art procedure of our assisted reproduction program this procedure involves retrieval of unfertilized eggs from the ovary their insemination in vitro in a dish and the culture of resultant embryos for or days before they are transferred to the patient s uterus all cultures are maintained in an incubator under strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions before being processed for use in insemination semen samples are evaluated in our andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april assisted semen analyses to ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to perform ivf et or indeed gift follicular development is typically stimulated with gonadotropins perganol metrodin gonadotropin releasing hormone gnrh factrel lutrepulse and or gnrh analogues lupron depo lupron synarel occasionally however ivf et is accomplished with eggs obtained in non stimulated cycles while some programs utilize laparoscopic egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound guided retrieval in our infertility unit with the patient sedated couples who resort to ivf et exhibit such pathologies as tubal deficiencies ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis and or mild forms of male factor infertility according to the united states ivf registry the overall success rate for ivf et nationwide has stabilized at about percent per cycle results from our program involving patients who have undergone ivf et cycles reflect a comparable success rate nevertheless the overall incidence of success with this procedure is disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies well recognized predictors of outcome include patient age response to exogenous ovarian stimulation quality of sperm and number of repeated ivf et cycle attempts however among these age is the single most significant determinant of conception therefore it is critical that such patients are referred to an assisted reproduction program at the earliest opportunity following failure of traditional therapies the underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not been clearly delineated beyond recognition that the number of eggs available for retrieval declines markedly with age fertilization rates significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over years and provided the appropriate hormonal background is present age is unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy ongoing research in our center therefore is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may be impacted by age we have determined that more than percent of eggs that fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal and that a significant proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age currently the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor our program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy gift this high tech art procedure is performed in the operating room usually with the use of a laparoscope and in contrast to ivf et involves introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the fallopian tube an average of eggs tube under these circumstances fertilization occurs in vivo and if excess eggs are retrieved the remainder undergo ivf with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle or freezing for transfer in a subsequent cycle this art procedure is applied to cases in hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april which there is at least one patent fallopian tube but the couple has such pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis male factor infertility and or idiopathic infertility the data reported in the united states ivf registry for through indicate that the overall success rate with gift is higher than that obtained with the ivf et technique range of clinical pregnancies for gift is to percent and for ivf et to percent in view of this fact one might expect more patients to be treated with gift than ivf et however in our program we have taken into account three basic concerns which while substantially reducing the number of gift cycles performed benefit the patient these concerns are the increased costs associated with performing a procedure in the operating room the risks albeit minimal of undergoing general anesthesia and the considerable benefits to be accrued from obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs and the developmental competency of resultant embryos the increased success with gift undoubtedly reflects the artificial environment provided by the laboratory in the ivf et procedure between january and december we have performed a total of gift cycles with an overall success rate of percent embryo cryopreservation or freezing is applied in our program when embryos result from residual gift eggs or from non transferred ivf embryos this procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for success at much reduced costs but also circumvents the legal and ethical issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos therefore as stipulated by the american fertility society ethical guidelines for art programs from both a practical and an ethical standpoint all assisted reproduction programs should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys gamete micromanipulation this art procedure which is still very new is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but who have severe male factor infertility less than million sperm ml in combination with fewer than perccent motile sperm and or less than percent sperm with normal morphology we are currently developing the procedure of sub zonal insertion szi which entails injecting sperm under the coating around the egg the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm through enzymatic digestion available data from szi programs world wide indicate that only to percent of szi cycles result in a pregnancy this statistic undoubtedly relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm therefore we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation such efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to establish conception catherine racowsky ph d hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april associate professor and director of research department

around microbial resistance he said any delay would signify questions over safety and resistance rather than a lack of funds fauci who co authored one of the two papers published last week in nature rejects the argument by one of his co authors cecil fox that the new discovery indicates that billion spent on vaccine trials has been a waste of time and money because the trials were started too

office of alternative medicine at the national institutes of health has raised questions about the nih s commitment to an effort that uses unorthodox or holistic therapeutic methods the oam is a small division of the nih with its budget only at million dollars compared to more than billion for the nih as a whole in addition the money for available research grants is even smaller about to total will be available this year for or grants kaiya montaocean of the center for natural and traditional medicine in washington d c says the oam is afraid to become involved in aids they have to look successful and there is no easy answer in aids she said there is also a common perception that the oam will focus on fields the nih establishment will find non threatening such as relaxation techniques and acupuncture when the oam called for an advisory committee conference of about people last year the aids community was largely missing from the meeting in addition activists general lack of contact with the office has added suspicion that the epidemic will be ignored jon greenberg of act up new york said the oam advisory panel is composed of practitioners without real research experience it will take them several years to accept the nature of research nevertheless dr leanna standish research director and aids investigator at the bastyr college of naturopathic medicine in

the first time scientists have indicated that natural killer cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack according to anthony l komaroff a researcher with harvard medical school despite the test tube findings scientists are uncertain whether the same result occurs in the body lusso s team also found that herpesvirus produces the cd receptor molecule that provides access for hiv cd t

politicians understand the dimensions of certain health problems but also to be committed to related policies write george gellert and dale f nordenberg of the orange county health care agency santa ana calif and the emory university school of public health in atlanta ga respectively dr berkley s editorial on why american doctors should care about the aids epidemic beyond the united states details several reasons for the concerted interest that all countries share in combating aids it should be noted that while aids leads in hastening global health interdependence it is not the only illness doing so diseases such as malaria and many respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations berkley mentions the enormous social and economic impact that aids will have on many developing countries and the increased need for international assistance that will result berkley also cites the lack of political aggressiveness toward the aids epidemic in its first decade but now there is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in approach to international health and development in general and hiv aids in particular vice president al gore proposes in his book earth in the balance a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable international development with programs to promote literacy improve child survival and disseminate contraceptive technology and access throughout the developing world if enacted this change in policy could drastically change the future of worldwide health aids and priorities in the global village in reply journal of the american hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april medical association vol no p berkley seth every nation should tackle hiv as early and aggressively as possible before the disease reaches an endemic state even at a cost of diverting less attention to some other illnesses writes seth berkley of the rockefeller foundation in new york n y in reply to a letter by drs gellert and nordenberg although it is true that diseases other than aids such as malaria and respiratory and intestinal illnesses have similarly inhibited economic development in developing countries and deserve much more attention than they are getting berkley disagrees with the contention that aids is receiving too much attention hiv differs from other diseases in most developing countries because it is continuing to spread for most endemic diseases the outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another year of about the same level of needless disease and death but with aids and its increasing spread the cost of neglect not only in disease burden but financially is much greater interventions in the early part of a rampantly spreading epidemic like hiv are highly cost effective because each individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission berkley says he agrees with gellert and nordenberg about the gigantic social and economic effects of aids and about the need for political leadership but he concludes that not only is assertive political leadership needed in the united states for the aids epidemic but even more so in developing countries with high rates of hiv infection and where complacency about the epidemic has been the rule hicnet medical newsletter page volume

infected children the national institutes of health has opened the first trial of experimental hiv vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus hiv the virus that causes aids the trial will compare the safety of three hiv experimental vaccines in children recruited from at least sites nationwide volunteers must be hiv infected but have no symptoms of hiv disease hhs secretary donna e shalala said this initial study can be seen as a hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of hiv infected children who now face the certainty they will develop aids anthony s fauci m d director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases and of the nih office of aids research said the trial is the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay disease progression in children with hiv who are not yet sick if these vaccines prove to be safe more sophisticated questions about their therapeutic potential will be assessed in phase ii trials the centers for disease control and prevention estimates children in the united states have hiv by the end of the decade the world health organization projects million children will be infected worldwide the study will enroll children ages month to years old niaid which funds the aids clinical trials group network anticipates conducting the trial at nine actg sites around the country and three sites participating in the actg but funded by the national institute of child health and human development preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows that certain vaccines can boost existing hiv specific immune responses and hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april stimulate new ones it will be several years however before researchers know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease the results from the pediatric trial known as actg will be examined closely for other reasons as well this trial will provide the first insight into how the immature immune system responds to candidate hiv vaccines said daniel hoth m d director of niaid s division of aids we need this information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent hiv infection in children in the united states most hiv infected children live in poor inner city areas and more than percent are minorities mainly black or hispanic nearly all hiv infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during pregnancy or at birth an infected mother in the united states has more than a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby as growing numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to hiv through injection drug use or infected sexual partners researchers expect a corresponding increase in the numbers of infected children hiv disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults the most recent information suggests that percent of infants born with hiv develop a serious aids related infection by to years of age these infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of childhood that can result in seizures pneumonia diarrhea and other symptoms leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays at least half of the children in the trial will be years of age or younger to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older participants all volunteers must have well documented hiv infection but no symptoms of hiv disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen liver or spleen they cannot have received any anti retroviral or immune regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study study chair john s lambert m d of the university of rochester medical school and co chair samuel katz m d of duke university school of medicine will coordinate the trial assisted by james mcnamara m d medical officer in the pediatric medicine branch of niaid s division of aids we will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children for any side effects to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or fevers for example than another said dr mcnamara we ll also look at whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other significant laboratory or clinical effects he emphasized that the small study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april products the trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from recombinant hiv proteins these so called subunit vaccines each genetically engineered to contain only a piece of the virus have so far proved well tolerated in ongoing trials in hiv infected adults one vaccine made by microgenesys inc of meriden conn contains gp a protein that gives rise to hiv s surface proteins plus alum adjuvant adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine presently alum is the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the food and drug administration both of the other vaccines one made by genentech inc of south san francisco and the other by biocine a joint venture of chiron and ciba geigy in emeryville calif contain the major hiv surface protein gp plus adjuvant the genentech vaccine contains alum while the biocine vaccine contains mf an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in other phase i vaccine trials in adults a low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in children twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the experimental vaccine and three children will be given adjuvant alone considered the placebo neither the health care workers nor the children will be told what they receive if the low dose is well tolerated controlled testing of a higher dose of the experimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of children will begin each child will receive six immunizations one

april new evidence that the hiv can cause disease independently news from the national institute of dental research there is new evidence that the human immunodeficiency virus can cause disease independently of its ability to suppress the immune system say scientists at the national institues of health they report that hiv itself not an opportunistic infection caused scaling skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for hiv although the hiv genes were active in the mice they did not compromise the animals immunity the researchers found this led them to conclude that the hiv itself caused the skin disease our findings support a growing body of evidence that hiv can cause disease without affecting the immune system said lead author dr jeffrey kopp of the national institute of dental research nidr dr kopp and his colleagues described their study in the march issue of aids research and human retroviruses developing animal models of hiv infection has been difficult since most animals including mice cannot be infected by the virus to bypass this problem scientists have developed hiv transgenic mice which carry genes for hiv as well as their own genetic material nidr scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting hiv genes into mouse eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice the resulting litters contained both normal and transgenic animals institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of hiv genetic material in l those mice however became sick and died too soon after birth to study in depth in the present study the scientists used an incomplete copy of hiv which allowed the animals to live longer some of the transgenic animals developed scaling wart like tumors on their necks and backs other transgenic mice developed thickened crusting skin lesions that covered most of their bodies resembling psoriasis in humans no skin lesions developed in their normal non transgenic littermates studies of tissue taken from the wart like skin tumors showed that they were a type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma although the papillomavirus can cause these skin lesions laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the animals tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the presence of a protein producing molecule made by the hiv genetic material hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april evidence of hiv protein production proved that the viral genes were turned on or active said dr kopp the scientists found no evidence however of compromised immunity in the mice no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common infections the fact that hiv genes were active but the animals immune systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the skin lesions dr kopp said further proof of hiv gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light the light increased hiv genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin papilloma formation in response to increased hiv genetic activity proved the genes were responsible for the skin condition the scientists said no lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the uv light the transgenic mice used in this study were developed at nidr by dr peter dickie who is now with the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases collaborating on the study with dr kopp were mr charles wohlenberg drs nickolas dorfman joseph bryant abner notkins and paul klotman all of nidr dr stephen katz of the national

s u s department of health and human services march hhs secretary donna e shalala today announced the first nationwide clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care professionals who have questions about providing care to people with hiv infection or aids the toll free national hiv telephone consulting service is staffed by a physician a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist it provides information on drugs clinical trials and the latest treatment methods the service is funded by the health resources and services administration and operates out of san francisco general hospital secretary shalala said one goal of this project is to share expertise so patients get the best care a second goal is to get more primary health care providers involved in care for people with hiv or aids which reduces treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and community social support networks currently many providers refer patients with hiv or aids to specialists or other providers who have more experience secretary shalala said this clinical expertise should be especially helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with hiv or aids in communities and clinical sites where hiv expertise is not readily available the telephone number for health care professionals is and it is accessible from a m to p m est a m to p m pst monday through friday during these times consultants will try to answer questions immediately or within an hour at other times physicians and health care providers can leave an electronic message and questions will be answered as quickly as possible health care professionals may call the service to ask any question related to providing hiv care including the latest hiv aids drug treatment information clinical trials information subspecialty case referral literature searches and other information the service is designed for health care professionals rather than patients families or others who have alternate sources of information or materials when a health care professional calls the new service the call is taken by either a clinical pharmacist primary care physician or family nurse practitioner all staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and inpatient primary care for people with hiv related diseases the consultant asks for patient specific information including cd cell count current medications sex age and the patient s hiv history this national service has grown out of a month local effort that hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april responded to nearly calls from health care providers in northern california the initial project was funded by hrsa s bureau of health professions through its community provider aids training cpat project and by the american academy of family physicians when providers expand their knowledge they also improve the quality of care they are able to provide to their patients said hrsa administrator robert g harmon m d m p h this project will be a great resource for health care professionals and the hiv aids patients they serve this service has opened a new means of communication between health care professionals and experts on hiv care management said hrsa s associate administrator for aids and director of the bureau of health resources development g stephen bowen m d m p h providers who

of the scanned image i like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which parts of the document i would like scanned and in what order once an image is scanned you can bring up the pop up image verification the software gives you two errors at this point blue which are words that were converted reliability but do not match anything in the built in dictionary yellow shade which are words that wordscan plus doesn t think it converted correctly at all i have found that the software should give itself more credit it is usually correct instead of wrong if a word is shaded blue you can add it to your personal dictionary the only problem is the personal dictionary will only handle about words i find this to be very limited considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary after a document is converted you can save it in a multitude of word processor formats also any images that were captured can be stored in a seperate tiff or pcx file format i was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files i use hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april an intel satisfaxtion card which stores incoming faxs in a pcx dcx format while most

problem infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the united states since the early s the u s public health system has been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes e g escherichia coli o h hepatitis c virus human immunodeficiency virus legionnaires disease lyme disease and toxic shock syndrome the incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control such as cholera malaria and tuberculosis tb have increased in many areas furthermore control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea malaria pneumococcal disease salmonellosis shigellosis tb and staphylococcal infections emerging infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons those in institutional settings e g hospitals and child day care centers and minority and underserved populations the substantial economic burden of emerging infections on the u s health care system could be reduced by more effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs this issue of mmwr introduces a new series emerging

center for infectious diseases cdc editorial note e coli o h is a pathogenic gram negative bacterium first identified as a cause of illness in during an outbreak of severe bloody diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers this pathogen has since emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and hus the most common cause of acute renal failure in children outbreak investigations have linked most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef although other food vehicles including roast beef raw milk and apple cider also have been implicated preliminary data from a cdc year nationwide multicenter study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for e coli o h that organism was isolated more frequently than shigella in four of participating hospitals and was isolated from of all bloody stools a higher rate than for any other pathogen infection with e coli o h often is not recognized because most clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april smac medium and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses associated with infection the usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea often bloody and abdominal cramps fever is infrequent younger age groups and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and complications illness usually resolves after days but of patients develop hus which is characterized by hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia renal failure and a death rate of this report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community outbreaks of e coli o h in the absence of routine surveillance despite the magnitude of this outbreak the problem may not have been recognized in three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in washington clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from persons with bloody diarrhea or hus for e coli o h using smac agar when infections with e coli o h are identified they should be reported to local health departments for further evaluation and if necessary public health action to prevent further cases e coli o h lives in the intestines of healthy cattle and can contaminate meat during slaughter cdc is collaborating with the u s department of agriculture s food safety inspection service to identify critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce the likelihood of pathogens such as e coli o h entering the meat supply because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with pathogens and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens from the surface of the meat to the interior ground beef is likely to be internally contaminated the optimal food protection practice is to cook ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink and the juices are clear in this outbreak undercooking of hamburger patties likely played an important role the food and drug administration fda has issued interim recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to f c fda personal communication regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of outbreaks the public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections caused by e coli o h and for hus to better define the epidemiology of e coli

and virility use of oral snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players encouraging this behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for nicotine addiction oral cancer and other mouth disorders differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among racial ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require further explanation for example targeted marketing practices may play a role in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups and affecting the differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons in this report one concern is that nearly one fourth of current smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes in the

serious asthma attacks american lung association a new study published by the american lung association has shown that surprisingly low concentrations of airborne particles can send people with asthma rushing to emergency rooms for treatment the seattle based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution the actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed unsafe under federal air quality laws people with asthma have inflamed airways and airborne particles tend to exacerbate that inflammation said joel schwartz ph d of the environmental protection agency who was the lead author of the study when people are on the threshold of having a serious asthma attack particles can push them over the edge the seattle study correlated months of asthma emergency room visits with daily levels of pm or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of microns or less these finer particles are considered hazardous because they are small enough penetrate into the lung cities are considered out of compliance with clean air laws if the hour average concentration of pm exceeds micrograms per cubic millimeter of air in seattle however a link between fine particles and asthma was found at levels as low as micrograms the authors concluded that for every microgram increase in the four day average of pm the odds of someone with asthma needing emergency treatment increased by percent the findings were published in the april american review of respiratory disease an official journal of the american thoracic society the lung association s medical section the study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat a study by dr schwartz and douglas dockery ph d of harvard found that particles may be causing roughly premature deaths each year in the united states other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms and bronchitis in children government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone says dr schwartz but more and more research is showing that particles are bad actors as well one problem in setting standards for particulate air pollution is that pmio is difficult to study unlike other regulated pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide particulate matter is a complex and varying mixture of substances including carbon hydrocarbons dust and hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april acid aerosols researchers can t put people in exposure chambers to study the effects of particulate air pollution says dr schwartz we have no way of duplicating the typical urban mix of particles consequently most of what is known about particulates has been learned through population based research like the seattle study given that the epa s current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur dioxide standards the agency is unlikely to reexamine the pm standard any time soon until changes are made there appears to be little people with asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles in some areas you can get reports on air quality but the reports only cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard and that s rarely particulate matter says dr schwartz however pm doesn t have to be near its violation range to be unhealthy hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april nih consensus development conference on melanoma the national institutes of health consensus development conference on diagnosis and treatment of early melanoma brought together experts in dermatology pathology epidemiology public education surveillance techniques and potential new technologies as well as other health care professionals and the public to address the clinical and histological characteristics of early melanoma the appropriate diagnosis management and followup of patients with early melanoma the role of dysplastic nevi and their significance and the role of education and screening in preventing melanoma morbidity and mortality following days of presentations by experts and discussion by the audience a consensus panel weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement among their findings the panel recommended that melanoma in situ is a distinct entity effectively treated surgically with centimeter margins thin invasive melanoma less than millimeter thick has the potential for long term survival in more than percent of patients after surgical excision with a centimeter margin elective lymph node dissections and extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for melanoma and should be enrolled in

medical newsletter page volume number april nci designated cancer centers the cancer centers program is comprised of nci designated cancer centers actively engaged in multidisciplinary research efforts to reduce cancer incidence morbidity and mortality within the program there are four types of cancer centers basic science cancer centers which engage primarily in basic cancer research clinical cancer centers which focus on clinical research comprehensive cancer centers which emphasize a multidisciplinary approach to cancer research patient care and community outreach and consortium cancer centers which specialize in cancer prevention and control research although some cancer centers existed in the late s and the s it was the national cancer act of that authorized the establishment of new cancer centers as well as continuing support for existing ones the passage of the act also dramatically transformed the centers structure and broadened the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic clinical and cancer control research over the next two decades the centers program grew progressively in there were comprehensive cancer centers in the nation today there are of these institutions all of which meet specific nci criteria for comprehensive status to attain recognition from the nci as a comprehensive cancer center an institution must pass rigorous peer review under guidelines newly established in the eight criteria for comprehensiveness include the requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in several scientific fields such as biology and molecular genetics a strong program of clinical research and an ability to transfer research findings into clinical practice moreover five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly beyond that required for attaining a cancer center support grant also referred to as a p or core grant the mechanism of choice for supporting the infrastructure of a cancer center s operations these criteria encompass strong participation in nci designated high priority clinical trials significant levels of cancer prevention and control research and important outreach and educational activities all of which are funded by a variety of sources the other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit important new findings or address timely research questions hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april of the nci designated cancer centers are of the basic science type these centers engage almost entirely in basic research although some centers engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications from new discoveries in the laboratory clinical cancer centers in contrast focus on both basic research and clinical research within the same institutional framework and frequently incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their overall research programs there are such centers today finally consortium cancer centers of which there is one are uniquely structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and control research these centers interface with state and local public health departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions responsible for implementing population wide public health programs consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials together the nci designated cancer centers continue to work toward creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research and through interdisciplinary efforts to effectively move this research

project said shalala administration sources subsequently confirmed that nih director dr bernadine healy and food and drug administration commissioner david kessler had convinced the white house that

noordewier rutgers university this overview of the essential facts of molecular biology is intended as an introduction to the field for computer scientists who wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex domain material covered will include structural and informational molecules the basic organization of the cell and of genetic material the central dogma of gene expression and selected other topics in the area of structure function and regulation as relates to current computational approaches dr noordewier has appointments in both computer science and biology at rutgers and has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition to his current work in computational biology pm introduction to artificial intelligence for biologists dr richard lathrop mit arris corp an overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be presented as it relates to actual and potential biological applications fundamental techniques symbolic programming languages and notions of search will be discussed as well as selected topics in somewhat greater detail such as knowledge representation inference and machine learning the intended audience includes biologists with some computational background but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence dr lathrop co developer of ariadne and related technologies has worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to biological problems in both academia and industry pm neural networks statistics and information theory in biological sequence analysis dr alan lapedes los alamos national laboratory this tutorial will cover the most rapidly expanding facet of intelligent systems for molecular biology that of machine learning techniques applied to sequence analysis closely interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general characteristics of sequences and the relationship of such approaches to statistical techniques and information theoretic views of sequence data dr lapedes of the theoretical division at los alamos has long been a leader in the use of such techniques in this domain pm genetic algorithms and genetic programming prof john koza stanford university the genetic algorithm an increasingly popular approach to highly non linear multi dimensional optimization problems was originally inspired by a biological metaphor this tutorial will cover both the biological motivations and the actual implementation and characteristics of the algorithm genetic programming an extension well suited to problems where the discovery of the size and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem will also be addressed particular attention will be paid to biological applications and to identifying resources and software that will permit attendees to begin using the methods dr koza a consulting professor of computer science at stanford has taught this subject since and is the author of a standard text in the field pm linguistic methods in sequence analysis prof david searls university of pennsylvania shmuel pietrokovski weizmann institute approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies are increasingly in evidence these involve the adaptation of tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic pattern recognition and gene prediction the classification of genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory the identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes in sequence data and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and functional relatedness dr searls who holds research faculty appointments in both genetics and computer science at penn represents the branch of this field that considers higher order syntactic approaches to sequence data while shmuel pietrokovski has studied and published with prof edward trifinov in the area of word based analyses registration form mail with check made out to ismb to ismb conference c o

candida yeast bloom fact or fiction i can not believe the way this thread on candida yeast has progressed steve dyer and i have been exchanging words over the same topic in sci med nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did not exist calling this physician a quack was reprehensible steve and i see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well let me tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with it s environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics these are the physicians who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go from doctor to doctor to find relief like elaine in sci med nutrition and then when they find one that solves their problem the rest start yelling quack could it just be professional jealousy i couldn t help elaine or jon but somebody else did could they know more than me no way they must be a quack i ve been teaching a human nutrition course for medical students for over ten years now and guess who the most receptive students are those that were raised on farms and saw first hand the effect of diet on the health of their farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to entering medical school switched to the vegan diet typically this is about of my class of students those not interested in nutrition either tune me out or just stop coming to class that s okay because i know that some of what i m teaching is going to stick and there will be at least a few enlightened physicians practicing in the u s it s really too bad that most u s medical schools don t cover nutrition because if they did candida would not be viewed as a non disease by so many in the medical profession in animal husbandry an animal is reinnoculated with good bacteria after antibiotics are stopped medicine has decided that since humans do not have a ruminant stomach no such reinnoculation with good bacteria is needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the gi system mouth stomach small and large intestine sinuses vagina and on the skin these are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised they are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body but any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body a poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin a is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier steve got real upset with elaine s doctor because he was using anti fungals and vitamin a for her gi problems if steve really understoood what vitamin a does in the body he would not or at least should not be calling elaine s doctor a quack here is a brief primer on yeast yeast infections as they are commonly called are not truely caused by yeasts the most common organism responsible for this type of infection is candida albicans or monilia which is actually a yeast like fungus an infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis candidiasis is a very rare occurance because like an e coli infection it requires that the host immune system be severly depressed candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing factor is present such as a high blood glucose level diabetes or an oral course of antibiotics has been used in diabetics their secretions contain much higher amounts of glucose candida unlike bacteria is very limited in it s food fuel selection without glucose it can not grow it just barely survives if it gets access to a lot of glucose it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses gi tract or vagina in diabetics skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little buggers the bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isn t certain when the bloom is in the vagina or on the skin it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to treat it if it s internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondiscript candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses the gi tract mouth stomach and intestines and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food the human immune system ususally does not bother itself with these nonpathogenic organisms unless they broach the mucus membrane barrier if they do an inflammatory response will be set up most americans are not getting enough vitamin a from their diets about of all american s die with less vitamin a than they were born with u s autopsy studies while this low level of vitamin a does not cause pathology blindness it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system this would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom while diabetics can suffer from a candida bloom the most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned while drugs are available to handle candida many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection the toxicity of the anti fungal drugs does warrant some caution but if the gi or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candida and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun then anti fungal use should be approrpriate just as the anti fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections in spite of what mr steve dyer says but even in patients being given the anti fungals the irritation caused by the excessive candida bloom in the sinus gi tract or the vagina tends to return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of the problem is addressed lack of a good bacterial flora in the body and or poor mucus membrane barrier lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective therapy for candida overgrowth from it s name it is an acid loving organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows candida can not grow very well in an acidic environment in the vagina l acidophilius is the predominate bacteria unless you are hit with broad spectrum antibiotics in the gi system the ano rectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer through moisture and humidity of candida to the vaginal tract one of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear if the bloom occurs in the anal area the burning swelling pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids if the bloom manages to move further up the gi tract very diffuse symptomatology occurs abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool this positive stool for occult blood is what sent elaine to her family doctor in the first place after extensive testing he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt on to another doctor and so on richard kaplan has told me throiugh e mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positives candida blooms guys if my gut hurt me on a constant basis i would want it fixed yes it s nice to know that i don t have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress when i finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me better steve dyer calls him a quack candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment the vagina becomes alkaline during a woman s period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal problems many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract i would want to be sure of the purity of the product before trying this my wife had this vagina problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting scripts for anti fungal creams this was a woman gynocologist who had had the same problem recurring vaginal yeast infections this m d did some digging and came up with an acetic acid and l acidophilis douche which she used in your office to keep it sterile after three treatments sex returned to our marraige i have often wondered what an m d with chronic gi distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a non existent syndrome the nonpathogenic bacteria l acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women if taken orally it can also become a major bacteria in the gut through aresol sprays it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes but before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened this is accomplished by vitamin a vitamin c and some of the b complex vitamins diet surveys repeatedly show that americans are not getting enough b and folate these are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this non existent disorder candida blooms after antibiotic therapy some of the above material was obtained from natural healing by mark bricklin published by rodale press as well as notes from my human nutrition course i will be posting a discussion of vitamin a sometime in the future along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin a plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin a should be effective in dealing with candida blooms another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase this is especially important if the gi system is involved if candida can not get glucose it s not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the gut if steve and some of the other nay sayers want to jump all over this post fine i jumped all over steve in sci med nutrition because he verbably accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor s use of vitamin a and anti fungals for a candida bloom in her gut people seeking advice from newsnet should not be treated this way those of us giving of our time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart s content if you

if any will be med related in article banschbach vms ocom okstate edu writes i can not believe the way this thread on candida yeast has progressed steve dyer and i have been exchanging words over the same topic in sci med nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a woman poster for being treated by a licenced physician for a disease that did not exist calling this physician a quack was reprehensible steve and i see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well they are just responding in their natural way hyper choleric syndrome hcs oops that is not a recognized illness in the psychological community better not say that since it therefore must not and never will exist actually it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians will type out as nt for those not familiar with the myers briggs system just e mail me and i ll send a summary file to you in the general population nt s comprise only about of the population but among physicians it is much much higher i don t know the exact percentage any help here a p p er s one driving characteristic of an nt especially an ntj is their obvious choleric behavior driver type a etc the extreme emotional need to control to lead and or to be the best or the most competent if they are also extroverted they are best described as field marshalls this trait is very valuable and essential in our society we need people who want to lead to strive to overcome the elements to seek and thirst for knowledge to raise the level of competency etc the great successes in science and technology are in large part due to the vision an n trait and scientifically minded approach t trait of the nt personality of course the other types and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well however when the nt person has self image challenges the dark side of this personality type usually comes out which should be obvious to all a physician who is a strong nt and who has not learned to temper their temperament will be extremely business like lack of empathy or feeling and is very compelled to have total control over their patient the patient must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question i ve known many m d s of this temperament and suffice to say i don t oblige them with a followup visit no matter how competent i think they are and they usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an extreme drive of theirs to know the most to know it all maybe we need more nf doctor s enough on this subject let s move on to candida bloom let me tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with it s environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics could it just be professional jealousy i couldn t help elaine or jon but somebody else did you ve helped me already by your post of course i believe that i have been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from anal retentivitis but being the phlegmatic i am maybe i was just a little too harsh on a few people myself in past posts let s all try to raise the level of this discussion above the level of anal effluent humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the gi system mouth stomach small and large intestine sinuses vagina and on the skin these are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised they are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body but any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body a poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin a is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier in my well described situation in prior posts i definitely was immune stressed blood tests showed my vitamin a levels were very low my sinuses were a mess no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged i also was on antibiotics times in years in the end even two weeks of ceftin did not work and i had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial infection of the sinuses via cat scans mucus color won t get into the details and other symptoms three very traditional ent s made this diagnosis i did not have any cultures done however because of the difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed a bacterial infection enough of this background provided to help you understand where i was when i make comments about my sporanox anti fungal therapy below the first question i have is this can fungus penetrate a little way into poor mucus membrane tissue maybe via hyphae thus causing symptoms without being considered systemic in the classic sense it is sort of an inbetween infection steve got real upset with elaine s doctor because he was using anti fungals and vitamin a for her gi problems if steve really understoood what vitamin a does in the body he would not or at least should not be calling elaine s doctor a quack i was concerned too because of the toxicity of vitamin a my doctor after my blood tests put me on iu of vitamin a for one week only then dropped it down to iu for the next couple of weeks i also received zinc and other supplementation since all of these interrelate in fairly complex ways as my doctor explained he s one of those evil orthomolecular specialists i had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin a was normal he then stopped me on all vitamin a except for some in a multi vitamin supplement and made sure that i maintain a iu day of beta carotene call me carrot face hopefully elaine s doctor will take a similar careful approach and to all supplements i m even reevaluating some supplements i m taking for example niacin in fairly large dosages gram day which steve dyer had good information about on sci med nutrition if niacin only has second order improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies then it probably is not worth taking such a large dose long term and risking liver damage survives if it gets access to a lot of glucose it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses gi tract or vagina in though i do now believe based on my successful therapy with sporanox that i definitely had some excessive growth of fungus unknown species in my sinuses i still want to ask the question have there been any studies that demonstrate candida blooms in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation sinusitis rhinitis my sinus irritation reduced significantly after one week of sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this time i did not have any noticeable gi track problems before starting on sporanox but some for a few days after which then went away considered normal btw my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books sorry can t remember which one and found an obscure comment dating back into the s which stated that people can develop contained non lethal or non serious aspergillis infestations aspergiliosis of the sinuses leading to sinus inflammation symptoms i ll have to dig out that reference again since it is relevant to this discussion some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isn t certain my doctor tested me i believe a rast or rast similar test for allergic response to specificially candida albicans and i showed a strong positive another question would everybody show the same strong positive so this test is essentially useless and assuming it is true that candida can grow part way into the mucus membrane tissue and the concentration exceeds a threshold amount could not a person who tests as having an allergy to candida definitely develop allergic symptoms such as mucus membrane irritation due to the body s allergic response as i said in an earlier post one does not need to be a rocket scientist or have a m d degree or a ph d in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis btw and i ll repost this again dr ivker in his book sinus survival has routinely given before anything else nizoral a pre sporanox systemic anti fungal not as safe and not as good as sporanox to his new chronic sinusitis patients if they have been on antibiotics four or more times in the last two years he claims that out of or so patients well over notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms but it doesn t cure it by any means implying the so called yeast fungus infection is not the primary cause but a later complication he s also found that nystatin whether taken internally or put into a sinus spray does not help this implies of course assuming that excessive yeast fungus bloom is aggravating the sinus inflammation that the yeast fungus has grown partway into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast fungus other than by direct contact it is not absorbed into the blood stream again i admit lots of ifs and implies which doesn t please the hard core nt who has to have the double blind study or it s a non issue but one has to start with some plausible hypothesis explanation a strawman if you will if it s internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondescript this brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny and reject any and all aspects of the yeast hypothesis until the appropriate studies are done and that is if you can t observe or culture the yeast bloom in the gut or sinus then there s no way to diagnose or even recognize the disease and i know they realize that it is virtually impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body it s a real catch another catch those who totally reject the yeast hypothesis say that no studies have been done actually studies have been done but if it s not up to a certain standard then it is from their perspective a non study which should not even be considered i agree that the appropriate studies should be done and that will take big to do it right however in order to convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets you literally have to give them evidence and the only acceptable evidence to compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study needed funding that is you have to do of the study before you even get funding as a scientist at a national lab i m very aware of this for the smaller funded projects i m afraid that even if dr ivker and other doctors got together pooled their practice s case histories and anecdotes into a compelling picture and approach the funding agencies they would get nowhere even if they were able to publish their statistical results it is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have decided excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to noticeable non lethal symptoms does not exist and is not even a tenable hypothesis so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence to the contrary will never change their mind and not only that they would also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it s a done issue excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not will not and cannot exist period kind of tough to dialog with those who hold such a viewpoint kind of reminds me of lister candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses the gi tract mouth stomach and intestines and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food the human immune system ususally does not bother itself with these nonpathogenic organisms unless they broach the mucus membrane barrier if they do an inflammatory response will be set up most americans are not getting enough vitamin a from their diets about of all american s die with less vitamin a than they were born with u s autopsy studies while this low level of vitamin a does not cause pathology blindness it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system this would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom aren t there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the sinus mucus membranes and cilia while diabetics can suffer from a candida bloom the most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned while drugs are available to handle candida many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection the toxicity of the anti fungal drugs does warrant some caution but if the gi or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candida and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun then anti fungal use should be approrpriate just as the anti fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections in spite of what mr steve dyer says again the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast fungus species can grow hyphae roots into deep tissue similar to mold growing in bread you can continue to kill the surface such as nystatin does but you can t kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic anti fungal such as itraconazole sporanox or some of the older ones such as nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective this is why as has been pointed out by recent studies sent to me by a doctor i ve been in e mail contact with thanks that nystatin is not effective in the long term treatment of gi tract candidiasis it s like trying to weed a garden by cutting off what s above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come out again once you walk away the question is whether a contained candida bloom can partially grow into tissue through the mucus membranes causing some types of symptoms in susceptible people e g allergy without becoming systemic in the classical sense of the word something in between strictly an excessive bloom not causing any problems and the full blown systemic infection that is potentially lethal in the gi system the ano rectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer through moisture and humidity of candida to the vaginal tract one of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear also if one is an anal retentive like i ve been diagnosed in a prior post that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth if the bloom occurs in the anal area the burning swelling pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids if the bloom manages to move further up the gi tract very diffuse symptomatology occurs abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool this positive stool for occult blood is what sent elaine to her family doctor in the first place after extensive testing he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt on to another doctor and so on richard kaplan has told me throiugh e mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positives candida blooms guys if my gut hurt me on a constant basis i would want it fixed yes it s nice to know that i don t have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress when i finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me better steve dyer calls him a quack as i ve said in private e mail there are flaws in our current medical system that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt alternative therapies after the approved proven accepted therapies don t work for example i went to three ent s who all said that i will just have to live with my acute chronic sinusitis after the ab s failed they did mention surgery to open up the ostia but my ostia weren t plugged and it would not get to the root cause of my condition after three months of aggressive and fairly non standard therapy sporanox body nutrient level monitoring and equalization vitamin c lentinen echinacea etc my health has vastly improved to where i was two years ago before my health greatly deteriorated of course skeptics would say that maybe if i did nothing i would have improved anyway but that view is stretching things quite far because of the experience of the three ent s i saw who said that i d just have to live with it i m confident i will reach what one could call a total cure the anti fungal program i undertook was one necessary step in that direction because of my overuse of ab s for the last four years note for those having sinus problems may i suggest the book by dr ivker i mention above be sure to get the revised edition i have often wondered what an m d with chronic gi distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a non existent syndrome dr ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems and his visits to several ent s totally floored him when they said you ll just have to live with it he spent several years trying everything standard and non standard until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis he now shares his approach in his book and i can honestly say that i am on the road to recovery following some parts of it his one recommendation to take a systemic anti fungal at the beginning of treatment if you have a history of anti biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own practice i m sure if i commented to him of the hard core beliefs of the anti yeast hypothesis posters that he would have definite things to say such as it s worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases to put it mildly i also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating their moral obligations to help the patient maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the hypothetical yeast overgrowth e g they fit some of the profiles the pro yeast people have identified should consider anti fungal therapy if all other avenues have been exhausted remember theory and practice are two different things you cannot have one without the other they are synergistic if a doctor does something non standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a thousand of his patients shouldn t you at least sit up and take notice maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works instead of why it shouldn t work i m afraid a lot of doctors have become so enamored with scientific correctness that they are ignoring the patients they have sworn to help you have to do both both have to be balanced which we don t see from some of the posters to this group there comes a point when you just have to use a little common sense and maybe an empirical approach such as trying a good systemic anti fungal such as sporanox after having exhausted all the other avenues i was one of those who the traditional medical establishment was not able to help so i did the natural thing i went to a couple of doctor s who are somewhat outside this establishment and as a result i have found significant relief would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up some kind of mechanism where any doctor without fear of being sued or having his license pulled can try experimental and unproven beyond a doubt therapies for his her patients that finally reach the point where all the accepted therapies are ineffective i d like to hear a doctor tell me well i ve tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this country and since they clearly don t work for you i now have the authority to use experimental unproven techniques that seem to have helped others i can t promise anything and there are some risks you will have to sign something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of these unproven therapies and i ll have to register your case at the state board anyway if my ent had suggested this to me i would ve jumped on this pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who for either altruistic reasons or for greed is practicing these alternative therapies with much risk to him her risk meaning losing their license and possibly to the patient such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free it also would be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the compassion of the medical community to the patient that it s doing everything it can within reason to help the patient it is the lack of such a mechanism that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies some of which seem to work like my case and others of which will never work at all true quackery i better get off my soapbox before this post reaches k in size if taken orally it can also become a major bacteria in the gut through aresol sprays it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes but before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened this is accomplished by vitamin a vitamin c and some of the b complex vitamins diet surveys repeatedly show that americans are not getting enough b and folate these are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this non existent disorder candida blooms after antibiotic therapy what dosage of b appears to be necessary to promote the healing and proper working of the mucos memebranes some of the above material was obtained from natural healing by mark bricklin published by rodale press as well as notes from my human nutrition course i will be posting a discussion of vitamin a sometime in the future along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin a plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin a should be effective in dealing with candida blooms another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase this is especially important if the gi system is involved if candida can not get glucose it s not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the gut i d like to see the role of complex carbohydrates such as starch if steve and some of the other nay sayers want to jump all over this post fine i jumped all over steve in sci med nutrition because he verbably accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor s use of vitamin a and anti fungals for a candida bloom in her gut people seeking advice from newsnet should not be treated this way those of us giving of our time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart s content if you saved your venom for me steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly seeking help alone i wouldn t have a problem with your behavior brave soul you are the venom on usenet can be quite toxic unless one develops an immunity

re is msg sensitivity superstition bruce data io com bruce reynolds writes anecedotal evidence is worthless even doctors who have been using a drug or treatment for years and who swear it is effective are often suprised at the results of clinical trials whether or not msg causes describable reportable documentable symptoms should be pretty simple to discover i tend to disagree i think anecdotal evidence provided there is a lot of it and it is fairly consistent will is very important first it points to the necessity of doing a study and second it at least says that the effects are all psychological or possibly allergy in this case as i ve pointed out before pyschological effects are no less real than other effects one person s make believe can easily be another person s reality using psychadelic drugs in a bizarre and twisted example the hallucinations one person experiences on an acid trip cannot be guaranteed to another person on an acid trip there is no clinical evidence that those effects are always going to happen anyhow that was a pretty lame example but hopefully i made my point it s all a matter of perception and as long as someone ingesting msg perceives it as causing bad effects then s he can definitely experience those affects on the other hand it could just be an allergy to the food it s in or something still anecdotal evidence is not worthless it s the stuff that leads to the study being done dan

re re help me inject from article apr vax oxford ac uk by krishnas vax oxford ac uk the best way of self injection is to use the right size needle and choose the correct spot for streptomycin usually given intra muscularly use a thin needle guage and select a spot on the upper outer thigh no major nerves or blood vessels there clean the area with antiseptic before injection and after make sure to inject deeply a different kind of pain is felt when the needle enters the muscle contrasted to the prick when it pierces the skin ps try to go to a doctor self treatment and self injection should be avoided as far as possible the areas that are least likely to hurt are where you have a little fat i inject on my legs and gut and prefer the gut i can stick it in at a degree angle and barely feel it i m not fat just have a little gut my legs however are muscular and i have to pinch to get anything and then i inject at about a degree angle and it still hurts the rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and muscular injections however so if it s a daily thing it would be best not to switch places every day to keep consistencey although some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot to prevent irritation when you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep wait for it to dry somewhat or you may get the alcohol in the puncture and of course that doesn t feel good a way to prevent irratation is to mark the spot that you injected a good way to do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the spot this helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot and spacing the sites out accuartely about apart this is from experience so i hope it ll help you i have diabetes and have to take an injection every morning later david david hahn university of wisconsin milwaukee hahn csd csd uwm edu

cholistasis sp fat free diet pregnancy hi i ve just returned from a visit with my ob gyn and i have a few concerns that maybe y all can help me with i ve been seeing her every weeks for the past few months i m at week and during the last visits i ve gained to pounds every weeks she said this was unacceptable over any week period as it stands i ve thus far gained pounds also she says that though i m at weeks the baby s size is weeks i think she mentioned inches for the top of the fundus when i was weeks the baby s size was weeks i must also add that i had an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and i ve had no problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain in my pelvic region during the pregnancy and i have a very difficult time moving and the doc has recommended i not walk or move unless i have to i have a little handicapped sticker for when i do need to go out anyway that s of the situation the other is that almost from the beginning of pregnancy i was getting sick throwing up about times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated i told her about this i know this because i wasn t eating very much due to the nausea and could see the results well now i only get sick about once every weeks and it is still bile related but in addition i had begun to feel movement near my upper right abdomen just below the right breast usually when i was lying on my right side it began to get worse though because it started to hurt when i lay on my right side and then it hurt no matter what position i was in next i noticed that when i ate greasy or fatty foods i felt like my entire abdomen had turned to stone and the pain in the area got worse however if i ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to cut the fat it wasn t as much of a problem so the doctor says i have cholistatis and that i should avoid fatty foods this makes sense and because i was already aware of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship i have been avoiding these foods on my own but i m still able to eat foods with ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods but doc wants me to be on a non fat diet this means no meat except fish and chicken w o skin i do this anyway no nuts fried food cheese etc i am allowed skim milk she said i should avoid anything sweet e g bananas also i must only have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day potatoes pasta rice she said i can t even cook vegetables in a little bit of oil and that i should eat vegetables raw or steamed i m concerned because i understand you need to have some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process and if i m not taking in fat is she expecting the baby will take it from my stores and why this restriction on carbohydrates if she s concerned about fat i m not clear how much of her recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on cholistatis which i can t seem to find any information on she originally said that i should only gain pounds during the entire pregnancy since i was about lbs overweight when i started but my sister gained lbs during her pregnancy and she s taken it all off and hasn t had any problems she also asked if any members of my family were obese which none of them are anyway i think she is overly concerned about weight gain and feel like i m being punished by a severe diet she did want to see me again in one week so i think she the diet may be temporary for that one week what i want to know is how reasonable is this non fat diet i would understand if she had said low fat diet since i m trying that anyway even if she said really low fat diet i think she assumes i must be eating a high fat diet but really it is that because of the endometriosis and the operation i m not able to use the energy from the food i do eat any opinions info and experiences will be appreciated i m truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few minutes and i ll end up having to eat constantly thus far i don t find any foods satisfying thanks g

how to prevent kidney stone formation i got asked in sci med nutrition about vitamin c and oxalate production toxic kidney stone formation i decided to post my answer here as well because of the recent question about kidney stones not long after i got into sci med i got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation i m going to state it again here but the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take b supplements read on to find out why i have my asbestos suit on now guys vitamin c will form oxalic acid but large doses are needed above grams per day review article nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney stones with particular emphasis on vitamin c int clin nutr rev but glycine also forms oxalic acid d amino acid oxidases for both glycine and vitamin c one of the best ways to drastically reduce this production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin c or glycine but to increase your intake of vitamin b control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in patients with kidney stones int urol nephrol to mg of b each day significasntly decreased the urinary excretion of oxalate over the month treatment program the action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria clin sci patients receiving at least mg b each day showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels for gylcine this effect is due to increased transaminase activity b is required for transaminase activity which makes less glycine available for oxidative deamination d amino acid oxidases for vitamin c the effect is quite different there are different pathways for vitamin c catabolism the pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have to of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid but this is highly variable and the vitamin c review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto grams per day not too much vitamin c gets catabolized to form oxalic acid at very high doses of vitamin c above grams per day more of the extra vitamin c more than conversion can end up as oxalic acid in a very early study on vitamin c and oxalic production proc soc exp biol med intakes of grams per day up to grams per day increased the average oxalic acid excretion from mg per day up to mg per day until grams per day was reached the average excreted was increased by only to mg per day gram dose gram dose gram dose and gram dose grams jumped it to mg over the average excretion before supplementation and grams jumped it to mg over the average before supplementation b is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body there are probably some enzymes that require vitamin b that we don t know about yet vitamin c catabolism is still not completely understood but the speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must have an enzyme in it that requires b differences in b levels could then explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin c challenge this is not the preferred route of catabolism increasing your intake of b would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you take vitamin c supplements since the typical american diet is deficient in b some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium oxalate kidney stones is b deficiency especially since so little oxalic acid gets absorbed from the gut diets providing to mg of oxalic acid per day showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate urol int if mg was present each day there was a significant increase in urinary oxalate excretion here are the high oxalate foods beans coca instant coffee parsley rhubarb spinach and tea contain at least mg grams beet tops carrots celery chocolate cumber grapefruit kale peanuts pepper sweet potatoe contain to mg grams if the threshold is mg per day you can see that you really have a lot of latitude in food selection a recent n eng j med article also points out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being absorbed at all if you also increase your intake of b you shouldn t have to worry about kidney stones at all the rda for b is mg per day for males and mg per day for females directly related to protein intake b can be toxic nerve damage if it is consumed in doses of mg or more per day for an extended peroid weeks to months the usda food survey done in had an average intake of mg per day for males and mg per day for females living in the u s coupled with this low intake was a high protein diet which greatly increases the b requirement as well as the presence of some of the different drugs that either block b absorption are metabolic antagonists of b or promote b excretion in the urine common ones are birth control pills alcohol isoniazid penicillamine and corticosteroids i tell my students to supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that increase the b requirement the dose recommended for patients taking birth control pills is mg per day and this should work for most of the other drugs that increase the b requirement this would be on top of your dietary intake of b any patient that has a history of kidney stone formation should be given b supplements one other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your ca mg dietary ratio is magnesium oxalate is much more soluble than is calcium oxalate the magnesium calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of patients with calcium oxalate calculi invest urol effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the crystallization of calcium in urine changes producted by food magnesium interaction j urol review article magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment of renal calcium stones j presse med there are actually about three times as many articles published in the medical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone formation than there are for b i thought that i was being pretty safe in stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier post in this news group but good old john a in mass jumped all over me i guess that he doesn t read the medical literature oh well since kidney stones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them i thought i d tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctor

re diet for crohn s ibd in article apr midway uchicago edu bmdelane quads uchicago edu brian manning delaney wrote one thing that i haven t seen in this thread is a discussion of the relation between ibd inflammation and the profile of ingested fatty acids fas i was diagnosed last may w crohn s of the terminal ileum when i got out of the hospital i read up on it a bit and came across several studies investigating the role of epa an essentially fa in reducing inflammation the evidence was mixed many of these studies are discussed in inflammatory bowel disease macdermott stenson but if i recall correctly there were some methodological bones to be picked with the studies both the ones w pos and w neg results in the studies patients were given epa a few grams day for most of the studies but if i recall correctly there was no restriction of the other fas that the patients could consume from the informed layperson s perspective this seems mistaken if lots of n fas are consumed along with the epa then the ratio of bad prostanoid products to good prostanoid products could still be fairly bad isn t this ratio the issue what s the view of the gastro community on epa these days epa supplements along with a fairly severe restriction of other fas appear to have helped me significantly though it could just be the low absolute amount of fat i eat calories brian bmdelane midway uchicago edu as you note the research is mixed so there is no consensus on the role of fatty acids in ulcerative colitis there is a role for short chain fatty acids in patients with colostomies and rectal pouches that are inflammed short is butyrate and shorter there may be a role for treatment of uc with short chain fatty acids and i am looking forward to the upcoming aga meeting in boston to see what people are doing you raise a hypothesis about the studies and restriction of other fatty acids you should contact the authors directly about that or even write a letter to the editor it is a good point by the way the abbreviation epa is not in general use so i do not know what fatty acid you are speaking about and to brian an u of c there is a physician named stephen hanauer there who is a recognized expert in the treatment of ibd you might give him a call he is interested in new combinations of drugs for the treatment of ibd if you call please say hello to him from me i was looking at u of c for a position and perhaps still am and be sure to look into joining the ccfa best of luck steve holland

quack quack was re candida yeast bloom fact or fiction in article rind enterprise bih harvard edu david rind writes do you believe that any quacks exist how about quack diagnoses is being a licensed physician enough to guarantee that someone is not a quack or is it just that even if a licensed physician is a quack other people shouldn t say so can you give an example of a commonly diagnosed ailment that you think is a quack diagnosis or have we gotten to the point in civilization where we no longer need to worry about unscrupulous healers taking advantage of people i would say there are also significant numbers of unscrupulous doctors of the squeaky clean traditional crew cut talk to the ama before starting any treatment kind who recommend treatments that though accepted may not be necessary for the patient at the time and all for making a quick buck i would not be surprised if the cost of medical services in the u s is significantly inflated by these quacks of a different color in fact i d say these doctors are the most dangerous since they call into question the true focus of the medical profession the ama and the boards should focus on these quacks instead of devoting unbelievable energy on search and destroy missions to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non traditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients that traditional accepted medicine cannot help now to make a general comment on many recent posts lately i ve seen the word quack bandied about recklessly when a doctor or doctor wanna be has decided to quit discussing any controversial medical subject in a civilized manner all he she has to do is say quack quack and somehow they magically expect the readership of this newsgroup to roll over on their backs and pee pee on themselves in obedience what do they teach you in medical school how to throw your authority around let me put it another way to make my point clear quack is a nebulous word lacking in any precision its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand the indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency and coming from any medical doctor or wanna be where competency is expected is real scary but what do i know i ve already been diagnosed by the sci med gods in this newsgroup as being anal retentive and psychotic i look forward to more net diagnoses hey they re free jon quacks r us noring p s may i suggest seriously that if the doctors and wanna be doctors on the net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments and theories such as the yeast theory should create your own moderated group you can call it sci med traditional moderated or sci med ama approved so you can keep anal retentives like me out of it charter member infj club if you re dying to know what infj means be brave e mail me i ll send info jon noring noring netcom com jkn international ip fred s gourmet chocolate carlton place phone chips world s best livermore ca v mail who are you read alt psychology personality that s where the action is

poisoning with heavy water was re too many mris in article apr informix com proberts informix com paul roberts writes in article apr kestrel edu king reasoning com dick king writes i recall reading somewhere during my youth in some science popularization book that whyle isotope changes don t normally affect chemistry a consumption of only heavy water would be fatal and that seeds watered only with heavy water do not sprout does anyone know about this i also heard this i always thought it might make a good eposide of columbo for someone to be poisoned with heavy water it wouldn t show up in any chemical test no one else seems to know so i ll post this this topic came up on sci physics fusion shortly after the cold fusion flap started as i recall its been done to some experimental mice they showed various ill effects and eventually died the reason is that deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as hydrogen due to its extra mass which causes lower velocity boltzman constant mumble this throws various bits of body biochemistry out of kilter and you get sick and die i ve never heard of anyone being poisened this way in or out of real life the process takes quite a while if anyone wants to write this book i would imagine you would have to replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy water wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium during this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and eventually die but i imagine it would take weeks during which the poisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the water the victim ingested was heavy you would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both alarmed and confused why should every organ in the body suddenly begin to deteriorate if you can figure out how the poisoner gets the heavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real story here come to think of it would continue even after the heavy water was no longer being ingested so hospitalisation might be too late the most detectable effect would be that the victim s body fluids would literally be heavy water has a molecular weight of and heavy water has a mw of thus the victim s weight will increase by about for every of body water replaced by heavy water maybe the detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that the victim s urine is strangely dense is there any medical test involving the specific gravity of a body fluid paul paul johnson paj gec mrc co uk tel ext these ideas and others like them can be had gec marconi research is not for each from any reputable idealist responsible for my opinions

this topic sparked by attempts to block the galileo and ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium thermal sources being dangerous numerous studies claim that even in worst case scenarios shuttle explosion during launch or accidental reentry at interplanetary velocities the risks are extremely small two interesting data points are the may loss of two snap b rtgs which landed intact in the pacific ocean after a nimbus b weather satellite failed to reach orbit the fuel was recovered after months with no release of plutonium in april the apollo lunar module reentered the atmosphere and its snap rtg heat source which was jettisoned fell intact into the feet deep tonga trench in the pacific ocean the corrosion resistant materials of the rtg are expected to prevent release of the fuel

made that chemicals released from the space shuttle s solid rocket boosters srbs are responsible for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer studies indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact both in absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources the remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted study charles jackman the atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups and was organized by dr michael prather nasa goddard institute for space studies the three groups involved michael prather and maria garcia nasa giss charlie jackman and anne douglass nasa goddard space flight center and malcolm ko and dak sze atmospheric and environmental research inc the effort was to look at the effects of the space shuttle and titan rockets on the stratosphere the following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine industrial sources kilograms year natural sources kilograms year shuttle sources kilograms year the shuttle source assumes space shuttles and titan rockets are launched yearly thus the launches would add less than to the total stratospheric chlorine sources the effect on ozone is minimal global yearly average total ozone would be decreased by this is much less than total ozone variability associated with volcanic activity and solar flares the influence of human made chlorine products on ozone is computed by atmospheric model calculations to be a decrease in globally averaged ozone between and the influence of the space shuttle and titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible the launch schedule of the space shuttle and titan rockets would need to be increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons do at the present time theoretical results of this study have been published in the space shuttle s impact on the stratosphere mj prather mm

eds report sam tr june usaf school of aerospace medicine brooks afb texas how the challenger astronauts died the challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion this is a well documented fact see the rogers commission report for example what looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank came apart the forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the astronauts never mind destroy their bodies according to the kerwin team s medical forensic report the astronauts were killed when the more or less intact cabin hit the water at circa mph and their bodies then spent several weeks underwater their remains were recovered and after the kerwin team examined them they were sent off to be buried using the shuttle beyond low earth orbit you can t use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low earth orbit because it can t get there it is big and heavy and does not carry enough fuel even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks furthermore it is not particularly sensible to do so because much of that weight is things like wings which are totally useless except in the immediate vicinity of the earth the shuttle orbiter is highly specialized for travel between earth s surface and low orbit taking it higher is enormously costly and wasteful a much better approach would be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high orbit

space faq how to become an astronaut archive name space astronaut last modified date how to become an astronaut first the short form authored by henry spencer then an official nasa announcement q how do i become an astronaut a we will assume you mean a nasa astronaut since it s probably impossible for a non russian to get into the cosmonaut corps paying passengers are not professional cosmonauts and the other nations have so few astronauts and fly even fewer that you re better off hoping to win a lottery becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast jet experience which means a military flying career forget that unless you want to do it anyway so you want to become a shuttle mission specialist if you aren t a us citizen become one that is a must after that the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly exceeds the supply nasa s problem is not finding qualified people but thinning the lineup down to manageable length it is not enough to be qualified you must avoid being dis qualified for any reason many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job get a ph d specialize in something that involves getting your hands dirty with equipment not just paper and pencil forget computer programming entirely it will be done from the ground for the fore seeable future degree s in one field plus work experience in another seems to be a frequent winner be in good physical condition with good eyesight do not get a radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision nobody knows what sudden pressure changes would do to rked eyes and long term effects are poorly understood for that matter avoid any other significant medical unknowns if you can pass a jet pilot physical you should be okay if you can t your chances are poor practise public speaking and be conservative and conformist in appearance and actions you ve got a tough selling job ahead trying to convince a cautious conservative selection committee that you are better than hundreds of other applicants and also that you will be a credit to nasa after you are hired public relations is a significant part of the job and nasa s image is very prim and proper the image you want is squeaky clean workaholic yuppie remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point and security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent keep your nose clean get a pilot s license and make flying your number one hobby experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non pilot jobs work for nasa of astronauts selected between and were military or nasa employees and the remaining two were a nasa consultant and mae jemison the first black female astronaut if you apply from outside nasa and miss but they offer you a job at nasa take it sometimes in the past this has meant you do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first think space they want highly motivated people so lose no chance to demonstrate motivation keep trying many astronauts didn t make it the first time nasa national aeronautics and space administration lyndon b johnson space center houston texas announcement for mission specialist and pilot astronaut candidates astronaut candidate program the national aeronautics and space administration nasa has a need for pilot astronaut candidates and mission specialist astronaut candidates to support the space shuttle program nasa is now accepting on a continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be considered all positions are located at the lyndon b johnson space center in houston texas and will involved a year training and evaluation program space shuttle program description the numerous successful flights of the space shuttle have demonstrated that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming routine the space shuttle orbiter is launched into and maneuvers in the earth orbit performing missions lastling up to days it then returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and flight crew the orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment and retrieval of satellites service of existing satellites operation of specialized laboratories astronomy earth sciences materials processing manufacturing and other operations these missions will eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space station the orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher orbits than can be achieved by the orbiter itself users of the space shuttle s capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include government agencies and private industries the crew normally consists of five people the commander the pilot and three mission specialists on occasion additional crew members are assigned the commander pilot and mission specialists are nasa astronauts pilot astronaut pilot astronauts server as both space shuttle commanders and pilots during flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle crew mission success and safety in flight the pilot assists the commander in controlling and operating the vehicle in addition the pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing the remote manipulator system in extra vehicular activities and other payload operations mission specialist astronaut mission specialist astronauts working with the commander and pilot have overall responsibility for the coordination of shuttle operations in the areas of crew activity planning consumables usage and experiment and payload operations mission specialists are required to have a detailed knowledge of shuttle systems as well as detailed knowledge of the operational characteristics mission requirements and objectives and supporting systems and equipment for each of the experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions mission specialists will perform extra vehicular activities payload handling using the remote manipulator system and perform or assist in specific experimental operations astronaut candidate program basic qualification requirements applicants must meet the following minimum requirements prior to submitting an application mission specialist astronaut candidate bachelor s degree from an accredited institution in engineering biological science physical science or mathematics degree must be followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible professional experience an advanced degree is desirable and may be substituted for part or all of the experience requirement master s degree year doctoral degree years quality of academic preparation is important ability to pass a nasa class ii space physical which is similar to a civilian or military class ii flight physical and includes the following specific standards distant visual acuity or better uncorrected correctable to each eye blood pressure measured in sitting position height between and inches pilot astronaut candidate bachelor s degree from an accredited institution in engineering biological science physical science or mathematics degree must be followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible professional experience an advanced degree is desirable quality of academic preparation is important at least hours pilot in command time in jet aircraft flight test experience highly desirable ability to pass a nasa class i space physical which is similar to a military or civilian class i flight physical and includes the following specific standards distant visual acuity or better uncorrected correctable to each eye blood pressure measured in sitting position height between and inches citizenship requirements applications for the astronaut candidate program must be citizens of the united states note on academic requirements applicants for the astronaut candidate program must meet the basic education requirements for nasa engineering and scientific positions specifically successful completion of standard professional curriculum in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor s degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering biological science physical science or mathematics the following degree fields while related to engineering and the sciences are not considered qualifying degrees in technology engineering technology aviation technology medical technology etc degrees in psychology except for clinical psychology physiological psychology or experimental psychology which are qualifying degrees in nursing degrees in social sciences geography anthropology archaeology etc degrees in aviation aviation management or similar fields application procedures civilian the application package may be obtained by writing to nasa johnson space center astronaut selection office attn ahx houston tx civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis when nasa decides to select additional astronaut candidates consideration will be given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is made applications received after that date will be retained and considered for the next selection applicants will be notified annually of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate continued interest in being considered for the program those applicants who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from consideration and their applications will not be retained after the preliminary screening of applications additional information may be requested for some applicants and person listed on the application as supervisors and references may be contacted active duty military active duty military personnel must submit applications to their respective military service and not directly to nasa application procedures will be disseminated by each service selection personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration once final selections have been made all applicants who were considered will be notified of the outcome of the process selection rosters established through this process may be used for the selection of additional candidates during a one year period following their establishment general program requirements selected applicants will be designated astronaut candidates and will be assigned to the astronaut office at the johnson space center houston texas the astronaut candidates will undergo a year training and evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to ongoing programs they will also participate in the basic astronaut training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight pilot astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in nasa aircraft during their candidate period applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does not insure selection as an astronaut final selection as an astronaut will depend on satisfactory completion of the year training and evaluation period civilian candidates who successfully complete the training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become permanent federal employees and will be expected to remain with nasa for a period of at least five years civilian candidates who are not selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within nasa depending upon agency requirements and manpower constraints at that time successful military candidates will be detailed to nasa for a specified tour of duty nasa has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates therefore qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply pay and benefits civilians salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the federal governments general schedule pay scales for grades gs through gs and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements and experience other benefits include vacation and sick leave a retirement plan and participation in group health and life insurance plans military selected military personnel will be detailed to the johnson space center but will remain in an active duty status for pay benefits leave and other similar military matters next faq orbital and planetary launch services

frequently asked questions that you would like included in this posting send email to leech cs unc edu jon leech if you don t want to see the faq add frequently asked questions to your kill file for this group if you re not reading this with a newsreader that can kill articles by subject you re out of luck the faq volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down by rewriting and condensing over time the faq postings are available in the ames space archive in faq faq good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here the point of this is to circulate existing information and avoid rehashing old answers better to build on top than start again nothing more depressing than rehashing old topics for the th time references are provided because they give more complete information than any short generalization questions fall into three basic types where do i find some information about space try your local public library first the net is not a good place to ask for general information ask individuals by email if you must there are other sources use them too the net is a place for open ended discussion i have an idea which would improve space flight hope

below may not apply to you in general however systems connected to the net fall in one of three categories internet usenet or bitnet electronic mail may be sent between these networks and other resources available on one of these networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to special servers the space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of several mechanisms with mostly transparent connections between them one mechanism is the mailing list in which mail is sent to a central distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list in addition to the general lists for space called space digest for internet users and space on bitnet there are a number of more specialized mailing lists described below a second mechanism is usenet netnews this is somewhat like a bulletin board operating on each system which is a part of the net netnews separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a group name the groups dealing most closely with space topics are called sci space news sci space sci space shuttle sci astro and talk politics space contributors post submissions called articles in netnews terminology on their local machine which sends it to other nearby machines similarly articles sent from nearby machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems so that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the usenet sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was posted gateway machines redirect the usenet sci space group into internet and bitnet mailing lists and vice versa the other usenet groups are not accessible as mailing lists if you can receive netnews its more flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually

material dealing with space and astronomy may be found on the net a few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access while the remainder support some form of file transfer many sites are listed as providing anonymous ftp this refers to the file transfer protocol on the internet sites not connected to the internet cannot use ftp directly but there are a few automated ftp servers which operates via email send mail containing only the word help to ftpmail decwrl dec com or bitftp pucc princeton edu and the servers will send you instructions on how to make requests the sources with the broadest selection of material are the nasa ames space archive and the national space science data center don t even ask for images to be posted to the net the data volume is huge and nobody wants

posting or the archived copy for the most up to date information on upcoming missions call info at kennedy space center official nasa shuttle status reports are posted to sci space news frequently why does the shuttle roll just after liftoff the following answer and translation are provided by ken jenks kjenks gothamcity jsc nasa gov the ascent guidance and flight control training manual asc g c says during the vertical rise phase the launch pad attitude is commanded until an i loaded v rel sufficient to assure launch tower clearance is achieved then the tilt maneuver roll program orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a negative q alpha which in turn alleviates structural loading other advantages with this attitude are performance gain decreased abort maneuver complexity improved s band look angles and crew view of the horizon the tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff meco target in second stage this really is a good answer but it s couched in nasa jargon i ll try to interpret we wait until the shuttle clears the tower before rolling then we roll the shuttle around so that the angle of attack between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere the relative wind and the chord of the wings the imaginary line between the leading edge and the trailing edge is a slightly negative angle a negative q alpha this causes a little bit of downward force toward the belly of the orbiter or the z direction and this force alleviates structural loading we have to be careful about those wings they re about the most delicate part of the vehicle the new attitude after the roll also allows us to carry more mass to orbit or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass or to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be the case if we didn t roll performance gain the new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort maneuvers the return to launch site decreased abort maneuver complexity the new attitude improves the ability for ground based radio antennae to have a good line of sight signal with the s band radio antennae on the orbiter improved s band look angles the new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon which is a helpful but not mandatory part of piloting any flying machine the new attitude orients the shuttle so that the body is more nearly parallel with the ground and the nose to the east usually this allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit remember velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction the shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit this all begs the question why isn t the launch pad oriented to give this nice attitude to begin with why does the shuttle need to roll to achieve that attitude the answer is that the pads were leftovers from the apollo days the shuttle straddles two flame trenches one for the solid rocket motor exhaust one for the space shuttle main engine exhaust you can see the effects of this on any daytime launch the srm exhaust is dirty gray garbage and the ssme exhaust is fluffy white steam watch for the difference between the top orbiter side and the bottom external tank side of the stack the access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented basically the same way they were for the saturn v s a side note the saturn v s also had a roll program don t ask me why i m a shuttle guy i checked with a buddy in ascent dynamics he added that the roll maneuver is really a maneuver in all three axes roll pitch and yaw the roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons stated the pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping the angle of attack q alpha within a tight tolerance the yaw component is used to determine the orbital inclination the total maneuver is really expressed as a quaternion a grad level math concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four element array how to receive the nasa tv

yoshiro yamada yamada yscvax ysc go jp us planetary missions mariner venus mars mercury flybys and orbiters mariner the first u s attempt to send a spacecraft to venus failed minutes after launch in the guidance instructions from the ground stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna so the onboard computer took control however there turned out to be a bug in the guidance software and the rocket promptly went off course so the range safety officer destroyed it although the bug is sometimes claimed to have been an incorrect fortran do statement it was actually a transcription error in which the bar indicating smoothing was omitted from the expression r dot bar sub n nth smoothed value of derivative of radius this error led the software to treat normal minor variations of velocity as if they were serious leading to incorrect compensation mariner became the first successful probe to flyby venus in december of and it returned information which confirmed that venus is a very hot degrees fahrenheit now revised to degrees f world with a cloud covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide sulfuric acid was later confirmed in mariner launched on november was lost when its protective shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary space unable to collect the sun s energy for power from its solar panels the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in solar orbit it was intended for a mars flyby with mariner mariner the sister probe to mariner did reach mars in and took the first close up images of the martian surface in all as it flew by the planet the probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere much thinner than previously thought many scientists concluded from this preliminary scan that mars was a dead world in both the geological and biological sense mariner was sent to venus in it reconfirmed the data on that planet collected five years earlier by mariner plus the information that venus atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least times that of earth s or the equivalent of being feet under the surface of an ocean mariner and were sent to mars in and expanded upon the work done by mariner four years earlier however they failed to take away the concept of mars as a dead planet first made from the basic measurements of mariner mariner ended up in the atlantic ocean in when the rocket launcher autopilot failed mariner the sister probe to mariner became the first craft to orbit mars in it returned information on the red planet that no other probe had done before revealing huge volcanoes on the martian surface as well as giant canyon systems and evidence that water once flowed across the planet the probe also took the first detailed closeup images of mars two small moons phobos and deimos mariner used venus as a gravity assist to mercury in the probe did return the first close up images of the venusian atmosphere in ultraviolet revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four earth days mariner eventually made three flybys of mercury from to before running out of attitude control gas the probe revealed mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than thought this would seem to indicate that mercury has an iron core which makes up percent of the entire planet pioneer moon sun venus jupiter and saturn flybys and orbiters pioneer through failed to meet their main objective to photograph the moon close up but they did reach far enough into space to provide new information on the area between earth and the moon including new data on the van allen radiation belts circling earth all three craft had failures with their rocket launchers pioneer was launched on october pioneer on november and pioneer on december pioneer was a moon probe which missed the moon and became the first u s spacecraft to orbit the sun in pioneer was originally designed to flyby venus but the mission was scaled down and it instead studied the interplanetary environment between venus and earth out to million kilometers in a record until mariner pioneer through were placed into solar orbit from to pioneer and are still transmitting information at this time pioneer e would have been number suffered a launch failure in pioneer became the first spacecraft to flyby jupiter in pioneer followed it in and then went on to become the first probe to study saturn in both vehicles should continue to function through and are heading off into interstellar space the first craft ever to do so pioneer venus also known as pioneer venus orbiter or pioneer burned up in the venusian atmosphere on october pvo made the first radar studies of the planet s surface via probe pioneer venus also known as pioneer sent four small probes into the atmosphere in december of the main spacecraft bus burned up high in the atmosphere while the four probes descended by parachute towards the surface though none were expected to survive to the surface the day probe did make it and transmitted for minutes on the ground before its batteries failed ranger lunar lander and impact missions ranger and were test probes for the ranger lunar impact series they were meant for high earth orbit testing in but rocket problems left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed ranger launched on january was intended to land an instrument capsule on the surface of the moon but problems during the launch caused the probe to miss the moon and head into solar orbit ranger did try to take some images of the moon as it flew by but the camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt ranger launched april had the same purpose as ranger but suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside the first u s probe to reach the moon albeit without returning data ranger launched october and similar to ranger and lost all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the moon and drifted off into solar orbit ranger through had more modified lunar missions they were to send back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact with the moon ranger failed this objective in when its cameras did not operate ranger through performed well becoming the first u s lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through lunar orbiter lunar surface photography lunar orbiter through were designed to orbit the moon and image various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned apollo missions of the probes also contributed greatly to our understanding of lunar surface features particularly the lunar farside all five probes of the series launched from to were essentially successful in their missions they were the first u s probes to orbit the moon all los were eventually crashed into the lunar surface to avoid interference with the manned apollo missions surveyor lunar soft landers the surveyor series were designed primarily to see if an apollo lunar module could land on the surface of the moon without sinking into the soil before this time it was feared by some that the moon was covered in great layers of dust which would not support a heavy landing vehicle surveyor was successful in proving that the lunar surface was strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from to only surveyor and were unsuccessful missions the rest became the first u s probes to soft land on the moon taking thousands of images and scooping the soil for analysis apollo landed feet from surveyor in and returned parts of the craft to earth surveyor the last of the series was a purely scientific mission which explored the tycho crater region in viking mars orbiters and landers viking was launched from cape canaveral florida on august on a titan e centaur d rocket the probe went into martian orbit on june and the lander set down on the western slopes of chryse planitia on july it soon began its programmed search for martian micro organisms there is still debate as to whether the probes found life there or not and sent back incredible color panoramas of its surroundings one thing scientists learned was that mars sky was pinkish in color not dark blue as they originally thought the sky is pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the thin atmosphere the lander set down among a field of red sand and boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image the viking orbiter kept functioning until august when it ran out of attitude control propellant the lander was switched into a weather reporting mode where it had been hoped it would keep functioning through but after november an errant command had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until further orders communication was never regained again despite the engineers efforts through may of an interesting side note viking s lander has been designated the thomas a mutch memorial station in honor of the late leader of the lander imaging team the national air and space museum in washington d c is entrusted with the safekeeping of the mutch station plaque until it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition viking was launched on september and arrived in martian orbit on august the lander touched down on september in utopia planitia it accomplished essentially the same tasks as its sister lander with the exception that its seisometer worked recording one marsquake the orbiter had a series of attitude control gas leaks in which prompted it being shut down that july the lander was shut down on april the orbits of both viking orbiters should decay around voyager outer planet flybys voyager was launched september and flew past jupiter on march and by saturn on november voyager was launched august before voyager and flew by jupiter on august by saturn on august by uranus on january and by neptune on august voyager took advantage of a rare once every years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to outer planet voyager could in principle have headed towards pluto but jpl opted for the sure thing of a titan close up between the two probes our knowledge of the giant planets their satellites and their rings has become immense voyager discovered that jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics lightning and aurorae three new satellites were discovered two of the major surprises were that jupiter has rings and that io has active sulfurous volcanoes with major effects on the jovian magnetosphere when the two probes reached saturn they discovered over ringlets and satellites including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep the rings stable the weather was tame compared with jupiter massive jet streams with minimal variance a year great white spot band cycle is known titan s atmosphere was smoggy mimas appearance was startling one massive impact crater gave it the death star appearance the big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings braids kinks and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain voyager thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts continued the mission to uranus and neptune uranus itself was highly monochromatic in appearance one oddity was that its magnetic axis was found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational axis giving uranus a peculiar magnetosphere icy channels were found on ariel and miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains satellites and one more ring were discovered in contrast to uranus neptune was found to have rather active weather including numerous cloud features the ring arcs turned out to be bright patches on one ring two other rings and other satellites were discovered neptune s magnetic axis was also skewed triton had a canteloupe appearance and geysers what s liquid at k the two voyagers are expected to last for about two more decades their on target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets beyond pluto their next major scientific discovery should be the location of the heliopause soviet planetary missions since there have been so many soviet probes to the moon venus and mars i will highlight only the primary missions soviet lunar probes luna lunar impact attempt in missed moon and became first craft in solar orbit luna first craft to impact on lunar surface in luna took first images of lunar farside in zond took first images of lunar farside in since luna was also a test for future mars missions luna first probe to soft land on the moon in returned images from surface luna first probe to orbit the moon in luna second successful soviet lunar soft landing mission in zond first successful circumlunar craft zond through accomplished similar missions through the probes were unmanned tests of a manned orbiting soyuz type lunar vehicle luna first probe to land on moon and return samples of lunar soil to earth in luna accomplished similar mission in luna delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the moon s surface lunokhod in a similar feat was accomplished with luna lunokhod in luna last soviet lunar mission to date returned soil samples in soviet venus probes venera first acknowledged attempt at venus mission transmissions lost enroute in venera attempt to image venus during flyby mission in tandem with venera probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in february of no images were returned venera attempt to place a lander capsule on venusian surface transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe became the first craft to impact on another planet in venera first probe to successfully return data while descending through venusian atmosphere crushed by air pressure before reaching surface in venera and mission profiles similar in venera first probe to return data from the surface of another planet in venera accomplished a more detailed mission in venera sent first image of venusian surface in was also the first probe to orbit venus venera accomplished similar mission venera returned first color images of venusian surface in venera accomplished similar mission venera accomplished radar mapping with venera of sections of planet s surface in more detailed than pvo vega accomplished with vega first balloon probes of venusian atmosphere in including two landers flyby buses went on to become first spacecraft to study comet halley close up in march of soviet mars probes mars first acknowledged mars probe in transmissions ceased enroute the following year zond first possible attempt to place a lander capsule on martian surface probe signals ceased enroute in mars first soviet mars probe to land albeit crash on martian surface orbiter section first soviet probe to circle the red planet in mars first successful soft landing on martian surface but lander signals ceased after seconds in mars attempt at orbiting mars in braking rockets failed to fire probe went on into solar orbit mars first fully successful soviet mars mission orbiting mars in returned images of martian surface comparable to u s probe mariner mars landing attempt in lander crashed into the surface mars lander missed mars completely in went into a solar orbit with its flyby bus phobos first attempt to land probes on surface of mars largest moon phobos probe failed enroute in due to human computer error phobos attempt to land probes on martian moon phobos the probe did enter mars orbit in early but signals ceased one week before scheduled phobos landing while there has been talk of soviet jupiter saturn and even interstellar probes within the next thirty years no major steps have yet been taken with these projects more intensive studies of the moon mars venus and various comets have been planned for the s and a mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been planned for how the many changes in the former soviet union now the commonwealth of independent states will affect the future of their space program remains to be seen japanese planetary missions sakigake ms t was launched from the kagoshima space center by isas on january and approached halley s comet within about million km on march the spacecraft is carrying three instru ments to measure interplanetary magnetic field plasma waves solar wind all of which work normally now so isas made an earth swingby by sakigake on january into an orbit similar to the earth s the closest approach was at h m s jst utc h on january the geocentric distance was km this is the first planet swingby for a japanese spacecraft during the approach sakigake observed the geotail some geotail passages will be scheduled in some years hence the second earth swingby will be on june at re earth s radius and the third october at re hiten a small lunar probe was launched into earth orbit on january the spacecraft was then known as muses a but was renamed to hiten once in orbit the lb probe looped out from earth and made its first lunary flyby on march where it dropped off its lb midget satellite hagoromo japan at this point became the third nation to orbit a satellite around the moon joining the unites states and ussr the smaller spacecraft hagoromo remained in orbit around the moon an apparently broken transistor radio caused the japanese space scientists to lose track of it hagoromo s rocket motor fired on schedule on march but the spacecraft s tracking transmitter failed immediately the rocket firing of hagoromo was optically confirmed using the schmidt camera cm f at the kiso observatory in japan hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and performed aerobraking experiments using the earth s atmosphere hiten made a close approach to the moon at jst utc h on february at the height of km from the moon s surface n e and fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into lunar orbit the following is the orbital calculation results after the approach apoapsis altitude about km periapsis

joint nasa esa project designed to accomplish an exploration of the saturnian system with its cassini saturn orbiter and huygens titan probe cassini is scheduled for launch aboard a titan iv centaur in october of after gravity assists of venus earth and jupiter in a vvejga trajectory the spacecraft will arrive at saturn in june of upon arrival the cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an orbit around saturn near the end of this initial orbit the huygens probe separates from the orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of titan the orbiter relays the probe data to earth for about hours while the probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the surface after the completion of the probe mission the orbiter continues touring the saturnian system for three and a half years titan synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about flybys of titan and targeted flybys of iapetus dione and enceladus the objectives of the mission are threefold conduct detailed studies of saturn s atmosphere rings and magnetosphere conduct close up studies of saturn s satellites and characterize titan s atmosphere and surface one of the most intriguing aspects of titan is the possibility that its surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere these hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain down onto the surface the cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to peer through titan s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the surface experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere the cassini mission is named for jean dominique cassini the first director of the paris observatory who discovered several of saturn s satellites and the major division in its rings the titan atmospheric entry probe is named for the dutch physicist christiaan huygens who discovered titan

translating commonly appearing acronyms in the space related newsgroups if i forgot or botched your favorite acronym please let me know also if there s an acronym not on this list that confuses you drop me a line and if i can figure it out i ll add it to the list note that this is intended to be a reference for frequently seen acronyms and is most emphatically not encyclopedic if i incorporated every acronym i ever saw i d soon run out of disk space the list will be posted at regular intervals every days all comments regarding it are welcome i m reachable as bradfrd ncar ucar edu note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for you re on your own for figuring out what they mean note also that the total number of acronyms in use far exceeds what i can list special purpose acronyms that are essentially always explained as they re introduced are omitted further some acronyms stand for more than one thing as of edition of the list these acronyms appear on multiple lines unless they re simply different ways of referring to the same thing thanks to everybody who s sent suggestions since the first version of the list and especially to garrett a wollman wollman griffin uvm edu who is maintaining an independent list somewhat more verbose in character than mine and to daniel fischer dfi specklec mpifr bonn mpg de who is maintaining a truly huge list at last count of acronyms

re nuclear waste in article rins ryukoku ac jp will rins ryukoku ac jp william reiken writes the real reason why accelerator breeders or incinerators are not being built is that there isn t any reason to do so natural uranium is still too cheap and geological disposal of actinides looks technically reasonable november december page science and technology in japan seawater uranium recovery experiment the ground uranium reserves are estimated at about million tons and it is anticipated that the demand and supply balance will collapse by the end of the th century in japan a resources poor country technological development are now under way to economically collect uranium dissolved in seawater the total quanity of uranium dissolved in seawater is estimated to be about billion tons a huge amount when compared with ground uranium reserves i hate to pour cold water on this but currently seawater extracted uranium even using the new improved fiber absorbers from japan is about times more expensive than uranium on the spot market uranium is very cheap right now around lb right now there are mines closing because they can t compete with places like cigar lake in canada where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards to the mines who work in shielded vehicles plenty of other sources for example uranium from phosphate processing would come on line before uranium reached lb demand and supply balance will collapse is nonsense supply and demand always balance what changes is the price is uranium going to increase in price by a factor of by the end of the century not bloody likely new nuclear reactors are not being built at a sufficient rate uranium from seawater is interesting but it s a long term project or a project that the japanese might justify on grounds of self sufficiency paul f dietz dietz cs rochester edu

re alaska pipeline and space station in article apr mksol dseg ti com mccall mksol dseg ti com fred j mccall writes i think this would be a great way to build it but unfortunately current spending rules don t permit it to be workable for this to work it would be necessary for the government to guarantee a certain minimum amount of business in order to sufficiently reduce the risk enough to make this attractive to a private firm since they generally can t allocate money except one year at a time the government can t provide such a tenant guarantee fred try reading a bit the government does lots of multi year contracts with penalty for cancellation clauses they just like to be damn sure they know what they are doing before they sign a multi year contract the reason they aren t cutting defense spending as much as they would like is the reagan administration signed enough multi year contracts that it s now cheaper to just finish them out look at ssf this years funding is billion of which will cover penalty clauses due to the re design pat

aerospace companies cooperate in reusable vehicle market what would all of you out there in net land think of the big martin mariatta boeing mcdonell douglas general dynamics lockheed rockwell getting together and forming a consortium to study exactly what the market price pints are for building reusable launch vehicles and spending say million to do that recognizing that most of the military requirements for launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere say has the shuttle ever really used that mi crossrange capability you get the idea figure out how many how often where to etc then taking this data and forming a sematech type company bad example i know but at least its an example to develop between and craft designs then to take all of those designs and figure out exactly what the technologies are and demonstrate those technologies in order to eliminate designs that can t be built today and lets say that this portion again funded by the gov cost about million and from here all of these companies went their separate ways with the intention of taking all of the market data and the design data to wall street and saying i want to build this vehicle and here are the numbers that show roi fund me now many of you think that this is a joke but i have it on good authority that just this project is shaping up in the background it seems that the aerospace companies have learned that everyone yelling similar but different things ends up in many programs that do nothing much and get canceled nasp nls als dcy etc they need to work more in the japaneese and european spirit of initial cooperation they have also learned that design requirements that are phony i e some generals idea of what a space vehicle ought to be ends up getting chopped up in congress because it is not a real requirement any feedback john
ssto senatorial aide breifing recollections the following are my thoughts on a meeting that i hugh kelso and bob lilly had with an aide of sen patty murrays we were there to discuss ssto and commercial space this is how it went after receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of ssto i called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local senator d patty murray washington state i started asking for an hour and when i heard the gasp on the end of the phone i quickly backed off to an hour later in that conversation i learned that a standard appointment is minutes we got the standard bozo treatment that is we were called back by an aide who scheduled a meeting with us in order to determine that we were not bozos and to familiarize himself with the material and to screen it to make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material well i got allocated hour with sen murrays aide and we ended up talking to him for minutes with us ending the meeting and him still listening we covered a lot of ground and only a little tiny bit was dcx specific most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer there was another woman there who took copius quantities of notes on every topic that we brought up but with murray being new we wanted to entrench ourselves as non corporate aligned i e not speaking for boeing local citizens interentested in space so we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to leo solar power satellites are a big focus here so we hit them as becoming feasible with lower cost access and we hit the environmental stand on that we hit the tourism angle and i left a copy of the patric collins tourism paper with side notes being that everyone who goes into space and sees the atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist esp after seeing the smog over l a we hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification which is more pronounced in space and said that that had potential to lead to understanding of and maybe a cure for osteoporosis we hit the education whereby kids get enthused by space but as they get older and find out that they havent a hop in hell of actually getting there they go on to other fields with low cost to orbit the chances they might get there someday would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed we hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business angle we hit the lower cost of satellite launches gps navigation personal communicators tellecommunications new services etc jobs provided in those sectors jobs provided building the thing balance of trade improvement etc we mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs we left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order to make this even easier to do and he asked questions on this point we ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are proceeding in this area and that we want to make sure that the results from these efforts are not lost much like condor or majellan and most importantly we asked that she help fund further efforts along the lines of lowering the cost to leo in the middle we also gave a little speal about the lunar resource data purchase act and the guy filed it separately he was very interested in it he asked some questions about it and seemed like he wanted to jump on it and contact some of the people involved with it so something may actually happen immediatly there the last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town and that they could feel free to call us any time with questions and if we didn t know the answers that we would see to it that they questions got to people who really did know the answers then finally we asked for an appointment with the senator herself he said that we would get on the list and he also said that knowing her this would be something that she would be very interested in although they do have a time problem getting her scheduled since she is only in the state week out of these days all in all we felt like we did a pretty good job john

washington post article on ssf redesign space station redesign leader says cost goal may be impossible today the washington post ran an article with the headline shown above the article starts with a leader of the nasa team in charge of redesigning the planned space station said yesterday the job is tough and may be impossible o connor is quoted saying whether it is possible to cut costs that much and still provide for meaningful research is a real question for me o connor said everything is fair game including dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the aerospace industry chopping management of the space station program at some nasa facilities around the country working closely with the russian space station mir and using unmanned titan rockets to supplement the manned space shuttle fleet o connor says his team has reviewed design options so far and they are sorting the serious candidates into three categories based on cost the post says o connor described the design derived from the current ssf as a high cost option i believe kathy sawyer the post writer got confused here i listened in on part of o connor s briefing to the press on monday and in one part of the briefing o connor talked about how the white house wants three options sorted by cost low medium and high in another part of the briefing he discussed the three teams he has formed to look at three options ssf derivative larc modular buildup with bus msfc and single launch core wingless orbiter jsc later in response to a reporters question i thought i heard o connor say the option based on a ssf redesign was a moderate cost option in between low high cost options not the high cost option as sawyer wrote the article goes on to describe the other two options as one features modules that could gradually be fitted together in orbit similar to the russian mir the other is a core facility that could be deposited in orbit in a single launch like skylab that option would use existing hardware from the space shuttle the fuselage for example in its basic structure the last sentence in the article contradicts the title the first paragraph the sentence reads he o connor said a streamlined version of the planned space station freedom is still possible within the administration s budget guidelines

nasa wraps in the april edition of one small step for a space activist allen sherzer tim kyger write another problem is what are called wraps or sometimes the center tax when work for a large program like freedom or shuttle is performed at a nasa center the center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts to a slush fund this money is used to fund work the center manager wants to fund this sum is estimated to be over a third of the funds allocated think about that of the billion cost of freedom fully billion won t be spent on anything having anything to do with space stations now maybe that billion was wisely spent and maybe it wasn t but the work done with it should stand on its own merits not distorting the cost of other projects congress has no idea of the existense of these wraps congress has never heard the term center tax they look at the station they are getting and the price they are paying and note that it doesn t add up they wonder this blissfully unaware that a third of the money is going for something else my dear friends your mixing fact and fiction here a couple of weeks ago when i first read this in your posting i talked with one of the cost experts here in space station at headquarters if you wondering why i didn t post a response immediately i do have a real job i m supposed to be doing here at headquarters digging up old khz data looking into sherzer kyger claims rates pretty low on the totem pole of priority also i spent last weekend in kansas city at the national science teachers association conference extolling the virtues of ssf to science teachers first off yes the concept of center tax or wrap does exist if i recall the numbers correctly the total tax for the ssf program for this fiscal year is around million this was computed by adding up the wp wp and wp center taxes with the ssf budget for this fiscal year at billion my calculater says the tax percentage is over the life of the ssf program using your figure of billion for the cost of ssf a tax at a rate comes to million this is alot less than billion but i will concede it s still an appreciable amount of pocket change i should note that your estimate of the tax rate at could be close to the actual rate the tax is only charged on funds that are spent at the center kind of like mcdonalds at some states where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat the food at the restaurant but you don t if you get it take out for example at wp the vast bulk of the funds we receive go to the rocketdyne contract and are not subject to the center tax i don t have the numbers in front of me but i d guess at least of the wp funds go to rocketdyne so you could be right about a tax rate of but it s only applied to funds spent at the center and not to the prime contracts this leads to the obvious question what is the government doing with ssf funds that don t go to the prime contractors i e ok wp gets a slice of the billion pie a big portion of this slice goes to rocketdyne what happens to the balance of the funds which aren t eaten up by the center tax at wp we call these funds we spend in house supporting development funds as they are supporting the development work done by rocketdyne we have used these funds to setup our own testbed to checkout the electrical power system architecture our testbed has a real life solar array field left over from solar cell research research a few years back with lead acid car batteries to simulate the nickel hydrogen batteries on ssf dc switchgear dc dc converter units and simulated loads data from the testbed was used in a recent change evaluation involving concerns about the stability of the power system we have also used the supporting development money to purchase nickel hydrogen batteries which are on life testing at both lewis and the crane naval facility in indiana as a side point of the battery cells on test recently hit the four year life test milestone cells have completed to cycles the on orbit batteries go through cycles per year as a final example my home division at lewis used the supporting development funds to purchase personal computers and work stations for performing system analyses like modeling of the performance of the electrical power system availability calculations using a monte carlo simulation setting up a database with information on weight of the power system elements finally the money raised by the tax does not all go into a slush fund at lewis the director does control a small discretionary fund each year any individual at lewis can submit a proposal to the director to get money from this fund to look at pretty much anything within the lewis charter most of the tax however goes to fund the general services at the center like the library the central computer services division the contractor who removes the snow etc thus it is rather difficult to determine what percentage of the ssf budget doesn t go for ssf activities to get an accurate figure you would have to take the annual expenditure for the library for example and then divide by the amount of the library funds used to support ssf which would be hard to compute by itself how would you figure out what percentage of the bill for aviation week for year is billable to ssf would you base it on the person hours ssf employees spend reading av week versus the rest of the center personnel you would then have to compare this estimate of the ssf portion of the library expense with the portion of the tax that goes to support the library who knows maybe ssf overpays on the tax to run the library but we underpay for snow removal talk about a burecratic nightmare my last point is that i can t believe your claim that congress has never heard of the term center tax unfortunately all of the nasa testimony before congress isn t on a computer so i can t do a simple word search someplace to prove you wrong but surely in some gao audit somewhere these nasa cost methods were documented for congress
dc x rollout report mcdonnell douglas rolls out dc x huntington beach calif on a picture perfect southern california day mcdonnell douglas rolled out its dc x rocket ship last saturday the company hopes this single stage rocket technology demonstrator will be the first step towards a single stage to orbit ssto rocket ship the white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the white sands missile range in new mexico this week flight tests will start in mid june although there wasn t a cloud in the noonday sky the forecast for ssto research remains cloudy the sdi organization which paid million for the dc x can t itself afford to fund full development of a follow on vehicle to get the necessary hundreds of millions required for a sub orbital dc xa sdio is passing a tin cup among its sister government agencies sdio originally funded ssto research as a way to cut the costs for orbital deployments of space based sensors and weapns however recent changes in sdi s political marching orders and budget cuts have made ssto less of a priority today the agency is more interested in using dc x as a step towards a low cost reusable sounding rocket sdio has already done briefings to other government agencies said col simon pete worden sdio s deputy for technology but worden declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the program i didn t make colonel by telling my contractors how much money i have available to spend he quipped at a press conference at mcdonnell douglas astronautics headquarters while sdio has lowered its sights on the program s orbital objective agency officials hail the dc x as an example of the better faster cheaper approach to hardware development the agency believes this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that leapfrog ahead of evolutionary technology developments worden said the dc x illustrates how a build a little test a little approach can produce results on time and within budget he said the program which went from concept to hardware in around months showed how today s engineers could move beyond the miracles of our parents time the key is management worden said sdio had a very light hand on this project we had only one overworked major jess sponable although the next phase may involve more agencies worden said lean management and a sense of government industry partnership will be crucial it s essential we do not end up with a large management structure where the price goes up exponentially sdio s approach also won praise from two california members of the house science space and technology committee this is the direction we re going to have to go said rep george brown the committee s democratic chairman programs that stretch aout to years aren t sustainable nasa hasn t learned it yet sdio has rep dana rohrbacher brown s republican colleague went further joking that a shrimp is a fish designed by a nasa design team rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it were left to the civil space agency rohrbacher whose orange county district includes mcdonnell douglas also criticized nasa air force work on conventional multi staged rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology let s not build fancy ammunition with capsules on top let s build a spaceship although rohrbacher praised sdio s sponsorship he said the private sector needs to take the lead in developing ssto technology mcdonnell douglas which faces very uncertain prospects with its c transport and space station freedom programs were more cautious about a large private secotro commitment on very large ventures companies put in seed money said charles ordahl mcdonnell douglas senior vice president for space systems you need strong government investments while the government and industry continue to differ on funding for the dc xa they agree on continuing an incremental approach to development citing corporate history they liken the process to douglas aircraft s dc aircraft just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for the dc transport a gradual evolution in single stage rocketry could eventually lead to an orbital delta clipper dc flight tests this summer at white sands will expand the envelope of performance with successive tests increasing speed and altitude the first tests will reach feet and demonstrate hovering verticle take off and landing the second series will send the unmanned dc x up to feet the third and final series will take the craft up to feet maneuvers will become more complex on third phase the final tests will include a pitch over manever that rotates the vehicle back into a bottom down configuration for a soft four legged landing the flight test series will be supervised by charles pete conrad who performed similar maneuvers on the apollo moon landing now a mcdonnell douglas vice president conrad paised the vehicles aircraft like approach to operations features include automated check out and access panels for easy maintainance if the program moves to the next stage engine technology will become a key consideration this engine would have more thrust than the pratt whitney rl a engines used on the dc x each motor uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to pounds of thrust based on the engine used in centaur upper stages the a model has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three to on throttling capability it also is designed for repeat firings and rapid turnaround worden said future single stage rockets could employ tri propellant engine technology developed in the former soviet union the resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes the mechanism for the teaming may already be in place pratt has a technology agreement with npo energomash the design bureau responsible for the tri propellant and energia cryogenic engines

fred and tom ad naseum nick sez i m not very impressed by the old so called prospecting work from lpi it has almost all been geared towards industrially silly processes on the moon as an excuse to put astronauts there fred replies translation it doesn t support the nick szabo vision of the future to which you must subscribe tom sez fred we re all supporting what each of us thinks should be done to some degree if you have a problem with what nick thinks should be done address it instead of just complaining about his doing so fred again you really don t get what the complaints are about do you not incredibly clear explanation of complaints something between feelings regarding nick s method and judgments about his meaning t maybe i d get it if you said what the complaints are about rather than doing the same things that you mean to complain about when you trash people how am i supposed to read that as trashing people is bad f gee funny that you get it now then deliberate obtuseness perhaps fred s issue nick s alleged trashing of others i only got it when you stopped trashing and made your point patently instead of allegorically that was my point all along fred not only do you do the same thing on the net honestly reporting your ideas on matters of policy and projects in space but your response was just baiting not even part of a debate i have yet to see nick enter into anything remotely resembling a debate i see him flame anyone or anything who disagrees with the one true szabo plan i see him attacking people calling them lazy bastard because they had the temerity to disagree with the almight nick i see him questioning peoples ethics again because they had the temerity to disagree with lord god szabo but debate bwaaaaahhhaaaa i m glad you can laugh since your ratio of debate insult is about the same not even close tommy and generally only when i m dealing with someone like nick i see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations not least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is and is not debate suffice to say that i disagree with you on that last point why don t you take a poll fred if you want some psuedo objective point of view and as usual you defend your insults with he started it yeah i took some of his research and called it my own but he started it so what if i stole his car he stole my lawnmower first besides that i think it s still open to interpretation whether nick actually did start it so your defense besides being lame and contradicting the first part of the sentence in which it occurs may not even apply anyway your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool i never borrowed it i already gave it back and it was broken when you gave it to me make up yer mind fred i m not convinced that people are necessary in all parts of every space based process and your response doesn t tell me a thing about the reasons why you think they should be except to impune the motives of the person with a divergent opinion who said i think they should be tommy show me a note where i said that and i ll eat this terminal see below fred fred i cocluded that you did since you took issue with it the fact that my conclusion was incorrect i e that you were taking issue with something different is evidence that your communication style is confusing or evidence that your reading and comprehension style are inadequate first i try to address what i think you meant for which i am rewarded with a denial of sorts and a smart remark then i point out that i am not clear what you did mean rather than risking your childish ire wrongly interpreting you a second time and i m stupid for it i just can t win can i fred you ve got a great point here somewhere it s just that between stupid people that you must insult and your jealous guarding of your valuable opinions you never actually get around to making it please quote the it i took issue with i believe you will see if you look that what i was and am taking issue with is mr szabo s idea that the manned program should be scrapped until such time as his toaster based infrastructure is finished all hail the szabo plan fred issue nick s alleged meaning too bad the plan only exists in your mind instead of nick s or you would have a really good point instead you have provided a good reason to ignore your insults since they are based on incorrect interpretations that you have made about others forgive me for giving your insults more meaning than they ever should have had my reading of what nick actually said is that people aren t required in all parts of all space processes so your taking issue with his opinions regarding people in the space program i read as people are required in all parts of all space processes so help me out here fred since i m so patently stupid did you read nick wrong or are you going to eat your terminal now if the latter i sure hope it s one of those cheeto and string models that all the computer mags have been raving about the point is i am not stupid because of your incorrect assumption i d only be stupid if i insulted you for having made it but alas that s your job fred and finally your style is confusing since you tried to make two points simultaneously with an allegory insult sadly one point addressed a plan that only existed in your mind and the other took issue with behaviors that you do as much as anyone more deliberate lack of understanding tommy no no i finally got it you don t like the plan that nick s posts made you imagine and you don t like nick s obnoxious behavior even though it s no worse than your own thanks for taking the time with someone as dense as myself if you have a problem with nick s delivery address that the way you bait you re perpetuating the lack of discourse that you complain of no tommy the bait is that which elicits the response nick baits i just flame him for being an obnoxious fool i don t really care who started it i read this list to get information and other s views on the issues to which it was dedicated not to be your mom he started it no he did or to hear about why nick is a very bad guy if you think flaming is bad stop flaming or at least get to the point in the first post instead of explaining yourself all the time that s nice tommy when you pay me to post to the net you can complain about not getting your money s worth perhaps if you weren t deliberately too thick to get the point the first time i wouldn t have to waste time explaining myself all the time of course socrates how could it be otherwise i think it s neat how all this criticism from you started after your fatherly admonitions to me about how such things should be handled outside usenet were somewhat rebuffed being a little hypocritical tommy to go with the immaturity or is this just the pique of a net ghod wannabe who got turned down by someone he thought was new and hence could be instructed tommy i saw you come on the net who cares who came on the net first if you do consider that you saw me come on after a brief haitus before which i was on for about years if you had seen me on the net first you d remember when nick and i went down exactly the same road regarding rude unneccesary behavior it s just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that s no worse than your own let s see here my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn t and my complaints about your name calling are immature while your name calling isn t yeah right maybe if you called me some more names i might see it better fred net ghod wannabe naturally fred you ve correctly interpreted my motivations when yours are impossible to judge from your actions as your insulting of people that try proves i didn t really care about people that fill the net with personal garbage what i really wanted was to impress everyone i only put my complaints with your behavior on private mail not because it belongs there but because i thought you were such a jerk that you d bring it back to the net playing right into my hands alas i had no idea what an intellectual master you were turning tables and bringing the history of these posts to the net for the noble and valuable purpose of embarassing me whether i should feel stupid because i tried to make suggestions to such a superior intellect or becuase i tried to communicate like an adult with a self righteous ass still isn t clear well fred you exposed me now i ll never be able to get a nother job with nasa since they all know that i m stupider than fred mccall well i just hope you re happy please leave me alone now i just don t have the heart to attempt keeping up with one so far above me

re big amateur rockets let s see these aren t in a strict sense amateur rockets that term denotes rockets the engines of which are constructed by the user the rockets you describe are called hpr or high power rockets to distinguish them from smaller model rockets they use factory made ammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engines with graphite nozzles the engines are classified by impulse a d engine for example can have no more than newton seconds of impulse an f engine can have no more than ns each letter corresponds to a doubling of the maximum impulse so far engines up to size o are available pretty much off the shelf engines of size h and above are shipped as class b explosives and as such are controlled engines of size f and below are shipped as class c explosives and are not as controlled class f engines btw are not hpr engines but model rocket engines class g engines go in and out of legal limbo there is an hpr society the tripoli rocket society i believe which holds events at various sites throughout the year with all legalities faa waiver included taken care of the national association of rocketry is more concerned with engines below h though it is involved in hpr as well these societies certify users of hpr rockets and companies will not sell to uncertified individuals bottom line it s legit i suggest you send for a catalog but forget the dynamite will ya larry c

orion drive in vacuum how background the orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept it would be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft the idea was that you d detonate devices with somewhere from one to ten megatons yield behind a pusher plate attached to the main spacecraft the shock wave from the explosions would transfer momentum to the ship now in an atmosphere i can see this the energy of the explosion heats the atmosphere which expands explosively and slams a shock wave into the pusher plate but in a vacuum only two things i can see are going to hit the plate fission fusion products barium krypton helium neutrons evaporated bomb casing and electromagnetic radiation gammas mostly some light heat from irradiated fission products would this work i can t see the em radiation impelling very much momentum especially given the mass of the pusher plate and it seems to me you re going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once they re there i must be missing something would someone enlighten me via email thanks jim jim goltz alternet engineer goltz uunet uu net

re japanese moon landing there is no such thing as a stable lunar orbit is it right that is new stuff for me so it means that you just can not put a sattellite around around the moon for too long because its orbit will be unstable if so what is the reason is that because the combined gravitacional atraction of the sun moon and earth that does not provide a stable orbit around the moon c o egalon larc nasa gov c o egalon larc nasa gov claudio oliveira egalon

japanese moon landing temporary orbit rls uihepa hep uiuc edu ray swartz oh that guy again writes the gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit fuzzy regions these are described by the inventor as exploiting the second order perturbations in a three body system the probe was launched into this region for the earth moon sun system where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow down the idea is that natural objects sometimes get captured without expending fuel we ll just find the trajectory that makes it possible the originator of the technique said that nasa wasn t interested but that japan was because their probe was small and couldn t hold a lot of fuel for deceleration i should probably re post this with another title so that the guys on the other thread would see that this is a practical use of temporary orbits another possible temporary orbit phil fraering seems like every day we find out all sorts of stuff pgf srl cacs usl edu like how the ancient mayans had televison repo man

re guns for space in reference to the limits of acceleration with guns launching solid rockets as payloads thiokol provided me with samples and data on a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations solid motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of aluminum in the mix for example the space shuttle srbs are percent aluminum the technique is to use a foamed aluminum structure the structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles an i suspect some bubbling process is used to form it in other words if you made a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum then froze it this is what you get it forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in all directions the remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into the voids and you get aluminum reinforced solid propellant the foamed aluminum makes up about percent of the total propellant so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain the major improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking which is the principal failure mode for solid propellant dani eder dani eder meridian investment company w h rt box athens al location deg n deg w m alt
re guns for space okay lets get the record straight on the livermore gas gun the project manager is dr john hunter and he works for the laser group at livermore what you may ask does gas guns have to do with lasers nothing really but the gun is physically located across the road from the free electron laser building and the fel building has a heavily shielded control room thick walls from which the gun firings are controlled so i suspect that the office he works for is an administrative convenience i visited hunter at the beginning of feb and we toured the gun at the time i was working on gas gun r d at boeing where i work but i am now doing other things helping to save the space station the gun uses a methane air mixture which is burned in a chamber about ft long by inch id i e it looks like a pipe the chamber holds a ton piston which is propelled at several hundred m s down the chamber on the other side of the piston is hudrogen gas initially at room temperature andsome tens of atmospheres the piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures at around psi the barrel of the gun is about feet long and has a inch bore it is mounted at right angles to the chamber i e they intersect this was done so that in the future the barrel could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to move the larger and heavier chamber the projectile being used in testing is a kg cylinder of lexan plastic in in diameter and about cm long all of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen gas from psi downwards until the projectile leaves the barrel the barrel is evacuated and the end is sealed with a sheet of plastic film a little thicker than saran wrap the plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped in the barrel ahead of the projectile the gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic water jugs in the early testing fragments of the plastic projectile were found at the higher speeds in later testing the projectile vaporizes the testing is into a bunker because the livermore test range is about miles across and the projectile would go km if fired for maximum range the intent is to move the whole gun to vandenberg afb after the testing is complete where they can fire into the pacific ocean and use the tracking radar at vafb to follow the projectiles the design goal of the gun is to throw a kg projectile at km s half of orbital speed so far they have reached km s and the gun is currently down for repairs as on the last test they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware i think it had to do with the methane air more detonating than burning but i haven t had a chance to talk to hunter directly on this there are people waiting to test scramjet components in this gun by firing then out of the gun into the air at mach km s since the most you can get in wind tunnels is mach this gun cost about million to develop and is basically a proof of concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful sized payloads into space this would require on the order of kg projectiles which deliver on the order of kg useful payload to orbit dani eder dani eder meridian investment company w h rt box athens al location deg n deg w m alt
re elevator to the top floor reading from a amoco performance products data sheet their erl resin with t carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive strength of psi it has a density of lb cu in therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column that can just support itself is million inches or ft or statute miles now a real structure will have horizontal bracing either a truss type or guy wires or both and will be used below the crush strength let us assume that we will operate at of the theoretical strength this gives a working height of miles for a constant section column a constant section column is not the limit on how high you can build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section as you go up for example let us say you have a pound load to support at the top of the tower for simplicity in calculation this requires square inches of column cross sectional area to support the weight the mile of structure below the payload will itself weigh lb so at mile below the payload the total load is now lb a increase the next mile of structure must be thicker in cross section to support the top mile of tower plus the payload each mile of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way to the bottom we can see from this that there is no theoretical limit on area although there will be practical limits based on how much composites we can afford to by at lb and how much load you need to support on the ground for which you need a foundation that the bedrock can support let us arbitrarily choose billion as the limit in costruction cost with this we can afford perhaps lb of composites assuming our finished structure costs lb the lb figure is just for materials cost then we have a tower payload mass ratio of at a mass ratio per mile the tower height becomes miles this is clearly above the significant atmosphere a rocket launched from the top of the tower will still have to provide orbital velocity but atmospheric drag and g losses will be almost eliminated g losses are the component of rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity thus they represent wasted thrust together with drag rockets starting from the ground have a velocity penalty to contend with this analysis is simplified in that it does not consider wind loads these will require more structural support over the first miles of height above that the air pressure drops to a low enough value for it not to be a big factor dani eder dani eder meridian investment company w h rt box athens al location deg n deg w m alt
end of the space age there is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today s la times thursday april p d i thought i d post it to stir up some flame wars i mean reasoned debate let me preface it by saying that i largely agree that the space age in the romantic sense of several decades ago is over and that projects like the space station miss the point at this time reading for example what s new the weekly physics update we get here on the net it s clear that the romance of the day lies in the ever more fine grained manipulation of matter by which i include biotechnology condensed matter physics with its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere and the amazing things people are doing with individual atoms these days to a large extent i think the romance some people still have with space is a matter of nostalgia i feel sure that someday we or more precisely our mind children will spread across space unless we wipe ourselves out but i think that manned space exploration is not what is exciting about what we can do now anyway let me quote some of this article but not all space age glory fades from view micheal schrage writer consultant and research associate at mit at america s space age won t have to suffer through the angst of a midlife crisis the reason is that the space age is already dead the technologies no longer define our times and the public has grown weary of the multibillion dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic rewards space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of america s science and technology debate into a peripheral issue speace is not a meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate our technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion policy to be sure america should continue to invest in satellite technologies for telecommunications and remote sensing cheap deep space probes would be nice too but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of scientific and industrial innovation is now dead before the change in administrations it would have been foolish to write an obituary for the space age the bush white house aggressively supported the space program and proposed spending well over billion to build space station freedom alone even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains office of management and budget director richard darman was an outspoken public champion of big ticket space expenditures the reality that much of the civilian space program from the shuttle to the hubble telescope to the space station was poorly conceived and unimpressively implemented did not seem to matter much political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism not a coherent vision or cost effective sensibilities determined multibillion dollar space budgets indeed with few notable exceptions such as voyager the post apollo era is the story of the gold plated porkification of space exploration with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more while the clinton administration has kept on the highly regarded daniel goldin as administrator of the national aeronautics and space administration it seems clear that space exploration is not being positioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of america s technological prowess the space station budget has rightly been slashed space is virtually ignored when the administration champions its competitiveness agenda i wish this had happened years ago instead of starting to happen now says bruce murray a caltech professor who ran nasa s jet propulsion lab in pasadena we ve put off a lot of things we shouldn t have i would rather see a billion nasa doing well than a billion one filled with white elephants

re orbital repairstation the difficulties of a high isp otv include long transfer times radiation damage from vanallen belts for both the spacecraft and otv arcjets or xenon thrusters require huge amounts of power so you have to have either nuclear power source messy dangerous and source of radiation damage or big solar arrays sensitive to radiation or heavy that make attitude control and docking a big pain if you go solar you have to replace the arrays every trip with current technology nuclear power sources are strongly restricted by international treaty refueling even for very high isp like xenon is still required and turn out to be a pain you either have to develop autonomous rendezvous or long range teleoperation to do docking or and refueling you still can t do much plane change because the deltav required is so high the air force continues to look at doing things this way though i suppose they are biding their time till the technology becomes available and the problems get solved not impossible in principle but hard to do and marginally cheaper than one shot rockets at least today just a few random thoughts on high isp otv s i designed one once steve collins

re what if the ussr had reached the moon first in article saundrsg qucdn queensu ca graydon saundrsg qucdn queensu ca writes this is turning into what s a moonbase good for and i ought not to post when i ve a hundred some odd posts to go but i would think that the real reason to have a moon base is economic since someone with space industry will presumeably have a much larger gnp than they would without space industry eventually they will simply be able to afford more stuff if i read you right you re saying in essence that with a larger economy nations will have more discretionary funds to waste on a lunar facility that was certainly partially the case with apollo but real lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military scientific or commercial reason for being rather than just a we have the money why not approach it s conceivable that luna will have a military purpose it s possible that luna will have a commercial purpose but it s most likely that luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred years at least therefore lunar bases should be predicated on funding levels little different from those found for antarctic bases can you put a person base on the moon for million a year even if you use grad students gary gary coffman ke zv you make it gatech wa mei ke zv gary destructive testing systems we break it uunet rsiatl ke zv gary shannon way guaranteed emory kd nc ke zv gary lawrenceville ga

diaspar virtual reality network announcement posted to the internet by wmiler nyx cs du edu david the lunar tele operation model one ltm by david h mitchell march introduction in order to increase public interest in space based and lunar operations a real miniature lunar like environment is being constructed on which to test tele operated models these models are remotely controlled by individuals located world wide using their personal computers for edutainment purposes not only does this provide a test bed for simple tele operation and tele presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of information on methods of operating in space including but not limited to layout of a lunar colony tele operating machines for work and play disseminating educational information providing contests and awards for creativity and achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in twenty first century remote learning methods because of the nature of the ltm project people of all ages interests and skills can contribute scenery and murals models and structures interfacing and electronics software and graphics in operation ltm is an evolving playground and laboratory that can be used by children students and professionals worldwide using a personal computer at home or a terminal at a participating institution a user is able to tele operate real models at the ltm base for experimental or recreational purposes because a real facility exists ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the construction of the lunar model its operation and new features to be added as suggested by the users themselves this has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups tele operations and virtual reality research radio control model railroad and ham radio operation astronomy and space planetariums and science centers art and theater bbs and online network users software and game developers manufacturers and retailers of model rockets cars and trains children the child in all of us ltm overall design a room feet by feet contains the base lunar layout the walls are used for murals of distant moon mountains star fields and a view of the earth the floor is the simulated lunar surface a global call for contributions is hereby made for material for the lunar surface and for the design and creation of scale models of lunar colony elements scenery and machine lets the ltm initial design has tele operated machinelets an ssto scale model which will be able to lift off hover and land a bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area and a moon train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface each machinelet has a small tv camera utilizing a ccd tv chip mounted on it a personal computer digitizes the image including reducing picture content and doing data compression to allow for minimal images to be sent to the operator for control purposes and also return control signals the first machinelet to be set up will be the moon train since model trains with tv cameras built in are almost off the shelf items and control electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal the user will receive an image once every to seconds depending on the speed of their data link to ltm next an ssto scale model with a ccd tv chip will be suspended from a servo motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the ssto to be controlled by the operator to take off hover over the entire lunar landscape and land finally some tank models will be modified to be ccd tv chip equipped bulldozerlets the entire initial ltm will allow remote operators worldwide to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and takeoff traveling and doing work the entire system is based on commercially available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware software developers by taking a graphically oriented communications program dmodem and adding a tele operations screen and controls the necessary user interface can be provided in under man hours plan of action the diaspar virtual reality network has agreed to sponsor this project by providing a host computer network and internet access to that network diaspar is providing the foot by foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model diaspar has in stock the electronic tanks that can be modified and one ccd tv chip diaspar also agrees to provide rail stock for the lunar train model diaspar will make available the dmodem graphical communications package and modify it for control of the machines lets an initial ground breaking with miniature shovels will be performed for a live photo session and news conference on april the initial models will be put in place a time lapse record will be started for historical purposes it is not expected that this event will be completely serious or solemn the lunar colony will be declared open for additional building operations and experiments a photographer will be present and the photographs taken will be converted to gif images for distribution world wide to major online networks and bbs s a press release will be issued calling for contributions of ideas time talent materials and scale models for the simulated lunar colony a contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then be announced universities will be invited to participate the goal being to find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of the lunar colony model field trips to ltm can be arranged and at that time the results of the class work will be added to the model contributors will then be able to tele operate any contributed machine lets once they return to their campus a monthly ltm newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via conventional means to the media any major new tele operated equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media having a large real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television community especially since the action will be controlled by people all over the world science fiction writers will be invited to issue challenges to engineering and human factors students at universities to build and operate the tele operated equipment to perform lunar tasks using counter weight and pulley systems gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges the long term goal is creating world wide interest education experimentation and remote operation of a lunar colony ltm has the potential of being a long term global edutainment method for space activities and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited to space edutainment all of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars conclusion edutainment is the blending of education and entertainment anyone who has ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for recreation education and experimentation purposes by creating a tele operated model lunar colony we not only create world wide publicity but also a method of trying new ideas that require real not virtual skills and open a new method for putting people s minds in space moonlighters illuminating the path of knowledge about space and lunar development the following people are already engaged in various parts of this work david rob dash hyson jzer vril wyatt the dark one tiggertoo the mad hatter sir robin jogden come join the discussion

re nasa wraps in article apr iti org aws iti org allen w sherzer writes in article apr judy uh edu wingo cspara decnet fedex msfc nasa gov writes i don t care who told you this it is not generally true i see every single line item on a contract and i have to sign it there is no such thing as wrap at this university dennis i have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions of customers included government including nasa for profit and non profit companies all expected a wrap usually called a fee much of the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors the subcontractors where universities for profits non profits and even some of the nasa centers for the commercialization of space all charged fees as part of the work down the street is one of the nasa commercialization centers they charge a fee you totally forgot the original post that you posted allen in that post you stated that the wrap was on top of and in addition to any overhead geez in this post you finally admit that this is not true now i m sure your a competent engineer dennis but you clearly lack experience in several areas your posts show that you don t understand the importance of integration in large projects you also show a lack of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it is reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything this isn t a flame jsut a statement come your little ol buns down here and you will find out who is doing what and who is working on integration this is simply an ad hominum attack and you know it your employer does charge a fee you may not see it but you do of course there is a fee it is for administration geez allen any organization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in legitimate costs such as libraries and other things that must be there to support a program and wrap as you originally stated it you stated that wrap was on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you say is not true which is it allen sounds like they are adding it to their overhead rate go ask your costing people how much fee they add to a project i did they never heard of it but suggest that like our president did that any percentage number like this is included in the overhead well there you are dennis as i said they simply include the fee in their overhead many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can change depending on the customer as you have posted on this subject allen you state that wrap is over and above overhead and is a seperate charge you admit here that this is wrong nasa has a line item budget every year i have seen it allen get some numbers from that detailed nasa budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then howl to high heaven about it until you do that you are barking in the wind no allen you did not you merely repeated allegations made by an employee of the overhead capital of nasa integration dennis isn t overhead nothing that reston does could not be dont better or cheaper at the other nasa centers where the work is going on integration could be done better at the centers apollo integration was done here at msfc and that did not turn out so bad the philosophy of reston is totally wrong allen there you have a bunch of people who are completely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee there is no way that will ever work it has never worked in any large scale project that it was ever tried on could you imagine a reston like set up for apollo dennis reston has been the only nasa agency working to reduce costs when wp was hemoraging out a billion the centers you love so much where doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem reston was the only place you would find people actually interested in solving the problems and building a station oh you are full of it allen on this one i agree that jsc screwed up big they should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it replaced to make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your bias goes come to msfc for a couple of weeks and you will find out just how wrong you really are maybe not people like you believe exactly what they want to believe no matter what the facts are contrary to it kinda funny isn t it that someone who talks about a problem like this is at a place where everything is overhead when you have a bit more experience dennis you will realize that integration isn t overhead it is the single most important part of a successful large scale effort i agree that integration is the single most important part of a successful large scale effort what i completly disagree with is seperating that integration function from the people that are doing the work it is called leadership allen that is what made apollo work final responsibility for the success of apollo was held by less than people that is leadership and responsibility there is neither when you have any organization set up as reston is you could take the same people and move them to jsc or msfc and they could do a much better job why did it take a year for reston to finally say something about the problem if they were on site and part of the process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place there is one heck of a lot i do not know allen but one thing i do know is that for a project to be successful you must have leadership i remember all of the turn over at reston that kept ssf program in shambles for years do you it is lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem lack of leadership from the white house congress and at reston nasa is only a symptom of a greater national problem you are so narrowly focused in your efforts that you do not see this why did the space news artice point out that it was the congressionally demanded change that caused the problems methinks that you are being selective with the facts again the story you refer to said that some nasa people blamed it on congress suprise suprise the fact remains that it is the centers you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn t address the problems until the press published the story are you saying the reston managers where wrong to get nasa to address the overruns you approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns no i am saying that if they were located at jsc it never would have happened in the first place if it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost of million a flight then you pay billion a year you stated that your friend at reston said that with the current station they could resupply it for a billion a year if the wrap were gone this merely points out a blatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail to see you should know dennis that nasa doesn t include transport costs for resuply that comes from the shuttle budget what they where saying is that operational costs could be cut in half plus transport sorry gang but i have a deadline for a satellite so someone else is going to have to do allen s math for him for a while i will have little chance to do so i do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it was wrong of reston to ask that the problems with wp be addressed i have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is at reston was on site at jsc the problem never would have happened totally ignoring the lack of leadership of congress this many headed hydra that has grown up at nasa is the true problem of the agency and to try to change the question to suit you and your bias is only indicative of your position dennis university of alabama in huntsville

crazy or just imaginitive i have a nice quote that i like or as close as i can remember it if i say something that you think is crazy ask me what i mean before you think its crazy so some of my ideas are a bit odd off the wall and such but so was wilbur and orville wright and quite a few others sorry if i do not have the big degrees and such but i think i might be wrong to error is human i have something that is in many ways just as important i have imagination dreams and without dreams all the knowledge is worthless sorry my two cents worth or is it two rubles worth the basic quote idea is from h beam pipers book space vikings its a good book on how civilization can fall and how it can be raised to new heights unfortunately h beam piper killed him self just weeks short of having his first book published and have his ideas see light such a waste

surviving large accelerations hi i was reading through the spaceflight handbook and somewhere in there the author discusses solar sails and the forces acting on them when and if they try to gain an initial acceleration by passing close to the sun in a hyperbolic orbit the magnitude of such accelerations he estimated to be on the order of g he also says that this is may not be a big problem for manned craft because humans and this was published in have already withstood accelerations of g all this is very long winded but here s my question finally are g accelerations in fact humanly tolerable with the aid of any mechanical devices of course if these are possible what is used to absorb the acceleration can this be extended to larger accelerations thanks is advance amruth laxman
eco freaks forcing space mining here is a way to get the commericial companies into space and mineral exploration basically get the eci freaks to make it so hard to get the minerals on earth you think this is crazy well in a way it is but in a way it is reality there is a billin the congress to do just that basically to make it so expensive to mine minerals in the us unless you can by off the inspectors or tax collectors ascially what i understand from talking to a few miner friends of mine that they the congress propose to have a tax on the gross income of the mine versus the adjusted income also the state governments have there normal taxes so by the time you get done paying for materials workers and other expenses you can owe more than what you made basically if you make a and spend ofor expenses you can owe in federal taxes bascially it is driving the miners off the land and the only peopel who benefit are the eco freaks basically to get back to my beginning statement is space is the way to go cause it might just get to expensive to mine on earth because of either the eco freaks or the protectionist such fun we have in these interesting times michael adams nsmca acad alaska edu i m not high just jacked

u s space foundation speech speech by pete worden delivered before the u s space foundation conference colorado springs colorado april what a delightful opportunity to cause some trouble for providing me this forum i would sincerely like to thank the u s space foundation my topic today is the single stage rocket technology rocket or ssrt by i intend to speak of more how to lower the cost and make rapid progress ssrt is to my mind and i hope to convince you the erupting a new rallying cry for our generation in space faster cheaper and better faster cheaper better and ssrt represent the passing of a torch from one technical generation to another it is a new thing to be sure but it is also a relearning of old things from past masters when we rolled out the ssrt baby two weeks ago so called experts told us it violates the laws of physics it made no sense for example dr eberhart rachtin former president of the aerospace corp said of ssrt in the l a times that it defies the best principles of launching payloads into space well dr rachtin you ve made us mad what are these principles that ssrt defies well i ll tell you it violates the principle that you need a giant program office to build space hardware it violates the fact that it takes years to build something new and it violates the truism that you cant do anything significant for less than many billions of dollars it took some of the last generation s experts to teach us some new old lessons werhner von braun s first rocket was not a saturn v general schriever s icbm s didn t take ten years to demonstrate and the x airplane didn t cost billion it took one of the great engineers of the s to remind us of these truths max hunter max to remind you was a senior engineer in the thor irbm program and old faster better cheaper success story max has been persistent in a vision of a single stage reusable space launch system since the s because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps build a little test a little next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration we didn t solicit a bunch of requirements they d just change every few years anyway not included in the speech the als nls has such ephemeral requirements that it would better known as shape shifter than space lifter we didn t spend a lot money this x rocket only cost million when s the last time we even built a new airplane for that and it didn t take a lot of time to build mcdonnell douglas completed it in months finally the government program office consisted of one very over worked air force major motivated in part by the threat that he d get to ride on it in a strapped on lawn chair if it ran over cost or schedule as i described what ssrt is and isn t keep in mind its only a first step there are several more steps and steps that can easily fail before the u s can field an ssto but each step should follow the same principles a small management team a few years technology demonstration and a modest budget let me show a few details on ssrt and how it might evolve see charts i m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last generation the giants of the last great space era the s and s they went to the moon we built a telescope that can t see straight they soft landed on mars the least we could do is soft land on earth but we do have an answer we can follow their build a little test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable and routine access to space i know there are nay sayers among you those who say ssrt is a stunt it needs more thermal protection the engines are wrong it would be better to land horizontally etc etc i say to you we ll see you at white sands in june you bring your view graphs and i ll bring my rocketship if we do what we say we can do then you let us do the next step not included in the speech if we fail you still have your program offices staff summary sheets requirement analyses and decade long programs i bet on my generation and max hunter s idea any takers

planets still images orbit by ether twist ether implodes earth core is gravity this paper both describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary ether sucking structures and why we observe orbital motion ether the theoretical propogation media of electro magnetic waves was concluded not to exist based on the results of the michelson moreley experiment conducted a century ago i propose that those conclusions are flawed based on the fact that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the earth s surface not perpindicular due to the prevailing assumption that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind the reversal of the that conclusion a pivotal keystone in the development of modern scientific thought could have ramifications of biblical proportions through out the world remember einstien said imagination is greater than knowledge i dream like this ether based reality the ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality creations start as a lattice placed into the ether given a spin the lattices both drag the fluid like a margarita blender and ingest it converting it distilling localized mass time and energy non spinning lattice dark matter the earth isn t exactly spinning around the sun picture an image of a galaxy we haven t any videos of them spinning picture us being stationary and the sun s image being dragged across the sky by the spinning ether field picture an onion each layer of which is spinning a little faster than the next a thread shot at the inner kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways its head being in a faster shell than its tail until it finally intersected the ground of the inner kernel its direction vector being straight down but its foot print being a line not a point sunrise sunset the moon isn t exactly orbiting us it is a parasite non self spin sustaining being dragged in the earth s ether field which is itself in the sun s much more powerful field our seasons are the wobble of earth s axis like a top slowing down the orbit of the earth around the sun is all of the stars images being dragged around by the sun s ether feild the earth moon and sun are about the same size and distance apart its just that the time between them varies greatly because the path is not the same the moon s lattice in the ether is like sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half turn the sun s lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has got the whole plate of noodles wound up the piece of light going to the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a j hook at the end the piece of light going to the sun has to go around the whole plate like a needle in a record before it gets there with a pencil compass and rule draw a diagram of how the moon can be about as big as earth s shadow upon it and at other times totally eclipse the sun look in the sky except for your knowledge would you guess that they are about the same size just because they look about the same size o e o o o s e m or m s the full moon quarter moon etc is the difference between rate of ether spins what we are looking at is a rotating turntable view of the moon only half of which is facing the sun i ve seen a half moon within about degrees of sky of the sun during the day try and draw that earth shadow its only the moon s image which appears to orbit us no matter where it is the light part is the part facing the sun and the dark part is the half facing away from the sun even when it appears to be behind us light years between galaxies is a misnomer the distance is closer to zero as time and matter are characteristics of this phase of reality which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion defining edge ether spin what we are seeing could be essentially happening now the piece of light may have experienced many years but the trip could be very quick our time to time travel or warp space i might consider learning to de spin myself phase out my mass good luck trying to design a propulsion system to drag around a space time locality its like trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within to find out about all of this i recommend studying history i d look in the book of life or holy grail etc brain waves just might carry decipherable data i d start looking on some part of the spectra said to be unusable due to all the background noise billion humans i d totally isolate myself record me thinking dog backwards and learn to read what i got microsoft holy grail card for pentium next concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time bound media the ether and that it is i who move forward in time i would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow of time which i d start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism pole to pole why not perhaps by passing a large flat dc current through a two foot diameter coil or choke or something and seeing what i could get with my machine s receiver next to it if you don t think you ll live to see it consider this quit putting the reproductive keys of other life in your body all of life s data could be written on the wind ether not just our thoughts dna could be a little receiver or file access code by eating seeds we could be jamming our reception or receiving plant instructions try eating seed bearing fruit maybe those greek or biblical guys did live hundreds of years i m curios to see what they did and ate don t worry if your hair stops growing maybe we don t need to eat at all the cosmos are formed from nothing and that is creating matter i only need enough to bounce around where did the household concept immortal come from wheat is a weed it is programmed to pull from the soil reproduce like hell and then die warning about writing to the past i had a little dream of being in a world in the near parallel future lying along a path of history which we have diverged from there were twelve telepathic glowing beings who looked like an oscar award and who had always been a dark one who looked like us and then myself the dark one was in the process of making the others into gods he had to teach them what that meant by advising them in their past basically he manipulated them into reproducing and raising their children on his seed he said that the little ones who looked different were a sub species meant to provide service he carefully combed through history rewriting it in his favor pulling like a weed anything that compromised his control he enticed recruits by sending them his visions saying that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve souls kill or be killed the amount of control he could exert was finite though as at every change he made a void would appear in our reality the universe one day ended meters from us it seemed odd but we couldn t remember how else it should be then some of the twelve were no more finally when he could prune no more and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips he stepped through his portal to the past to bask over and over in all that he had created i made a few more changes and lost my body existing only on the wind moral its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls whose will s are not in harmony with yours golden rule treat others as you wish to be treated i e you could end up along a lonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown nosers for playmates its not eternal there s more than one way back accepting rides to the past once here the one who looks like us sells rides he can make you a prince or a queen or you can live as a god in ancient greece go ahead repeat the third grade as often as you like adam henry i hope you like inspecting your socks careful though if he likes your work but thinks you re getting wise he can direct you to cross paths with your old self and you ll vanish as you rewrite your own course of history none the wiser as we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped back in time his hierarchy will lose its direction he can still make changes while he s here its just that that is work and with every adjustment this becomes less the world he cultivated which loosens his grip and his organization is suddenly one branch less but he can t see the change the basic nature of man is good he had to apply his hand to achieve his world as he now tightens his hand to retain what he built the more sand slips through his fingers how about public computer access to the i r s its our country our money and they re spending it on us right imagine this washington marks the next cost at irs collects gives to congress and just absolutely buries congress borrows the banks are making what a margin interest on our government big corporations are ecstatic if they can do a margin what do the banks do with it hold some on a carrot to the world sure but mostly bury it why food production is gnp construction hours to build your auto the people are spending all of their time to buy back a tenth of what they produce have we been deceived if we are more efficient why is it getting harder to get by what if the point is just to keep the people busy making widgets in that other reality i shouted to the twelve its chaos they said no its order he defined chaos as that which is he was not able to control rain forest the problem could be that all the water in its canopy would hide the location of an indigenous people who have no language telepathic and vanishing the closest knowledge of death think of the spine as a transceiver if it is on the ground and pointed up you can locate it from above these people are probably naive as children but very very tough to kill also they should be able to tell you stories about the dark one that i talk about they can hear him i think that ham and world band radio old timers might have a story to tell on this these people would be on a different frequency than us as they aren t eating seeds famine relief when i make my diet almost all whole wheat i get a huge belly lose muscle mass sleep a lot and get sick when i eat only fresh fruit i get more energy a hollywood flat belly and need a lot less sleep un peace keeping there is fighting and killing all over the troops go in when there is no bread on the shelf its ok to kill each other just make sure there is enough to eat somalia what is disturbing is energetic gun carrying three foot tall sixteen year olds who eat nothing but some roots that they suck on it is not so much that their growth is stunted it is that they aren t dying at a rate of of years per life women with children babes in arms historical references to women and children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut from the umbilical cord and hence were not breast fed i think that there may be some very interesting results to this such as mother child telepathy and blue blooded infants there are examples of this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate that guy is the master of illusion and the ultimate liar he tells it first and then just follows the thread of time in which the people are willing to buy it in which he can make it so he ll play a poker face up until he thinks he s cornered and then he ll whine beg and grovel all it means to him is that you re willing to live on the ground work that he has laid that is that he was right and he didn t over play his hand and he won t need to go back and try another thread of time you have ultimate control over your destiny just don t live along a path that leads to a reality in which you don t want to be a part of i don t claim to be the first to think these things its just that the others could have been pruned from our path maybe these thoughts given to me were laid down on the track of time after him

why dc will be the way of the future i once read an article on computer technology which stated that every new computer technology was actually lower and slower then what it replaced silicon was less effective then the germanium products then available gaas was less capable then silicon multi processors were slower then existent single processors what the argument was though was that these new technologies promised either theoretically future higher performance or lower cost or higher densities i think that the dc may g fit into this same model elv s can certainly launch more weight then a ssrt but an ssrt offers the prospect of greater cycle times and lower costs this is kind of a speculative posting but i thought i d throw it out as a hjistorical framework for those interested in the project pat

re abyss breathing fluids loss fs ece cmu edu doug loss writes besides the mechanical problems of moving so dense a medium in oan out of the lungs diaphragm fatigue etc is there likely to be a problem with the mixture i mean since the lungs never expel all the air in them the inhaled air has to mix pretty quickly with the residual air in the lungs to provide a useful partial pressure of oxygen right would this mixing be substantially faster slower at the pressures we re talking about there was an interesting article in scientific american some time ago about breathing liquid it was a few months before the abyss came out as far as i can remember they mentioned three things that were difficult to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid low viscosity if it s too difficult to force the fluid in out of the lungs you can t extract enough oxygen to power your own breathing effort let alone anything else diffusion rate obviously not all the air in your lungs is expelled when you breathe out and the part that isn t expelled is the part that s nearest the walls of the alveoli alveolus so the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done by diffusion of the gas through the fluid apparently oxygen tends to diffuse more readily than co so even if you can get enough oxygen in you might not be able to get enough co out oxygen co capacity you have to be able to dissolve enough gas per unit volume oh and of course your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs or interfere with their healing or anything like that wim lewis wiml u washington edu

sirtf mission is still alive from the jpl universe april sirtf is still very much in business by mark whalen in these times of extra tight nasa budgets the very survival of a number of missions has been uncertain but thanks to major design refinements implemented in recent months jpl s space infrared telescope facility sirtf a major project considered to be in trouble a couple of years ago is alive and well according to project scientist michael werner a lighter spacecraft revised orbit and shorter mission have added up to a less expensive project with tremendous scientific power and a bright future said werner designed as a follow up to the highly successful infrared astronomical satellite iras and cosmic background explorer cobe missions sirtf a cryogenically cooled observatory for infrared astronomy from space is scheduled for launch in or if plans proceed as scheduled iras pioneering work in space based infrared astronomy years ago allowed astronomers to view the milky way as never before and revealed among other things galaxies and comets it provided a sky survey times more sensitive than any previously available from ground based observations cobe has measured the infrared and microwave background radiation on large angular scales and revealed new facts about the early universe but to illuminate sirtf s potential jim evans jpl s manager of astrophysics and fundamental physics pre projects recently said that the project is to million times more capable than iras based on technological advances in infrared detector arrays however despite the enormous strides in infrared exploration sirtf promised and the fact that it was cited as the highest priority new initiative for all of astronomy in the s by the national academy of sciences it took a diet or die directive from nasa headquarters last year to keep the project going according to werner the project is now known as atlas sirtf based on the key factor in its new design the satellite will orbit the sun instead of the earth permitting the use of an atlas rocket launch instead of the formerly proposed and heavier titan the main advantage of the solar orbit is that you can use all of your launch capability for boosting the payload you don t have to carry up a second rocket to circularize the orbit werner said the other advantage to a solar orbit he said is that it s in a better thermal environment away from the heat of the earth additional major changes in sirtf s redesign include shortening the mission from five to three years and building a spacecraft that is less than half as heavy as in the original plan atlas sirtf will weigh kilograms pounds compared to titan sirtf s kilograms pounds all of that adds up to a less stressful launch environment werner said and a cost savings of more than million for the launch in addition to increased savings in the design of the smaller less massive spacecraft werner said sirtf s redesign came as a result of congress telling nasa you re trying to do too many things if you want us to support sirtf which is a good project develop a plan to see how it fits into nasa s overall strategy shortly thereafter sirtf was named as nasa s highest priority flagship scientific mission by the interdisciplinary space sciences advisory committee in addition to the blessing from the national academy of sciences while the spacecraft and its instruments required descoping to keep the project alive sirtf s major scientific contribution always promised to come about from its advanced infrared detector arrays which will allow images to be developed tens of thousands of times faster than before according to evans up until a couple of years ago werner said all infrared astronomy was done with single detectors or very small arrays of individually assembled detectors since then the department of defense has developed a program to produce arrays of tens or hundreds of thousands of detectors rather than just a few and those are very well suited for use on sirtf werner noted that in addition to dealing with budget pressures congress is currently watching nasa projects with an eye out for any technological spinoff on that question i think we have some things to say he said because the detectors we re using are straight off various military developments also sirtf will be built by the u s aerospace industry and it s a real technological and engineering challenge in addition to being a tremendous scientific project sirtf will be used by the entire astronomical community werner added but the revised three year mission puts a premium on observing time we have to educate the user community and develop a program that involves early surveys and quick turnaround of the data werner said the downsizing of the project required a reduction in scope and complexity of sirtf s three instruments the infrared spectrograph infrared array camera and multiband imaging photometer however these reductions will only result in losses of efficiency rather than capability he said the project hopes to start a phase b activity in which will provide a detailed concept for development and design building the hardware would begin about two years later projected cost estimates evans said are million million i am very optimistic about sirtf he said it will provide a tremendous return for the investment werner added that an additional benefit from the project will be the enrichment of our intellectual and cultural environment people on the street are very interested in astronomy black holes the possibility of life on other planets the origin of the universe and those are the kind of questions sirtf will help answer ron baalke baalke kelvin jpl nasa gov jet propulsion lab m s telos the aweto from new zealand

jpl s vlbi project meets with international space agencies from the jpl universe april vlbi project meets with international space agencies by ed mcnevin members of jpl s space very long baseline interferometry vlbi project team recently concluded a week long series of meetings with officials from russia and japan the meetings were part of space vlbi week held at jpl in early march and were intended to maintain cooperation between international space agencies participating in the development of the u s space vlbi project a recently approved jpl flight project set for launch in u s space vlbi will utilize two earth orbiting spacecraft the japanese vsop vlbi space observing program satellite with its meter radio telescope and a russian radioastron meter satellite both spacecraft will team up with ground based radio telescopes located around the world to create a radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radio telescope observing power by a factor of japan s vsop satellite will use a limited six hour orbit to conduct imaging science while the russian radioastron spacecraft will exploit a larger hour earth orbit to conduct exploratory radio astronomy each satellite will point at a source target for roughly hours while approximately ground based radio telescopes will simultaneously point at the same source object while within view on earth according to dr joel smith jpl s project manager for the u s space vlbi meetings like those held at jpl will permit japan and russia who have little previous experience in radio interferometry to establish working relationships with the radio astronomy communities that will be vital during the complex observations required by the space vlbi project one of our main activities is developing the methodology for international coordination because the two spacecraft simultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations while using the ground based radio telescopes to observe the same celestial objects said smith three new tracking antennas are being built at dsn facilities and other three other tracking facilities located in japan russia and green bank w va this global network of ground based radio telescopes will use precision clocks and high speed recorders to collect observation data and forward the information to a correlator located at the national radio astronomy observatory in socorro n m the correlator will combine and process data then make it available to mission investigators in moscow tokyo and jpl via electronic mail smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope created by the space vlbi network will provide radio astronomers with better resolution than has ever been achieved before by ground based radio telescopes allowing astronomers to take a closer look at distant objects in space there is a long history of radio astronomy using ground based telescopes said smith what we intend to do is to extend radio astronomy into earth orbit our goal is to look deeper into the cores of galactic nuclei quasars and other active radio sources to understand what drives those things we have seen so far with radio astronomy smith noted that if one examines the active galactic nuclei you ll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater than light and at energy levels that are millions of times greater than you would expect he said some astronomers believe that black holes may be located in the cores of these galaxies and that they may fuel the jets smith hopes that by using space vlbi to look further into the cores this theory may be supported or disproved russian space flight hardware including transponders and transmitters are now being tested in the united states and japanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later this year analysis of this hardware will permit u s scientists and engineers to understand how to modify the high speed vlba correlator operating at the nrao in order to accommodate the odd data patterns that will originate from the more than ground based radio telescopes involved in space vlbi smith is particularly pleased that meetings with the japanese and russian space agency officials like those held at jpl in march have proceeded smoothly yet he knows that the political uncertainty in russia could jeopardize that country s participation in the project nothing is ever smooth he said but the russians have been incredibly open with us we always anticipated some likelihood that we will not succeed because of political factors beyond our control yet there tends to be a way of keeping these things going because scientists on both sides are trying hard and people recognize the value of cooperation at this level smith points out that the japanese space agency has more at stake than just fulfilling an international commitment to a science mission the japanese have been extremely cooperative since international cooperation is essential to their science mission he said but smith also noted that japanese space agency officials look at the u s space vlbi mission as an opportunity to showcase the technology involved with vsop spacecraft and their highly regarded mach v launch vehicle yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such an ambitious project jpl s smith is satisfied that planning for the space vlbi project is beyond the significant financial and political hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project fortunately we have the virtue of having two partners and if either falls out we would still have something with the other by themselves both spacecraft are independent scientifically exciting missions ron baalke baalke kelvin jpl nasa gov jet propulsion lab m s telos the aweto from new zealand pasadena ca is part caterpillar and part vegetable

space station redesign jsc alternative i have mb worth uuencode d gif images contain charts outlining one of the many alternative space station designs being considered in crystal city mr mark holderman works down the hall from me and can be reached for comment at or via e mail at mholderm jscprofs nasa gov mark proposed this design which he calls geode rough on the outside but a gem on the inside or the et strongback with integrated hab modules and centrifuge as you can see from file geodea gif it uses a space shuttle external tank et in place of much of the truss which is currently part of space station freedom the white track on the outside of the et is used by the station remonte manipulator system srms and by the reaction control system rcs pod this allows the rcs pod to move along the track so that thrusting can occur near the center of gravity cg of the station as the mass properties of the station change during assembly the inline module design allows the shuttle to dock more easily because it can approach closer to the station s cg and at a structurally strong part of the station in the current ssf design docking forces are limited to pounds which seriously constrains the design of the docking system the et would have a hatch installed pre flight with little additional launch mass we ve always had the ability to put an et into orbit contrary to some rumors which have circulated here but we ve never had a reason to do it while we have had some good reasons not to performance penalties control debris generation and eventual de orbit and impact footprint once on orbit we would vent the residual h the et insulation sofi either a erodes on orbit from impact with atomic oxygen or b stays where it is and we deploy a kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating the local space environment option b has the advantage of providing further micrometeor protection the et is incredibly strong remember it supports the whole stack during launch and could serve as the nucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits the white module at the end of et contains a set of control moment gyros to be used for attitude control while the rcs will be used for gyro desaturation the module also contains a de orbit system which can be used at the end of the station s life to perform a controlled de orbit so we don t kill any more kangaroos like we did with skylab the centrifuge which has the same volume as a hab module could be used for long term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity on humans the centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device for the whole attitude control system the centrifuge is mounted on one of the modules opposite the et and the solar panels this design uses most of the existing ssf designs for electrical data and communication systems getting leverage from the ssf work done to date mark proposed this design at joe shea s committee in crystal city and he reports that he was warmly received however the rumors i hear say that a design based on a wingless space shuttle orbiter seems more likely please note that this text is my interpretation of mark s design you should see his notes in the gif files instead of posting a mb file to sci space i tried to post these for anon ftp in ames arc nasa gov but it was out of storage space i ll let you all know when i get that done ken jenks nasa jsc gm space shuttle program office kjenks gothamcity jsc nasa gov development of the space station is as inevitable as the rising of the sun wernher von braun

what counntries do space surveillance ethnocentric usian that i am i ve assumed that we and the xussr were the only countries with significant capabilities to track non cooperative objects in low earth orbit grazing in a couple of databases recently i found that japan has some optical capabilities along this line and also uses a radar designed for other purposes for orbital debris surveys it isn t clear whether the radar can determine orbital elements for the objects it detects abstracts of the articles are appended this leads to the more general question do yet other people than the us russia and japan do space surveillance and if so how and why allen thomson saic mclean va usa abstracts optical tracking of the experimental geodetic satellite egs takabe masao itabe toshikazu aruga tadashi radio research laboratory review issn x vol march p in japanese with abstract in english this paper reports the optical tracking results of egs experimental geodetic satellite which was launched on august by nasda the egs optical tracking experiment process and an outline of the radio research laboratory rrl optical ground station are discussed a star tracking technique for optical equipment calibration and satellite tracking technique for orbit prediction improvement are also described the accuracy of egs tracking data obtained by rrl at the request of nasda is also discussed in addition it is briefly demonstrated that the position of the japanese amateur satellite jas which was launched with the egs was accurately determined by means of a satellite tracking video it is clear from this experiment that optical observation data i e satellite direction data are very useful for satellite orbit determination during initial launch stages furthermore the results confirm the effectivenes of these two satellite optical tracking techniques mu radar measurements of orbital debris sato toru kayama hidetoshi furusawa akira kimura iwane kyoto university japan aiaa nasa and dod orbital debris conference technical issues and future directions baltimore md apr p rpn aiaa paper distributions of orbital debris versus height and scattering cross section are determined from a series of observations made with a high power vhf doppler radar mu radar of japan an automated data processing algorithm has been developed to discriminate echoes of orbiting objects from those of undesired signals such as meteor trail echoes or lightning atmospherics although the results are preliminary they showed good agreement with those from norad tracking radar observations using a much higher frequency it is found that the collision frequency of a space station of km x km size at an altitude of km with orbiting debris is expected to be as high as once per two years monitoring of the mu radar antenna pattern by satellite ohzora exos c sato t inooka y fukao s kyoto univ japan kato s kyoto univ uji japan radio atmospheric science center in international council of scientific unions middle atmosphere program handbook for map vol p publication date jun as the first attempt among mst mesosphere stratosphere troposphere type radars the mu middle and upper atmosphere radar features an active phased array system unlike the conventional large vhf radars in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed to individual antenna elements each of solid state power amplifier feeds each antenna element this system configuration enables very fast beam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the antenna into independent subarrays because phase shift and signal division combination are performed at a low signal level using electronic devices under control of a computer network the antenna beam can be switched within microsec to any direction within the zenith angle of deg since a precise phase alignment of each element is crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system careful calibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna element was carried out among various aircraft which may be used for this purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to make a long term monitoring with the same system an antenna pattern monitoring system for the mu radar was developed using the scientific satellite ohzora exos c a receiver named mum mu radar antenna monitor on board the satellite measures a cw signal of to watts transmitted from the mu radar the principle of the measurement and results are discussed equatorial radar system fukao shoichiro tsuda toshitaka sato toru kato susumu kyoto

radar with the sensitivity of an incoherent scatter radar for observing the whole equatorial atmosphere up to km altitude is now being designed in japan the radar will be built in pontianak west kalimantan indonesia deg n deg e the system is a mhz monostatic doppler radar with an active phased array configuration similar to that of the mu radar in japan which has been in successful operation since it will have a pa product of about x to the th w sq m p average transmitter power a effective antenna aperture with a sensitivity of approximately times that of the mu radar this system configuration enables pulse to pulse beam steering within deg from the zenith as is the case of the mu radar a variety of operations will be made feasible under the supervision of the radar controller

re surviving large accelerations amruth laxman al andrew cmu edu writes hi i was reading through the spaceflight handbook and somewhere in there the author discusses solar sails and the forces acting on them when and if they try to gain an initial acceleration by passing close to the sun in a hyperbolic orbit the magnitude of such accelerations he estimated to be on the order of g he also says that this is may not be a big problem for manned craft because humans and this was published in have already withstood accelerations of g all this is very long winded but here s my question finally are g accelerations in fact humanly tolerable with the aid of any mechanical devices of course if these are possible what is used to absorb the acceleration can this be extended to larger accelerations are you sure g is the right number as far as i know pilots are blackout in dives that exceed g g g seems to be out of human tolerance would anybody clarify this please lan thanks is advance amruth laxman

dc y trajectory simulation i ve been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest i ve transcribed some of my notes below since my note taking ability is by no means infallible please assume that all factual errors are mine permission is granted to copy this without restriction note for newbies the delta clipper project is geared towards producing a single staget to orbit reusable launch vehicle the dc x vehicle is a scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in ssto it is currently undergoing tests the dc y vehicle would be a full scale experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit it has not yet been funded on april th rocky nelson of macdonnell douglas gave a talk entitled optimizing techniques for advanced space missions here at the university of illinois mr nelson s job involves using software to simulate trajectories and determine the optimal trajectory within given requirements although he is not directly involved with the delta clipper project he has spent time with them recently using his software for their applications he thus used the dc y project for most of his examples while i don t think the details of implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers i hope they aren t i fell asleep during that part i think that many of you will be interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples the first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit the main restriction is that acceleration must remain below gs i assume that this is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints but i did not verify that the delta clipper y version has engines boosters and sustainers the boosters which have a lower isp are shut down in mid flight thus one critical question is when to shut them down mr nelson showed the following plot of acceleration vs time g as ascii graphs go this is actually fairly good the big difference is that the lines g made by the should be curves which are concave up the data is only approximate as the graph wasn t up for very long g g sec sec as mentioned before a critical constraint is that g levels must be kept below initially all eight engines are started as the vehicle burns fuel the accelleration increases as it gets close to g the booster engines are throtled back however they quickly become inefficient at low power so it soon makes more sense to cut them off altogether this causes the dip in accelleration at about seconds eventually the remaining sustainer engines bring the g level back up to about and then hold it there until they cut out entirely the engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit the trajectory is aimed for an altitude slightly higher than the nm desired and the last vestiges of air drag slow the vehicle slightly thus lowering the final altitude to that desired questions from the audience paraphrased q would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs rather than all at once a very perceptive worth considering they have not yet done the simulation shutting down all four was part of the problem as given q so what was the final payload for this trajectory a can t tell us read aviation leak he also apparently had a good propulsion example but was told not to use it my question does anyone know if this security is due to sdio protecting national security or md protecting their own interests the second example was reentry simulation from orbit to just before the pitch up maneuver the biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating and the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange he showed graphs of heating using two different models to show that both were very similar and i think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate the end result was that for a polar orbit landing at ksc the dc y would have about degrees of crossrange and would start it s reentry profile about degrees south latitude i would have asked about the landing maneuvers but he didn t know about that aspect of the flight profile josh hopkins jbh uxa cso uiuc edu find a way or make one attributed to hannibal
rimsat us russian joint venture i ve been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest i ve transcribed some of my notes below since my note taking ability is by no means infallible please assume that all factual errors are mine permission is granted to copy this without restriction michael sternberg cheif of operations of rimsat was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by acdis here on the campus of the university of illinois acdis is an organization on campus that deals with arms control disarmament and international security rimsat was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using russian launchers and satellites i think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the international relations program the concept behind rimsat apparently began when matt neilson went to tonga to visit a friend while he was there he somehow ended up visiting the king who happened to be a big tv fan matt bought the king a satellite dish which the king thought was really nifty since tonga has a gnp of about million his majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this matt thought there probably was so at his suggestion tonga applied for geosynchronous satellite slots while this isn t entirely off the wall it was very unusual seeing as tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program and is a lot of slots the whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and carl hilliard who is apparently a respected space lawyer wrote several opinions supporting tonga s case eventually tonga ended up with slots ranging from e to e slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside according to sternberg four of these from e to e are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between hawaii and the pacific rim rimsat was formed to use these slots it was officially formed in nevis as a tax haven they tried for a few years to raise funds in the west however to fill slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately billion it s not easy to raise that kind of money eventually they hit upon the idea of using russian hardware they began negotiating with glavkosmos for hardware mr sternberg describes operating in moscow in such harsh terms that i don t think i ll visit there for a long time besides a significant lack of creature comforts he was not happy with the way that people operate for example everybody can sell you everything everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by eventually rimsat arranged a deal with glavkosmos for satellites at a cost of million however glavkosmos lost favor after the coup sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of kgb operatives who went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures since glavkosmos was out of power he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities he again described life in a moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms eventually he worked out a deal and on dec he met with koptev who heads the russian space program to sign the deal koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to sternberg he arranged these new rules to allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as rimsat the next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware npo applied mechanics npo pm to use their acronym this organization is located in siberia can t figure out how to spell the town i need an atlas and has built about vehicles since the dawn of the space age sternberg commented that siberians are very different from musovites they are hard workers honest people who team up to get things done very much like midwesterners at this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners sternberg had lots of good things to say about npo pm his company is apparently lookng for million to invest in the firm to become partners it apparently costs the russians about million to build a satellite that would sell for million in the west if you want to give them specifications they ll build you a satellite for the particular satellites that rimsat will be using costs run about per transponder year this compares to t y in the u s they can sell their time for about million compared to million in the u s rimsat will launch their satellites on protons to get the best prices they bought in bulk they have the rights to twelve launches so if any of you need a lift i can give you their address the first launch is scheduled for october and they are getting one used satellite from the russians which is being moved into place now tidbits sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs not big business because big business is just like what they have over there except that we have better paper both in the bathroom and in the copier russian launches are self insured the promise to replace a failed launch within months major investors in rimsat include russell which is a huge retirement fund organization cellsat which is a big telecom business in southeast asia and a fund operated by some of the big names in u s aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off he downplayed the instabilites in the ex ussr saying that we are worried partly because we aren t used to seeing russia as anything but an unvarying monolith italy gets a new government every two weeks but we don t worry because we re used to it he predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in russia we won t worry about their stability as much part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money the central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments putting in their coffers and replacing the rest with the equivalent value in rubles to get around this rimsat pays their hard currency into an austrian bank account npo pm then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government one of the big problems rimsat has had is stonewalling by the western satellite industry however intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites which was rather reassuring the biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime the older gorizont horizon satellites have a lifetime of about years while the more modern express satellites compare well with western technology and last about years while this is much shorter than years for western satellites sternberg downplayed the difference at these prices they can afford to launch new ones in addition shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older out of date hardware josh hopkins jbh uxa cso uiuc

and after the house quiets down at night so data can quickly build up if there s a lot of other stuff going on i ve complied a lot of information and happenings since the last column so i m going to have to work to keep this one down to a readable length have fun contents us commercial space sales flatten in delta wins two key launch contracts commercial remote sensing venture gets doc go ahead investment firm calls gd s space biz still a good investment ariane predicts dip in launch demand ntsb investigates pegasus launch over aborted abort another pegasus competitor is announced georgia launch site dropped from planning spain s capricornia launcher still proceeding pacastro signs launch reservation with swedish space corp china and taiwan joint satellite venture reported south korea announces national move into space technologies space technology indexes through march final notes articles us commercial space sales flatten in the us department of commerce projects us commercial space sales will remain flat in with current data showing only a percent growth over as published in us industrial outlook which was released in january revenues from the us space business are currently projected to be about m in contrast to previous years when us commercial space sales had shown double digits growth rates this year s projected results are driven by the us satellite manufacturing industry where sales are projected to drop from satellites worth m in to satellites worth m in the us industrial outlook also projects u s commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year and while predicting that revenues will increase percent to m future sales will be adversely affected by the downward revision in department of defense launch plans offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to increase to m primarily driven by increased revenues from broadcast and cable tv networks similarly remote sensing products and sales are projected to increase to m in up us commercial space revenues r e commercial satellites satellite services fixed mobile satellite ground equip mobile equipment commercial launches remote sensing data and services private microgravity research lab total annual revenues r revised data for e estimated data for commentary this is the first look at how the us commercial space industry is expected to do in in general not a bad report with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite manufacturing area there changes of only a few satellites worth m or so apiece can substantially influence the annual projection if we look forward over several years this market sector should retain strong sales as us firms have been very successful in regaining international market share in the satellite business furthermore sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in the next revision of this data expected to be released about mid year data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales including such items as gps receivers and portable satellite terminals appears to be missing from the january data set doc usually publishes a listing of space business indicators in mid year and the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released then i expect the revised revenues should easily top m if the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the numbers and the year should show about a overall market growth looking beyond this year s data future markets look quite promising the doc projects satellite service revenues could top m by if new mobile satellite services and direct broadcasting are implemented as planned and that mobile satellite station sales are expected to continue to growth at per year through the mid s my numbers are somewhat more pessimistic for near term market growth but i agree the trend should be for substantial growth in us commercial space sales over at least the next years my pessimism is due to more conservative assumptions on market capture and growth in leo communications and satellite direct broadcasting services i don t believe all of the current players in the yet to be born leo communications satellite market and in the yet to be proven direct broadcasting market will be financial successes nor that sales growth will be as explosive as currently projected it should also be noted this year s doc data is the first release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research facilities the m shown in the janurary data is primarily for the spacehab module planned for launch in april on the space shuttle but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first sales from the comet orbital launch and recovery experiment module delta wins two key launch contracts mcdonnell douglas corporation which builds and markets the delta launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts motorola inc announced in mid february that it had selected the delta to launch most of the satellites in the satellite iridium leo communications constellation and in mid april mcdonnell douglas was awarded the usaf medium launch vehicle iii contract the launch services contract with motorola for the iridium constellation launch is for at launch of least iridium satellites another satellites have been contracted to be launched by khrunichev enterprise in russian on proton vehicle launches these satellites planned for the delta will be launched at a time providing for at least launches additional satellites in the iridium constellation such as a planned on orbit spares may also be launched on delta although details of the launch services contract were reported to be negotiation and not yet final the usaf mlv contract also went to mdc bidding a variant of their delta ii launcher this contract is only initially worth million but establishes a set of launch options for up to launches encompassing launches from through these launches will deploy the next generation of the usaf s global positioning system block iir navigation satellites plus other programs first option for to meet the usaf launch options is expected to be exercised this year after which the usaf is expected to request launches of up to deltas per year for at least years under this contract the usaf can also request launch on demand services from mdc for the time period with a launch to occur within days of the request commentary if these two contracts are fulfilled they should provide an excellent business base for mdc s delta launch program through the turn of the century combined these two contracts have a potential for about launches worth about m to mdc and sustaining a core business base of m year other contracts for international and commercial payloads as well as for nasa medium elv class payloads will add to this business base keeping mdc as a viable commerical launch company however it should be noted there are risk elements in these contracts motorola s iridium leo communications constellation has not yet received a us federal communications commission license for operation in the u s nor has motorola lined up all the financing and financial partners for the iridium venture without these approvals or financial backing there will be no iridium launches but hopefully these uncertainties will be settled this year similarly the usaf mlv iii program has been the target of several congressional actions which have slowed the production of the gps block iir satellites and deleted the funding for the mlv iii program in favor of the usaf nls spacelifter program at this time while it appears the mlv iii contract will be executed future funding for the mlv iii and other usaf commercial launch contracts is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy reviews some opinions expressed from within the administration and congress propose cancellation of all elv upgrade programs including the mlv programs in favor of the proposed spacelifter program such opinions may have some weight in this year s budget deliberations particularly as dod funds will be more difficult to find in the shrinking us defense budget commercial remote sensing venture gets doc go ahead the first commercial license to operate a remote sensing satellite was approved in early february by the us department of commerce s office of space commerce a license was granted to worldview imaging corporation of oakland california to build and operate a pair of leo imaging satellites to provide multi spectral images of the earth commentary there has been little data released on this venture by worldview and the doc other than the announcement of the operating and construction license this was reported to be at the request of worldview most industry speculation identifies this new venture as a star wars spinoff using sdi type technology to provide digital earth sensing data and heavily integrated into digital gis databases for remote sensing gis users most probable customers for this service include exploration geologists agricultural planners and urban planners it is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the land remote sensing policy act the act as passed last november provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices prior to this act remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to all users at the same prices and private remote sensing ventures would have had to sell at the government set landsat data prices there are rumors of several other potential commercial remote sensing ventures working their way through the system at different stages of development i think the large landsat and spot satellite systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing data market for the next decade or so in contrast to these large government sponsored remote sensing systems smaller market ventures such as worldview and others can exploit market niches and use innovative technology and i believe can find profitability on the margin i predict there may be some very interesting ventures appearing in the next year or so investment firm calls gd s space biz still a good investment wall street investment house morgan stanley thinks general dynamic s space systems division could still be a moneymaker despite having failed in the last atlas launches in a recent analyst s report morgan stanley said we are more than ever convinced that if the company can return the atlas to its historical plus success rate this will become a highly profitable cash generating unit based upon discussions with gd s corporate management morgan stanley projects that if the atlas problems are cleared up the unit could see m in earnings per year by and m per year by this is based upon gd s projection of capturing about atlas launches per year on the world market commentary three failures in a row of their launch system has hurt general dynamic s space systems division since gd has restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses many market pundits have been speculating gd s space business might be next to be sold the morgan stanley report indicates gd s space systems division has some potential as a moneymaker despite current problems if they can get their act together sales are projected to be about m in which will probably generate a loss of about m if gd can capture their projected share of the space launch market and if they have managed to clean up the reliability of their atlas launchers then they could generate healthy profits from those sales but until they demonstrate the atlas centaur program is back on track this division will continue to show substantial losses in response to the sell off rumors in my opinion this operation is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability to do such a takeover the current set corporate and divisional management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm in gd ssd s case to get the division back on track the management team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with the atlas centaur as well as in selling atlas services this would indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch operations could find such talent in house and be able to convince customers to buy their launch services optimally the firm would have substantial liquid rocket experience and experience in marketing space technology internationally as well candidates for this might be trw rockwell lockheed and martin and possibly mcdonnell douglas and boeing but most of those firms have cash flow problems mdc have had a substantial business contraction boeing and mdc are involved with other launch firms lockheed or have taken on substantial debt martin and coming up with the m purchase price for the division is a big chunk of change for any company ariane predicts dip in launch demand arianespace the operator of the ariane launch system is projecting a dip in launch demand in the late s in early february arianespace released their annual market survey which detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the next decade over short run arianespace expects to retain their dominant position and sustain a majority share of the launch market of international and commercial launches planned through ariane holds contracts for general dynamics atlas vehicle holds contracts mcdonnell douglas delta holds and great wall s long march vehicle holds launch contracts three quarters of future launch contracts for which ariane can compete are projected to come from communications satellites with the remaining split between weather earth observation and scientific satellites most of the future telecommunications demand growth is predicted to come from the asia pacific region arianespace expects the current market consolidation of individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will continue with these groups investing in heavier satellites with larger communications payloads carrying more transponders arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications satellites should increase by over today s average level to about kg in geo demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain strong over the next three years but in the second half of the decade arianespace predicts demand will decrease arianespace bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder demand and supply particularly as new data compression techniques appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing or near term transponders one of the significant possible changes in the market was identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles including russian launch systems but arianespace predicts that in the long term investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade off between launch service quality and price and that russian and other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities and service quality and their market penetration will be minimal commentary ariane releases their market surveys annually and i reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of csn sti comparing the two surveys there aren t outstanding differences in the numbers the most notable change is the consideration of new data compression techniques reducing the demand for new physical transponders on orbit i note that in contrast to some predictions demand for space based communications transponders appears to be remain strong while fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the established point to point telecommunications markets growing demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point to multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space transponder demand fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability service but only from established point a to established point b to establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable between the points and while there are improved network solutions installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost millions or billions of dollars for broadcast services where there is not an existing ground network structure satellites still offer the most cost effective solution and if new services are required into a new region it is cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite network this allows rapid growth of new satellite services and has kept demand high the replacement market for fiberoptics is growing as well since as demand grows between the points serviced it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to handle the increase in traffic since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still growing rapidly satellite market projections remain rosy but satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes current generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at years of on orbit service or more in contrast to years of service from last generation s satellites this has cut back some of the launch demand as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite launches over longer intervals and as last note arianespace didn t flag it this year but it looks like the space transportation market will be rather over supplied by existing launch systems in the near term the annual commercial launch demand is for about medium sized satellites per year from the supply side ariane is capable of launching up to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year delta is capable of about per year atlas is capable of long march japan s h vehicle russia s proton capable of and other systems such as zenit and soyuz another medium launches per year that s a lot of capability for a small market we can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial launches ntsb investigates pegasus launch over aborted abort the feb pegasus launch by orbital sciences corporation has spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety rules a valid abort order from a nasa range safety officer to halt the mission was overridden and the pegasus was launched in violation of range safety rules in the last few minutes of the pegasus launch countdown one of two abort command receivers aboard the pegasus failed such a failure typically scrubs a launch and a nasa range safety officer at wallops island va issued a mission abort order about a minute before the scheduled pegasus launch somehow this command was overridden by the osc launch team or the message was lost in the communications channels and the pegasus was launched despite the valid abort call fortunately the pegasus functioned as expected and the abort command receiver was not needed but this incident did spark an investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed to launch constraint rules and was not obeyed leading the investigation is the national transportation safety board ntsb with support from nasa osc and the air force this investigation marks the first time ntsb has taken the lead on an incident involving a space launch according to the ntsb their investigation will take about months and is primarily looking at lines of authority communications links and safety procedures used in the launch commentary this is the first time that the ntsb has led an investigation into a space launch their leadership was requested by the department of commerce s office of commercial space transportation who had licensed the commercial launch at the time of writing this column some of the initial investigations have been concluded and some of the results are starting to leak out into the trade press apparently or four different communications channels were in use during the test after the abort destruct receiver stopped responding the nasa test director and range controller in the mission control room at wallops island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch according to the mission rules this should have stopped the launch somehow the osc test conductor ordered the abort reversed and the nasa communicator on the net relayed that order to the b carrying the pegasus at about seconds before launch differing explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed with the best set being that clear lines of communications and clear definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team and understanding of the mission rules were not established before the launch as we see more and more commercial launches more of these procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved this case is interesting because it is the first time the ntsb has been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem as they do with commercial aircraft problems i think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with procedures and communications and will be cleared up with issuance of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how specific lines of authority should be delineated another pegasus competitor is announced tsniimach enterprise in russia announced it is marketing a new small space launch system based upon converted icbm components two versions of the launcher are being marketed the aerokosmos winged vehicle launched like the osc pegasus and the severkosmos launched from a mobile ground transporter the aerokosmos is projected to deliver kg to a km circular orbit or kg to an km circular orbit and the severkosmos to be capable of kg to km orbits and kg to km also proposed to be used with these launch systems is a leo data relay system called sineva tsniimach enterprise is described as a ex military establishment focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the buran shuttle system they are located near the npo energia facility in kaliningrad outside of moscow commentary there s very little released information on this new venture my suspicion is it is another russian enterprise looking for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in house knowledge of ex soviet launch systems it adds to the list of numerous commercial space startups announced from the ex soviet union this one s a little different in that they are offering variants of ex soviet icbms but i can t identify any key customers being targeted or substantial financial backing georgia launch site dropped from planning in late january georgia tech research institute released the results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial rocket launching site in camden county georgia at the old kingsland missile test launching site on the atlantic coast the preliminary study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch site stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected low investment returns plus environmental and other geographic considerations however the report did say the site might be ideal for other aerospace uses and recommended other potential uses commentary this should put the nails in the coffin of the kingsland commercial launch site while other sites are still proceeding with commercial launch site development plans kingsland found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant and if substantial infrastructure had to be put in then the expected returns were too low to justify the cost of development this might point out some key discriminators in judging the feasibility of a commercial launch site these include is there an identified key customer to provide core usage sufficient to recover setup costs is there a market advantage of using the site can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site can financing be found at low enough cost to support the investment other commercial launch site ventures including those at woomera poker flat cape york white sands alabama off shore platform hawaii and vandenberg have to also be judged against these criteria in my opinion some of these ventures are flying on hope and speculation and not on sound financial grounds spain s capricornia launcher still proceeding in one of his last official acts former president bush authorized space technology transfer for several joint space ventures between us and other firms one of these was a proposed use of us technology by spain to build a small booster with that regulatory impediment removed the stage capricornia launch vehicle will start development later this year planning for a first launch in the time period the capricornia is described as a small stage all solid booster designed to put kg into leo several launch sites are being examined for the system including on the iberian peninsula and on the canary islands originated by inta in spain the project reports it has m in development funding and will use technology from argentina s condor launch vehicle as well as from the us commentary several firms have identified a market opportunity in providing a small launcher for the european market small payloads from european firms or organizations currently use either ariane piggyback launches or the us italian scout launcher however ariane piggyback opportunities are limited and the scout program is being phased out accompanied by some disarray in the italian government and space industry regarding any follow on system this has left an apparent niche for a new european small launch system surprisingly enough esa has not supported development of such a system within the current space funding structure studies have been performed by british aerospace aerospatiale deutsche aerospace and italian organizations but with the exception of the swedish pacastro system reported below i have not been able to find any other european development work with even a rumor of funding for hardware also of interest is the linking of the capricornia to the argentinian condor launcher there have been some interesting rumors surfacing out of argentina over the past year about a space launcher irbm program funded under the military junta which ruled the country in the s and early s what is known is in feb the argentinian air force formally transferred control of the condor missile program to the new civilian argentinian national space agency comison nacional de atividades espaciales cnae the condor program was described as originating in expanding upon the smaller condor rocket program in collaboration with egypt and with support of german firms the condor was also reportedly funded indirectly by iraq in the mid s fairly large solid rocket motors were built and tested but argentinan development of a suitable guidance package lagged that of the propulsion system it should be noted cnae is planning to launch its first scientific satellite in late the us m kg sac b satellite will study the earth s upper atmosphere and includes cooperative experiments from italy and the us no launch vehicle has yet been selected but osc s pegasus and the russian burlak air launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this contract pacastro signs launch reservation with swedish space corp pacastro a small launch firm in herndon virginia announced in late february it had received a m launch reservation contract from the swedish space corp to launch a satellite on pacastro s pa launch vehicle this will be performed as part of the polar satellite service pss a joint norwegian space center swedish space corp program to upgrade the andoya rocket range in norway and offering small satellite launches into the polar regions according to pacastro pss is also performing an m upgrade of the andoya launch facilities including a new integration facility and a fully enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like the pacastro pa pacastro has been chosen as the main alternative rocket supplier for the small satellite launch service to be offered by pss from andoya the date of the launch of the swedish satellite was not specified commentary pacastro has been trying to line up customers and funding for their launch vehicle for some time now the pa is a small two stage rocket fueled by rp and liquid oxygen from pacastro s literature the engines designed for the pa series rockets are built of off the shelf components based upon the lunar module descent engines built by trw and are capable of putting a kg satellite into a km circular polar orbit pacastro is trying to arrange construction financing for its first three pa vehicles with a first launch planned for and orbital launches planned for my records show pacastro hired trw to provide marketing support and systems design with primary engineering to be done by aeroastro a small satellite builder closely associated with pacastro headquartered in the same building the swedish space corporation would supply engineering launch operations vehicle subsystems and marketing support sumitomo corp of tokyo is a first round investor and sits on the board of directors pacastro has gotten a first round financial package of at least k some sources place this of high as m but has been searching for about a year for the additional m needed to design build and launch their first set of vehicles the launch reservation from ssc can possibly be used to help bring some investors on board but by my estimate they will need much more than the single m sale to put their venture into real hardware china and taiwan joint satellite venture reported in early march it was reported a joint satellite communications venture between a taiwanese and mainland chinese was in the works as reported in the taipei press china development corp cdc headquartered in taiwam and with links to the ruling nationalist party is planning to set up a joint venture in hong kong with china great wall industry corp with the objective of launching a regional communications satellite cdc would cover about of the satellite system cost us m in exchange for rights to of the satellite s communications channels commentary this announcement came close on the heels of the release of taiwanese plans for space development released in mid january in those plans the national space program office of taiwan will launch satellites starting with rocsat a kg scientific spacecraft planned for launch in two additional satellites are planned both communications satellites trw has been helping taiwan plan this program budgeted at t b us m through i haven t been able to establish any relationship between this venture and those of the nspot but there might be a connection while taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures the current taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two separate sastellite ventures the reported name for the tiawanese chinese system is asiasat but i don t thinks this has any relationship with the existing hong kong based asiasat program involving chinese hong kong and other asian investors other than using it as an organizational model there are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing venture it could provide excellent first hand experience to taiwan for a very low cost which then can be used in later satellite ventures but there are internal political issues between taiwanese and chinese ventures but putting any joint venture through a hong kong intermediary corporation might allow it to proceed in any case the east asian satellite market is lighting up with substantially growth projected in space services and revenues this is just another indicator to add to the list south korea announces national move into space technologies south korea s trade industry and resources ministry recently announced plans to invest us b in research and development and another us b into manufacturing and research facilities for advanced aerospace technologies space technologies have been specifically targeted as part of this program beginning with manufacture and launch of an advanced multi purpose satellite by the objective of this investment is to raise south korea s aerospace technology to the level of the world s top countries by commentary south korea has been quietly working to develop its national aerospace industry specifically including space activities i m noting this as a flag that potential new players are coming into the commercial space market as part of their national effort national telecommunications satellites for korea telecom will be launched in april and oct on delta designated koreasat and the platforms will provide television and telephone service throughout the korean peninsula southwestern japan and portions of china bordering north korea south korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on ariane in aug called uribyol our star and costing about us m uribyol is planned for piggyback launch in october of this year again on ariane and will be entirely made in korea uribyol projected for a launch will be an environment monitoring micro satellite this satellite may be the precursor to a series of small earth observation satellites the keos korean earth observation system project which has been submitted for approval to the south korean government would use two or three kg spacecraft equipped with optical and microwave sensors south korean press reports claim there is also a parallel military effort to establish the capabilities for building and launching small military satellites by supposedly a government panel had been established to oversee such an effort funded at us m between and in anticipation of an expected pullout of u s intelligence gathering systems from the korean peninsula in conjunction with all of these reported efforts south korean is also pursuing production work either as off sets to existing aerospace technology contracts for example mcdonnell douglas is offsetting production of some delta parts to south korean firms as part of the koreasat launch contracts or for production of consumer space items among other products south korea exports satellite receiver television setups to japan and samsung has announced teaming for production of osc s orbcomm user terminals this looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies considering that east asia is currently the fastest growing sector for commercial space services primarily for telecommunications a south korean push into space technologies may change the composition of commercial space market there over the next decade space technology indexes through march as announced in the last csn sti each issue will give the results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and investments the table below summarizes results to the end of march the space technology index did quite a bit better than the market as a whole as represented by the s p index since of the values included in the index are us firms this represents a general increase in the market value of space related firms the increase in the first quarter is more than in all of which is a very promising sign although future months may reverse this trend the commercial space technology index has also done quite well but the pure play portfolio consisting of stocks of firms which are pure plays in space technologies has also surpassed its results in all of we ll keep an eye on these index results through march beginning beginning jan to mar s p space tech index comm l space tech index space tech pure plays final notes what this column s already full and i still have bunches of commercial space developments to report on as i said at the start of this column there s been a lot of interesting happenings but i ll have to put them into the next issue looking ahead i ve got several articles in the works on new happenings with iridium and the leo communications satellite market more news on international launchers appearing and disappearing on the market new international commercial space ventures and other interesting developments and as always i hope you folks find this stuff useful and interesting any and all comments are welcome wales larrison space

space advertising of two developments have brought these type of activities back to the forefront in first in february the russians deployed a m reflector from a progress vehicle after it had departed from the mir space station while this banner reflector was blank npo energia was very active in reporting that future banner reflectors will be available to advertisers who could use a space based video of their logo or ad printed on the banner in a tv commercial as filmed from the mir the second development has been that space marketing inc the same company responsible for merchandising space on the conestoga booster and comet spacecraft is now pushing the environmental billboard as laid out by smi chief engineer dr ron humble of the university of colorado space laboratory and preston carter of the lawrence livermore national laboratory the environmental billboard is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to x meters advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area deployed by the inflatable frame to help sell the concept the spacecraft responsible for maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry ozone reading sensors to continuously monitor the condition of the earth s delicate protective ozone layer according to mike lawson head of smi furthermore the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum exposure of days it will be released to re enter the earth s atmosphere according to imi as the biodegradable material burns it will release ozone building components that will literally replenish the ozone layer the remaining spacecraft will monitor the atmosphere for another year before it too re enters and burns up and adds to the ozone supply this would not be a cheap advertisement costing at least several millions of dollars exact costs were not available but smi estimates that market exposure would be x that of the people who watched the superbowl where a second advertising unit cost since smi is located in atlanta georgia it is being promoted as being available in time for the opening of the summer olympics in atlanta but back to brian s questions and does anyone have any more details other than what was in the wn news blip how serious is this project is this just in the wild idea stage or does it have real funding see above as for serious if they can get m or so my estimate of for development costs and a flight unit plus m for a launch then it s probably real they are claiming to tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for optimum advertising impact so they probably can t piggy back upon someone else s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated launch that s a m cost they need to raise right there and there will probably be some legal challenges to this as well note there is one potential legal challenge to smi on the use of launch vehicle advertising already while i don t think the legal challenges would win out and yes i am an amateur astronomer and no i don t really like the idea of this additional light pollution but i know of no prohibition of it the legal challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive aspects of the advertising i can imagine several ways to make the advertisers look like louts for doing this which would change positive market exposure to negative market exposure and negate the space advertising advantage would you spend m to look like an idiot and light pollution might not be too bad if it s in a low enough orbit and it relies upon reflected light only it would only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before dawn for maximum market exposure you want to have it visible just after dusk minimizing impact on astronomy since that s the time of worse seeing due to day night thermal turbulence it might still be a problem but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this as for having real funding none that i can identify there were about expressions of interest made on the conestoga advertising opportunity but that included curious folks and was for only a commitment i haven t heard of any serious funding for this but i m sure they are shopping the venture around looking for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more but i am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time and if anybody wants to cross post this to sci astro please be my guest i don t have posting privileges to that area or at least i don t think i do wales larrison space technology investor maximus wb
space advertising of brian yamauchi asks regarding orbital billboards and does anyone have any more details other than what was in the wn news blip how serious is this project is this just in the wild idea stage or does it have real funding well i had been collecting data for next edition of the commercial space news space technology investor to summarize space advertising first advertising on space vehicles is not new it is very common practice to put the cooperating organization s logos on the space launch vehicle for example the latest gps launcher had the very prominent logos on its side of mcdonnell douglas the delta launcher rockwell international who built the gps satellite usaf who paid for the satellite and launch and the gps navstar program office this has not been considered paid advertising but rather public relations since the restrictions have been such that only organizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the side and there was no money exchanged for this however putting a high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras is advertising as much as it is public relations in my opinion and by the way i note that the dc x test vehicle has rather prominent mcdonnell douglas and sdio logos on the side there have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials for use of space vehicles for advertising or placing large advertising signs in orbit on the shuttle for example i know of several serious studies in the early and mid s which looked at putting logos on the external tank or on the sides of the payload bay these ventures would be different than public relations in that the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms participating on that flight and would involve payment of sums for the right to fly the logos in a prominent organization for example painting the et to look like a pepsi can or putting a disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras would scan past it adverts on launch vehicles the first paid advertising was done on a soviet launcher in about when several non involved foreign organizations were allowed to pay to put their logos on a proton launch an italian shoe company was one of the first advertisers i remember similarly soviet cosmonauts on mir made a paid advertisement for the last olympic games and have gleefully shown banners and other items from participating firms and organizations mars candy bars for example got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the british visiting cosmonaut to mir now us firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch vehicles the upcoming conestoga launch in june putting the comet recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements on the side for arnold schwarzenegger s upcoming movie the last action hero besides the usual logos of the participating organizations columbia pictures has paid to put ads on the main fuselage of the mission s conestoga rocket its booster rockets and on the comet payload which will orbit the earth for one month a concept for this advertising display was published in space news magazine a couple of months ago as a side note robert lorsch an advertising executive is talking about suing nasa he charges nasa with appropriating an idea he created with the space agency in to form corporate advertising sponsorships on nasa spacecraft as a way to get funding for the space program lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on the upcoming comet nasa violated an agreement that it would not use his idea without him being the exclusive representative for nasa and receiving compensation this is being disputed since the launch is a commercial launch and nasa is receiving none of the advertising revenues but the funding for the comet program is coming from nasa orbital billboards orbital billboards have been the staple of science fiction for some time arthur c clarke wrote about one example and robert heinlein described another in the man who sold the moon several different potential projects have been developed although none have been implemented but the most real prior to being the eiffel ii project which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in orbit to celebrate the french republic s bi centennial cont maximus wb

re gamma ray bursters where are they in article radsr att access digex net prb access digex com pat writes what evidence indicates that gamma ray bursters are very far away their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution crudely speaking indicates we re seeing an edge to the distribution given the enormous power i was just wondering what if they are quantum black holes or something like that fairly close by why would they have to be at galactic ranges now in the good old days before gro data it was thought the gamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy it was expected that gro would confirm this by either showing they were a local population within a few hundred light years or that they were in the galactic halo mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed also to be fair it was noted that the brightest burster was probably in the lmc suggesting theorists might be wrong back then as the sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo population should show anisotropy a local disk population is ruled out completely at this stage to avoid the anisotropy you have to push the halo out the energy then gets large the mechanism of getting ns out that far becomes questionable and we should start to see for example the andromeda s bursters the data is consistent with either a oort cloud distribution but only just but no one can think of a plausible source with the right spectrum or it can be a cosmological distances hence isotropy and the edge is the edge of the universe if at cosmological distances you need very high energy to detect and a very compact source for spectrum ergo a neutron star colliding with another neutron star or black hole even then getting the spectrum is very hard but conceivable if we know anything about physics at that level the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic strings wrong spectrum for one thing the situation is further complicated by recent claims that there are two classes of sources in the colliding ns they d actually probably fit relatively easily into the ns ns and ns bh collision scenarios respectively my own pet theory is that it s flying saucers entering hyperspace but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes that they are colliding nuetron stars or spinning black holes i just wondered if any mechanism could exist and place them closer in if you can think of one remember to invite me to stockholm steinn sigurdsson lick observatory steinly lick ucsc edu standard disclaimer the laws of gravity are very very strict and you re just bending them for your own benefit b b

larsonian astronomy and physics larsonian astronomy and physics orthodox physicists astronomers and astrophysicists claim to be looking for a unified field theory in which all of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single set of laws or equations but they have been systematically ignoring or suppressing an excellent one for years the late physicist dewey b larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe which he calls the reciprocal system is built on two fundamental postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of space and time the physical universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and in two reciprocal forms space and time the physical universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is euclidean from these two postulates larson developed a complete theoretical universe using various combinations of translational vibrational rotational and vibrational rotational motions the concepts of in ward and out ward scalar motions and speeds in relation to the speed of light which larson called unit velocity and the natural datum at each step in the development larson was able to match objects in his theoretical universe with objects in the real physical universe photons sub atomic particles incomplete atoms charges atoms molecules globular star clusters galaxies binary star systems solar systems white dwarf stars pulsars quasars etc even objects not yet discovered then such as exploding galaxies and gamma ray bursts and applying his theory to his new model of the atom larson was able to precisely and accurately calculate inter atomic distances in crystals and molecules compressibility and thermal expansion of solids and other properties of matter all of this is described in good detail with out fancy complex mathematics in his books books of dewey b larson the following is a complete list of the late physicist dewey b larson s books about his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe some of the early books are out of print now but still available through inter library loan the structure of the physical universe the case against the nuclear atom beyond newton new light on space and time quasars and pulsars nothing but motion a substitute for the billion super collider the last four chapters explain chemical bonding the neglected facts of science the universe of motion final solutions to most all astrophysical mysteries basic properties of matter all but the last of these books were published by north pacific publishers p o box portland or and should be available via inter library loan if your local university or public library doesn t have each of them several of them including the last one are available from the international society of unified science isus e atkin ave salt lake city utah this is the organization that was started to promote larson s theory they have other related publications including the quarterly journal reciprocity physicist dewey b larson s background physicist dewey b larson was a retired engineer chemical or electrical he was about years old when he died in may he had a bachelor of science degree in engineering science from oregon state university he developed his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe while trying to develop a way to compute chemical properties based only on the elements used larson s lack of a fancy ph d degree might be one reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him but it is not a valid reason sometimes it takes a relative outsider to clearly see the forest through the trees at the same time it is clear from his books that he also knew orthodox physics and astronomy as well as any physicist or astronomer well enough to point out all their contradictions ad hoc assumptions principles of impotence in consistencies etc larson did not have the funds etc to experimentally test his theory and it was not necessary for him to do so he simply compared the various parts of his theory with other researchers experimental and observational data and in many cases his explanation fit better a self consistent theory is much more than the orthodox physicists and astronomers have they claim to be looking for a unified field theory that works but have been ignoring one for over years now modern physics does not explain the physical universe so well some parts of some of larson s books are full of quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who agree and remember that epicycles crystal spheres geocentricity flat earth theory etc also once seemed to explain it well but were later proved conceptually wrong prof frank h meyer professor emeritus of uw superior was is a strong proponent of larson s theory and was or still is president of larson s organization the international society of unified science and editor of their quarterly journal reciprocity he moved to minneapolis after retiring super collider boondoggle i am against contruction of the superconducting super collider in texas or anywhere else it would be a gross waste of money and contribute almost nothing of scientific value most physicists don t realize it but according to the comprehensive general unified theory of the late physicist dewey b larson as described in his books the strange goofy particles mesons hyperons alleged quarks etc which they are finding in existing colliders fermi lab cern etc are really just atoms of anti matter which are created by the high energy colliding beams and which quickly disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible with their environment a larger and more expensive collider will only create a few more elements of anti matter that the physicists have not seen there before and the physicists will be even more confused than they are now are a few more types of anti matter atoms worth the billion cost don t we have much more important uses for this wasted money another thing to consider is that the primary proposed location in texas has a serious and growing problem with some kind of fire ants eating the insulation off underground cables how much poisoning of the ground and ground water with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of the supercollider naming the super collider after ronald reagon as proposed is totally absurd if it is built it should be named after a leading particle physicist larsonian anti matter in larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe anti matter is not a simple case of opposite charges of the same types of particles it has more to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the photons of which they are made in relation to the vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light which larson calls unit velocity and the natural datum in larson s theory a positron is actually a particle of matter not anti matter when a positron and electron meet the rotational vibrations charges and rotations of their respective photons of which they are made neutralize each other in larson s theory the anti matter half of the physical universe has three dimensions of time and only one dimension of space and exists in a reciprocal relationship to our material half larsonian relativity the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet mercury has been observed and precisely measured to advance at the rate of seconds of arc per century seconds of this advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational perturbations from the other planets venus earth jupiter etc the remaining seconds of arc are being used to help prove einstein s general theory of relativity but the late physicist dewey b larson achieved results closer to the seconds than general relativity can by instead using special relativity in one or more of his books he applied the lorentz transformation on the high orbital speed of mercury larson totally rejected general relativity as another mathematical fantasy he also rejected most of special relativity including the parts about mass increases near the speed of light and the use of the lorentz transform on doppler shifts those quasars with red shifts greater than really are moving faster than the speed of light although most of that motion is away from us in time in larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe there are three dimensions of time instead of only one but two of those dimensions can not be measured from our material half of the physical universe the one dimension that we can measure is the clock time at low relative speeds the values of the other two dimensions are negligible but at high speeds they become significant and the lorentz transformation must be used as a fudge factor larson often used the term coordinate time when writing about this in regard to mass increases it has been proven in atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near the speed of light but the formula for acceleration is acceleration force mass a f m orthodox physicists are ignoring the third factor force in larson s theory mass stays constant and force drops toward zero force is actually a motion or combinations of motions or relations between motions including inward and outward scalar motions the expansion of the universe for example is an outward scalar motion inherent in the universe and not a result of the so called big bang which is yet another mathematical fantasy the universe of motion i wish to recommend to everyone the book the universe of motion by dewey b larson north pacific publishers p o box portland oregon pages indexed hardcover it contains the astrophysical portions of a general unified theory of the physical universe developed by that author an unrecognized genius more than thirty years ago it contains final solutions to most all astrophysical mysteries including the formation of galaxies binary and multiple star systems and solar systems the true origin of the degree background radiation cosmic rays and gamma ray bursts and the true nature of quasars pulsars white dwarfs exploding galaxies etc it contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are all looking for if they are ready to seriously consider it with open minds the following is an example of his theory s success in his first book in the structure of the physical universe larson predicted the existence of exploding galaxies several years before astronomers started finding them they are a necessary consequence of larson s comprehensive theory and when quasars were discovered he had an immediate related explanation for them also gamma ray bursts astro physicists and astronomers are still scratching their heads about the mysterious gamma ray bursts they were originally thought to originate from neutron stars in the disc of our galaxy but the new gamma ray telescope now in earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions uniformly and their source locations in space do not correspond to any known objects except for a few cases of directional coincidence gamma ray bursts are a necessary consequence of the general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b larson according to page of his book the universe of motion published in the gamma ray bursts are coming from supernova explosions in the anti matter half of the physical universe which larson calls the cosmic sector because of the relationship between the anti matter and material halves of the physical universe and the way they are connected together the gamma ray bursts can pop into our material half anywhere in space seemingly at random this is why the source locations of the bursts do not correspond with known objects and come from all directions uniformly i wonder how close to us in space a source location would have to be for a gamma ray burst to kill all or most life on earth there would be no way to predict one nor to stop it perhaps some of the mass extinctions of the past which are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids were actually caused by nearby gamma ray bursts larsonian binary star formation about half of all the stars in the galaxy in the vicinity of the sun are binary or double but orthodox astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory theory about how they form or why there are so many of them but binary star systems are actually a likely consequence of the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b larson i will try to summarize larsons explanation which is detailed in chapter of his book the universe of motion and in some of his other books first of all according to larson stars do not generate energy by fusion a small fraction comes from slow gravitational collapse the rest results from the complete annihilation of heavy elements heavier than iron each element has a destructive temperature limit the heavier the element is the lower is this limit a star s internal temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays gradually reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and lighter elements when the internal temperature of the star reaches the destructive temperature limit of iron there is a type i supernova explosion this is because there is so much iron present and that is related to the structure of iron atoms and the atom building process which larson explains in some of his books better than i can when the star explodes the lighter material on the outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less than the speed of light the heavier material in the center portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to the speed of light because of the high temperature the explosion pushes that material over the speed of light and it expands outward in time which is equivalent to inward in space and it often actually disappears for a while over long periods of time both masses start to fall back gravitationally the material that had been blown outward in space now starts to form a red giant star the material that had been blown outward in time starts to form a white dwarf star both stars then start moving back toward the main sequence from opposite directions on the h r diagram the chances of the two masses falling back into the exact same location in space making a single lone star again are near zero they will instead form a binary system orbiting each other according to larson a white dwarf star has an inverse density gradient is densest at its surface because the material at its center is most widely dispersed blown outward in time this eliminates the need to resort to mathematical fantasies about degenerate matter neutron stars black holes etc larsonian solar system formation if the mass of the heavy material at the center of the exploding star is relatively small then instead of a single white dwarf star there will be several mini white dwarf stars revolving around the red giant star but probably still too far away in three dimensional time to be affected by its heat etc these will become planets in chapter of the universe of motion larson used all this information and other principles of his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe to derive his own version of bode s law black hole fantasy i heard that physicist stephen w hawking recently completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of two black holes merging together into a single black hole and concluded that the new black hole would have more mass than the sum of the two original black holes such a result should be recognized by everyone as a red flag causing widespread doubt about the whole idea of black holes etc after reading physicist dewey b larson s books about his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe especially his book the universe of motion it is clear to me that black holes are nothing more than mathematical fantasies the strange object at cygnus x is just an unusually massive white dwarf star not the black hole that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want to prove their theory by the way i do not understand why so much publicity is being given to physicist stephen hawking the physicists and astronomers seem to be acting as if hawking s severe physical problem somehow makes him wiser it does not i wish the same attention had been given to physicist dewey b larson while he was still alive widespread publicity and attention should now be given to larson s theory books and organization the international society of unified science electro magnetic propulsion i heard of that concept many years ago in connection with ufo s and unorthodox inventors but i never was able to find out how or why they work or how they are constructed i found a possible clue about why they might work on pages of the book basic properties of matter by the late physicist dewey b larson which describes part of larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe i quote one paragraph as indicated in the preceding chapter the development of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally different concept of the nature of electrical resistance the electrons we find are derived from the environment it was brought out in volume i larson s book nothing but motion that there are physical processes in operation which produce electrons in substantial quantities and that although the motions that constitute these electrons are in many cases absorbed by atomic structures the opportunities for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are limited it follows that there is always a large excess of free electrons in the material sector material half of the universe most of which are uncharged in this uncharged state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension space because they are inherently rotating units of space and the relation of space to space is not motion in open space therefore each uncharged electron remains permanently in the same location with respect to the natural reference system in the manner of a photon in the context of the stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron like the photon is carried outward at the speed of light by the progression of the natural reference system all material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation meanwhile there are other processes to be discussed later whereby electrons are returned to the environment the electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level note that in larson s theory uncharged electrons are also massless and are basically photons of light of a particular frequency above the unit frequency spinning around one axis at a particular rate below the unit rate unit velocity is the speed of light and there are vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light according to larson s theory i might have the above and below labels mixed up larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass less un charged electrons flying around at the speed of light if this is true then the electro magnetic propulsion fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these electrons or other particles in space perhaps giving them a charge and mass and shooting them toward the rear to achieve propulsion in larson s theory an electrical charge is a one dimensional rotational vibration of a particular frequency above the unit frequency superimposed on the rotation of the particle the paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is generated in clouds suppression of larsonian physics the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b larson has been available for more than years published in in his first book the structure of the physical universe it is totally un scientific for hawking wheeler sagan and the other sacred priests of the religion they call science or physics or astronomy etc as well as the scientific literature and the education systems to totally ignore larson s theory has they have larson s theory has excellent explanations for many things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers such as gamma ray bursts and the nature of quasars larson s theory deserves to be honestly and openly discussed in the physics chemistry and astronomy journals in the u s and elsewhere and at least the basic principles of larson s theory should be included in all related courses at uw ec uw madison cambridge cornell university and elsewhere so that students are not kept in the dark about a worthy alternative to the dogma they are being fed for more information answers to your questions etc please consult

re command loss timer re galileo update alan carter writes on april a no op command was sent to reset the command loss timer to hours its planned value during this mission phase this activity is regularly reported in ron s interesting posts could someone explain what the command loss timer is the name is rather descriptive it s a command to the spacecraft that tells it if you don t hear from earth after hours assume something is wrong with your the spacecraft attitude and go into a preprogrammed search mode in an attempt to reacquire the signal from earth the spacecraft and earth are not in constant communication with each other earth monitors the telemetry from the spacecraft and if everything is fine there s no reason to send it any new information but from the spacecraft s point of view no information from earth could mean either everything is fine or that the spacecraft has lost signal acquisition just how long should the spacecraft wait before it decides that something is wrong and begins to take corrective action that how long is the command loss timer during relatively inactive cruise phases the command loss timer can be set to rather long values in this case earth is telling galileo expect to hear back from us sometime within the next hours

does god love you i have come across what i consider to be an excellent tract it is a bit lengthy for a posting but i thought i d share it with all of you anyway feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might benefit from what it says may god richly bless those who read it d o e s g o d l o v e y o u q what kind of question is that anyone who can read sees signs tracts books and bumper stickers that say god loves you isn t that true a it is true that god offers his love to the whole world as we read in one of the most quoted verses in the bible for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life john however god s love is qualified the bible says the way of the wicked is an abomination unto the lord but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness proverbs for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly shall perish psalm q but i am not wicked i am a decent moral person surely the good i have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad i have done how can these verses apply to me a by god s standard of righteousness even the most moral person is looked upon by god as a desperate sinner on his way to hell the bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to heaven on the contrary we are all sinners and we are all guilty before god as it is written there is none righteous no not one there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after god romans the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it jeremiah q if i am such a wicked person in god s sight what will god do to me a the bible teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will come under eternal punishment in a place called hell for a fire is kindled in mine anger and shall burn unto the lowest hell and shall consume the earth with her increase and set on fire the foundations of the mountains i will heap mischiefs upon them i will spend mine arrows upon them they shall be burnt with hunger and devoured with burning heat and with bitter destruction i will also send the teeth of beasts upon them with the poison of serpents of the dust deuteronomy q oh come on now hell is not real is it surely things are not that bad a indeed hell is very real and things are that bad for the individ ual who does not know the lord jesus christ as savior the bible makes many references to hell indicating that it is both eternal and consists of perpetual suffering and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was

shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth matthew when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power thessalonians q that is terrible why would god create a

all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad corinthians but i say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment matthew q does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought to life again to be judged and then to be sent to hell a indeed it does that is unless we can find someone to be our substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal damnation for our sins that someone is god himself who came to earth as jesus christ to bear the wrath of god for all who believe in him all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all isaiah but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed isaiah for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures corinthians for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him corinthians q are you saying that if i trust in christ as my substitute who was already punished for my sins then i will not have to worry about hell anymore a yes this is so if i have believed in christ as my savior then it is as if i have already stood before the judgment throne of god christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him john q but what does it mean to believe on him if i agree with all that the bible says about christ as savior then am i saved from going to hell a believing on christ means a whole lot more than agreeing in our minds with the truths of the bible it means that we hang our whole lives on him it means that we entrust every part of our lives to the truths of the bible it means that we turn away from our sins and serve christ as our lord no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon matthew repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord acts q are you saying that there is no other way to escape hell except through jesus what about all the other religions will their followers also go to hell a yes indeed they cannot escape the fact that god holds us account able for our sins god demands that we pay for our sins other religions cannot provide a substitute to bear the sins of their followers christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and save us neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved acts jesus said i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me john if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness john q now i am desperate i do not want to go to hell what can i do a you must remember that god is the only one who can help you you must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of god as you see your hopeless condition as a sinner cry out to god to save you and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner luke sirs what must i do to be saved and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved acts q but how can i believe on christ if i know so little about him a wonderfully god not only saves us through the lord jesus but he also gives us the faith to believe on him you can pray to god that he will give you faith in jesus christ as your savior for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god ephesians god works particularly through the bible to give us that faith so if you really mean business with god about your salvation you should use every opportunity to hear and study the bible which is the only word of god in this brochure all verses from the bible are within indented paragraphs give heed to them with all your heart so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god romans q but does this mean that i have to surrender everything to god a yes god wants us to come to him in total humility acknowledging our sinfulness and our helplessness trusting totally in him the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart o god thou wilt not despise psalm because we are sinners we love our sins therefore we must begin to pray to god for an intense hatred of our sins and if we sincerely desire salvation we will also begin to turn from our sins as god strengthens us we know that our sins are sending us to hell unto you first god having raised up his son jesus sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities acts q doesn t the bible teach that i must attend church regularly and be baptized will these save me a if possible we should do these things but they will not save us no work of any kind can secure our salvation salvation is god s sovereign gift of grace given according to his mercy and good pleas ure salvation is not of works lest any man should boast ephesians q what else will happen at the end of the world a those who have trusted in jesus as their savior will be transformed into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with christ forever more for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord thessalonians q what will happen to the earth at that time a god will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens and a new earth where christ will reign with his believers forever more but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness peter q does the bible give us any idea of when the end of the earth will come a yes the end will come when christ has saved all whom he plans to save and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come matthew q can we know how close to the end of the world we might be a yes god gives much information in the bible concerning the timing of the history of the world and tells us that while the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved it will not come as a thief for the believers there is much evidence in the bible that the end of the world and the return of christ may be very very close all the time clues in the bible point to this for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape thessalonians surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets amos q but that means judgment day is almost here a yes it does god warned ancient nineveh that he was going to destroy that great city and he gave them forty days warning and jonah began to enter into the city a day s journey and he cried and said yet forty days and nineveh shall be overthrown jonah q what did the people of nineveh do a from the king on down they humbled themselves before god repented of their sins and cried to god for mercy but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth and cry mightily unto god yea let them turn every one from his evil way and from the violence that is in their hands who can tell if god will turn and repent and turn away from his fierce anger that we perish not jonah q did god hear their prayers a yes god saved a great many people of nineveh q can i still cry to god for mercy so that i will not come into judg ment a yes there is still time to become saved even though that time has become very short how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him hebrews in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us psalm a r e y o u r e a d y t o m e e t

tract printed by and available free of charge from family radio a number of minor changes have been made to its layout to facilitate computer printing and distribution the only change to the text itself is the paragraph which describes the way in which biblical passages appear within the text in the original tract they appear in italic lettering they appear here as indented paragraphs i have read mr camping s book compared it with what the bible actual ly says find it to be the most credible research with respect to what the future holds that i have ever come across and agree with him that there is just too much data to ignore while none of us is guaranteed one more second of life and while we therefore should take these matters very seriously regardless of when christ will actually return it would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our eternal destiny until we feel that our death is imminent is even more senseless now because in all likelihood the law of averages with respect to life expectancy no longer applies if you wish to obtain a copy of this book so that you can check out these facts for yourself you may find the following information

quality of catholic liturgy i would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my wife and me lately liturgy in particular catholic liturgy in the last few years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during mass it s driving me crazy the most grace filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is that what happens is something we all do together because we all know how to do it led by the priest of course which makes it a kind of dialogue we present to god but the best masses i ve been to were participatory prayers lately i think the proportion of participation has fallen and the proportion of sitting there and watching or listening or generally being told what to do which is necessary because no one knows what s happening next is growing example last sunday palm sunday we went to the local church usually on palm sunday the congregation participates in reading the passion taking the role of the mob the theology behind this seems profound when we say crucify him we mean it we did it and if he came back today we d do it again it always gives me chills but last week we were invited to sit during the gospel passion and listen besides the orwellian invitation i was really saddened to have my and our little role taken away this seems typical of a shift of participation away from the people and toward the musicians readers and so on new things are introduced in the course of the liturgy and since no one knows what s happening the new things have to be explained and pretty soon instead of doing a lot of the mass we re just sitting there listening or spacing out in my case to how the mass is about to be done in my mind i lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay experts but that may not be just i do think that a liturgy committee has a bias toward doing something rather than nothing that s just a fact of bureaucratic life even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for people to be aware of the lord s presence so we ve been wondering are we the oddballs or is the quality of the mass going down i don t mean that facetiously we go to mass every thursday or friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware of god s presence but as far as the obligatory sunday masses maybe i should just offer it up has anyone else noticed declining congregational participation in catholic masses lately john murray

re revelations in article apr athos rutgers edu topcat tom tredysvr tredydev unisys com tom albrecht writes now as to the suggestion that all prophecy tends to be somewhat cyclical can you elaborate i m not exactly sure what you mean how does the suggestion relate to isaiah s prophecy of the birth of christ by a virgin i don t see any cycles in that prophecy maybe cyclical is not the best word that is one aspect of it in the case of the virgin birth prophecy it applied to the then and there and also prophetically to christ the army that threatened the king would cease to be a threat in a very short time yet it also prophecied of christ several prophecies that refered to christ also had application at the time they were made out of egypt have i called my son refers both to israel and prophetically to christ why do the heathen rage was said of david and also of christ another example would be the scripture quoted of judas and his bishoprick let another take another example is something that isaiah said of his disciples which is also applied to christ in hebrews the children thou hast given me how does the preterist view account for this phenomenon link link hudson

re prophetic warning to new york city in article apr athos rutgers edu evensont spot colorado edu evenson thomas randall writes which brings me around to asking an open question is the bible a closed book of scripture is it okay for us to go around saying god told me this and jesus told me that wouldn t that imply that god is still pouring out new revelation to us i know that some people will feel that is okay and some will not the concept of a closed canon would certainly cast a shadow on contemporary prophets on the other hand an open canon seems to be indicated sometimes there are a lot of people running around saying god told me this and god told me that these days some people really have heard god and others heard their glands mario murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once he said someone told him the lord gave me a song he said that it was the worst song he had ever heard i know why he gave you that song murillo said he didn t want it anymore but god does still speak to his people today and the idea is contrary to the idea of a closed cannon ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the spirit in the church of his day nd and rd century and he was one of the first to put forth a new testament cannon which was almost identical to the one we have today he believed in a closed cannon many prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the scriptures for example one prophet in kings whose name starts with an m who prophecied that the king would lose a battle that is the only prophecy he gave recorded in scripture and we no that he had given other prophecies because the king complained before he heard the prophecy he never prophesies anything good about me yet only one little paragraph of all of his lifetime of prophecies are recorded in scripture there are numerous examples barnabas was a prophet acts says before he was even sent out as an apostle yet his writings are not recorded in scripture only two of agabus prophecies are mentioned in scripture he was already a prophet before he gave them so prophecy may be genuine and from god but that does not make it scripture also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new but rather an inspired translation of scripture is it right to call that prophecy misleading wouldn t that be more having to do with knowledge i don t know about translations of scripture but i am familiar with prophecies that give applications for scripture there are also similar examples in the bible several times peter interprets prophecies in a seemingly prophetic way for example and his bishoprick let another take concerning judas office a clearer example can be found in matthew jesus is prophesying about what will happen before his return and he quotes a passage out of joel about the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood so scriptural prophecy can be used in later prophecy sometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge but gifts of the spirit seem to overlap words of knowledge and wisdom can overlap the word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap interpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy healings are often considered miracles so sometimes the distinction between gifts is a bit hazy imho it doesn t usually matter that much if we are able to label a phenomenon as long as we recognize them as the work of the spirit and use them according to his leading link hudson
re christians and aids in article apr athos rutgers edu marka travis csd harris com mark ashley writes in article apr athos rutgers edu kevin pictel pictel com kevin davis writes many christians believe in abstinence but in a moment will be overcome by desire we all compromise and rationalize poor choices sin last week i was guilty of anger jealousy and whole mess of other stuff yet i am forgiven and not condemned to suffer with aids to even suggest that aids is deserved is ludicrous some rules are made because at some point man is too stupid to know better yet eventually man learns but only after getting a lesson from experience yes it s important to realize that all actions have consequences and that rules were made for our own good but to suggest that a disease is a punishment for certain types of sin i think is taking things much too far if we got some kind of mouth disease for lying would any of us have mouths left what if we developed blindness every time we lusted after someone or something i dare say all of us would be walking into walls i wonder if aids would be a problem now if people didn t get involved in deviant sexual behaviour certainly people who received tainted blood are not to blame but it just goes to show that all mankind is affected by the actions of a few yes sin can have terrible consequences but we need to be real careful when saying that the consequences are a punishment for sin the jews of jesus s time believed that all sickness was the result of a sin then jesus healed a blind man and said that man was blind to show the glory of god not because of sin if aids or any other std is a punishment for sexual sin what do we do with diseases like cancer or multiple sclerosis which are just as debilitating and terrible as aids yet are not usually linked to a specific behavior or lifestyle in addition imho forgiveness is not the end of things there is still the matter of atonement is it aids i don t know atonement is extremely important but i think you ve missed the mark about as far as you can by suggesting that aids is an atonement for sin the atonement for sin is jesus christ period this is the central message of the gospel a perfect sacrifice was required for our sins and was made in the lamb of god his sacrifice atoned for all of our sins past present and future god does not require pennance for our sins nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement he has graciously already done that for us to suggest that aids or some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting on the sacrifice that jesus made in case you couldn t tell i get extremely angry and upset when i see things like this instead of rationalizing our own fears and phobias we need to be reaching out to people with aids and other socially unacceptable diseases whether they got the disease through their own actions or not is irrelevant they still need jesus christ no more and no less than we do i ve said this before but i think it s a good analogy people with aids are modern day lepers jesus healed many lepers he can also heal people with aids maybe not on this earth but in an ultimate sense my next door neighbor has aids she has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed relationship with god her theology isn t what i would want it to be but god s grace covers her the amazing thing is that she is gaining weight she s had the disease for over years and her health is excellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such she attributes her improvement in her health to god s intervention in her life who are we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment it seems to me that god is being glorified through her disease paul overstreet the country singer has a good song title that i think applies to all of us but for the grace of god there go i or something like that may we all experience and accept god s grace mark ashley disclaimer the opinions expressed marka gcx ssd csd harris com here are my own they do not uunet gcx marka reflect the opinion or policies the lost los angelino of harris corporation paul conditt internet conditt titan tsd arlut utexas edu applied research phone fax laboratories fedex burnet road austin texas university of texas postal p o box austin texas austin texas the most wonderful place in texas to live ttttttttttttttt ttt ttt ttt ttt ttttttttttttt texas tech lady raiders tt ttt tt swc champions ttt ncaa national champions ttt ttttttt

questions from a newbie is life a pass fail course and does god grade on a curve i m new here and only vaguely religious but i want to know what some of you people think specifically are there an infinite number of heavens and a person goes to the one that he she deserves or is it simply heaven or nothing hell also are we graded by those around us or has there always been some unchanging method is the person s childhood taken into account i m sure these must sound like over simplifications to most of you but i figure that you re the experts quinn eschatology is an area on which christians do not agree i suspect that s because our primary source of information is prophets and visionaries and their writings tend to be highly symbolic however both jesus teachings in the gospels and books such as the revelation to john talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and eternal death on a number of occasions jesus does say things that imply some sort of differentiation e g lk and a number of similar passages where jesus says things like even xxx will be better off than you in the judgement also i cor talks about someone who gets into heaven but by the skin of his teeth as it were but these passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or hell and not all christians would even go as far as that the only christian group i know of that believes in multiple heavens is the mormons and they are very far from mainstream christianity far enough that many of our readers would not call them christian their ideas in this area involve specific mormon revelations in addition to the bible and holy tradition of a more generic christian sort note that many christians will cringe at the very thought of associating grading with god the whole point of christ was to free us from the results of a test that we couldn t possibly pass if you like test analogies god grades on a very strict and unbending scale but he also cheats he replaces our test papers with an exam that was prepared by the teacher before actually doing the grading because some people end up in heaven and others in hell it s easy to see why you d be inclined to think of it as grading while there are differences among branches of christianity on details i think we all agree that in one way or another god cheats i am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly how far god s cheating extends will he accept people who don t explicitly acknowledge christ but somehow still follow him in their hearts many christians believe that this is possible at least in principle but certainly not all do jesus provided us with a clear description of how to be saved but it s not clear to me that he provided an exact description of how he s going to place the dividing line certainly he made it clear that we can t expect to know whether other individuals are saved or not clh
re prophetic warning to new york city evensont spot colorado edu evenson thomas randall writes yes i suppose it is true that people make mistakes it is interesting to note that in those long ago ot days if you weren t correct in your prophecies people got very mad and you were no longer believed even put to death this is one of the differences between ot prophecy and nt prophecy in the nt it is expected that when believers gather people will prophesy the prophecy must be judged cor there is nothing about killing someone who makes a mistake to say that we make mistakes is true to say that we make mistakes while filled with the spirit is not true were that true the entire bible having been written by men inspired by god would be subject also to those errors for what is prophecy but like those revelations given in scripture scripture is scripture there is no gift of scripture and i don t know about you but i know that i have made mistakes while filled with the spirit if you don t give grace to allow people to make mistakes they will never grow in the use of the spiritual gifts when we minister in my small group i encourage people to speak out any impressions or images they think might be from the lord only by trying will they know whether they were right or wrong and in either case they ll have a better handle on it the next time didn t you fall when you were learning to ride a bicycle but you kept on trying and you learned both from your failures and your successes spiritual gifts are no different you get better with experience which brings me around to asking an open question is the bible a closed book of scripture is it okay for us to go around saying god told me this and jesus told me that wouldn t that imply that god is still pouring out new revelation to us i know that some people will feel that is okay and some will not the concept of a closed canon would certainly cast a shadow on contemporary prophets on the other hand an open canon seems to be indicated sometimes the canon of scripture is complete does this mean that god no longer speaks i have heard his voice not audibly though some have but clearly nonetheless is what i heard equivalent to scripture no i have never heard contemporary prophets claim that what they receive from the lord is on the same level as scripture on the contrary those who are mature obey the scriptures by submitting their prophecies to fellow believers for judgement and the most reliable yardstick for judging prophecies is certainly the scriptures themselves the canon is closed but god is not silent also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new but rather an inspired translation of scripture is it right to call that prophecy misleading wouldn t that be more having to do with knowledge i know the gift of knowledge may not be as exciting to talk about but shouldn t we call a horse a horse does it matter what it is called the question is not how to label it but how to receive it words of knowledge incidentally are similar to prophecy and sometimes the two overlap but generally it is supernatural knowledge of some fact that could not be known otherwise jon reid he is no fool who gives what he cannot keep reid cs uiuc edu to gain what he cannot lose jim elliot
re ancient books i sent in something on this before but i believe it got lost in the weekend accident the moderator described this is an improved version anyway so no loss the first time hl the standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents is probably the writing of friedrich blass hermeneutrik und kritik einleitende und hilfsdisziplinen vol of handbuch der klassischen altertums wissenshaft noerdlingen beck portions of this are described in nibley the prophetic book op mormon pp slc deseret book if you want to attempt reading this be forewarned nibley describes blass as a typical german scholar who claims little knowledge of his subject then proceeds to exhaust both the subject and the reader nibley s extract from blass s work is in the form of rules for forgers it makes interesting reading i confess that i have not read blass s work only nibley s extract thereof my german falls far short of what would be required and as far as i know there is no english translation available however i believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient document and at least determine if it is consistent with what one would expect of a genuine document of that time frame we will not be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to determine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and culture or is a later forgery actually there are types of purportedly ancient documents alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof for example the dead sea scrolls these can be tested by various scientific means to determine the age of the paper inks and objects found with them this can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual physical objects documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the copy itself may be much more recent for example we might find a document which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something from centuries ago perhaps even having been through several generations of copists this is more of a problem but can still be tested although the test is not likely to be simple we cannot expect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so we must confine our testing to the text itself it is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if the document is really what it claims to be they can only date the document and identify its culture of origin for example i ve heard of a letter supposed to have been written by jesus himself to a king in what is now iraq if this document were to actually turn up scholars could date the paper and ink assuming they have the holograph they could check the language content and writing style to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a palestinian jew of that time however even if all test results were positive there is no way to determine if jesus himself actually wrote it we would know what time and culture it came from but barring a known sample of jesus handwriting or other clues for comparison scholarship must stop there there is seldom any way to determine who the actual author was as i say i m no expert on blas s work i do remember some of the tests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works specifically we might ask is the document internally consistent does it contradict itself if the work it is short it would be relatively easy to maintain internal consistency even if it is a forgery the longer the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency for this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents is it consistent with the history and geography of the time again a short non specific work might not be testable but if the writing is of any significant length no latter day forger would be able to escape detection here we look for the minor inconspicuous things which someone from that culture would get right without even thinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous and trivial to check the devil is in the details what about the literary style of the work figures of speech etc any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that seem strange to us are there any such odd phrases in this book if so do they fit in with the culture of course there are complications if the document has been translated or possibly even if somebody just updated language when he copied it a few cases of language not from the culture claimed may be allowed in recent copies they cause problems and reduce certainty to be sure but don t necessarily prove forgery these tests can be quite effective given enough material to work with but they are not easy they require the skills of the historian the linguist the anthropologist etc the questions to ask are is every aspect of this document consistent with what we know about the culture of claimed origin if there are things which don t fit how significant are they are problem areas due to our lack of knowledge later changes by copists or are they really significant there will often be some ambiguity since we never know everything about the culture the end result of any such testing is occasionally certain particularly in the case of holographs or other ancient copies however often it may just be a probability or an indication that the document or maybe parts of it is probably authentic or sometimes maybe other parts are later additions this is often unsettling to a generation raised on tv where all problems are solved in to minutes with time out for commercials it is however the real world and what scholarship has to offer

accepting jeesus in your heart firstly i am an atheist i am not posting here as an immature flame start but rather to express an opinion to my intended audience the meaning of my existence is a question i ask myself daily i live in fear of what will happen when i die i bet some of you are licking your lips now because you think that i m a person on the edge of accepting jeezus i was raised in a religious atmosphere and attended years of religious educational institutions i know the bible well so well i can recognize many passages from memory strong opinions start here the human being is an animal who has due to his her advanced mental facilities developed religious as a satisfiable solution to explain the unexplainable for example the ancient greeks believed that apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real due to the advancement of our technology we know this to be false christianity is an infectious cult the reasons it flourishes are because it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life a safety blanked to hide behind oh wow all i have to do is follow this christian moral standard and i get eternal happiness for all of you found jeezus how many of you were on the brink but i digress the other reason christianity flourishes is its infectious nature a best friend of mine breifly entered a christian group and within months they set ministry guidelines for him which basicaly said this priority spread the word we are just animals we need sleep food and we reproduce and we die religion especially christianity is nothing more than a drug some people use drugs as an escape from reality christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high it pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars of which christianity has had no small part when christians see a non believer they say that person is blind to the truth but they cannot realize that it is they who live with this mask of fakeness each day jesus was just prophet who happened to have a large influence because at that time the romans were circa ad dispersing the jewish population and communities needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need i must go these are but a few of my thoughts on christianity damien endemyr the unpure knight of doom so i ve acquired a taste for blood and have adopted a nocturnal lifestyle that doesnt mean i m a vampire

re post jono mac ak rtsg mot com jon ogden writes my advice is this if you know someone that you have the hots for who is not a christian befriend them and try to develop just a friendship with them at the same time witness and share the gospel with them not so that you can date them but so that they can be saved once they become a christian then it is quite possible to let the relationship progress beyond friendship however if they don t accept christ you still have a good friendship and you haven t wasted a lot of emotional energy and gotten hurt while i agree with most of jon says i deleted those parts of course i have serious reservations about this advice maintaining a just friends level of relationship is much easier said than done people usually end up getting hurt this is especially likely to happen when they start off with feelings of attraction when people feel attracted those feelings can cloud their judgement i ve had the experience of going quickly from believing that i shouldn t date non christians to believing that dating this man would be okay to believing that premarital sex is fine when people really love each other when the relationship ended my beliefs immediately returned to their original state this is an especially extreme case because i was young and away from home and fellowship i don t think it would work exactly this way for most people however it s important not to underestimate the power of feelings of attraction jayne kulikauskas jayne mmalt guild org

weirdness of early christians i am a good catholic boy a convert no less attracted by the rational tradition aquinas et al and the emotional authenticity in comp with the faddishness of anglicanism to roman catholicism i never had much time for the pope or any other heirarchs but i did and do believe in the sacremental system i always felt quite happy to look down my nose at those such as john emery a few posts back who had to engage in circuitous textual arguments to prove their faith entirely oblivious to the fact that a dozen other faiths can do the same with miracles too and that since their arguments depend on the belief in the bible as god s sole revelation it was not very good logic to argue that the bible proved god no i was happy to accept the church as god s revelation it was the church after all that existed before the bible the church that choose under grace of course the canon of scripture protestant ludicrosity i thought was shown by protestants breathtaking acceptance of luther s right to reject a dozen or so books he disliked but recently i read peter brown s body and society it is very well researched and well written but is raises some very upsetting questions the early christians were weird even more so than today s carzy fundies they had odd views on sex odder views on the body totally ludicrous views about demons and distinctly uncharitable views about other human beings now the question is this were the first christians just as weird but we ve got used to them or did the pristine fall of the church happen within one generation it certainly did nt have to wait until the triumph of the church under constantine if so wha does this say about god s promise to always support the church it s no use throwing the usual protestant pieties about the church not being an organization at me it s a community or it is nothing and it was the early communities that were weird the institional church was a model of sanity by comparison i would be interested in serious catholic and orthodox responses to this entirely serious issue i m not sure it is an issue for protestants with their soul alone with jesus approach but for we who see the ecclesia as a koinoia over time and space the weird early christians are a problem this is an exaggeration of the protestant view many protestants have a strong appreciation for the role of the church the soul alone with god is certainly important for protestants but it s by no means the whole story i have read the sort of history you talk about as you point out protestants don t have quite the same problem you do because we believe that the church had a fall at some point however protestant mythology typically places the fall around the time of constantine or more likely regard it as happening in a sort of cumulative fashion starting from constantine but getting worse as the pope accumulated power during the medieval period the consequences of having it earlier are somewhat worrisome even to us most protestants accept the theological results of the early ecumenical councils including such items as the trinity and incarnation indeed in the works of reformers such as luther and calvin you ll find church fathers such as augustine quoted all the time i think you ll find many protestants resistant to the idea that the early church as a whole was wierd there is an additional problem for protestants that i don t much want to talk about in this context since it s been looked at recently that s the question of whether one can really think of augustine and other fathers as being proto protestants their views on mary the authority of the pope etc are not entirely congenial to protestant thought one thing that somewhat worries me is a question of methodology there are certainly plenty of wierd people in the early church what concerns me is that they may be overrepresented in what we see we see every christian who courted martyrdom but i think there s good reason to believe that most ordinary christians were more prudent than that we see the heroic virgins but i think there s good reason to think that many christians were happily married i can t help suspecting that the early church had the same range of wierdos and sane people that we do now i think there s also a certain level of revisionism active in history at the moment i don t mean that they re manufacturing things out of whole cloth but don t you think there might be a tendency to emphasize the novel clh
re hell quoth the moderator i have to say that i some qualms about giving you this explanation because it raises additional problems if god is the source of all existence then a complete separation from him would make existence itself impossible so does god maintain just enough connection with those who are rejected to keep them in existence so he can punish them in a short poem god in his mercy made the fixed pains of hell c s lewis expresses an idea that i m sure was current among others but i haven t be able to find its source that even hell is an expression of mercy because god limits the amount of separation from him and hence the amount of agony that one can achieve michael a covington internet mcovingt ai uga edu artificial intelligence programs phone the university of georgia fax athens georgia u s a amateur radio n tmi

re quality of catholic liturgy in apr athos rutgers edu jemurray magnus acs ohio state edu john e murray writes i would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my wife and me lately liturgy in particular catholic liturgy in the last few years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during mass it s driving me crazy the most grace filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is that what happens is something we all do together because we all know how to do it led by the priest of course which makes it a kind of dialogue we present to god but the best masses i ve been to were participatory prayers having lived through the kicking and screaming in the s and s as the catholics were invited to participate in the liturgy instead of counting their rosary beads during mass i find this comment interesting there is a massively longer tradition for proclaiming the passion accounts without active participation if you know the latin one really beautiful way to hear the passion is it s being chanted by three deacons the narrator chants in the middle baritone range jesus chants in the bass and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor this is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the passion that john would prefer but there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations each pastor makes his own decisions it isn t a church wide conspiracy against participation the palm sunday liturgy with its initial blessing and distribution of the palms and procession is already getting long before you get to the passion some pastors feel that they should not make the people stand through that long narrative also the orchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation in the crowd quotations runs longer than the single reader proclamation in churches with multiple masses for the sunday it might be necessary to go with the briefer options just to get em in and get em out each parish is different catholics are no longer canonically tied to their geographic parishes it is possible that another catholic parish in the columbus area based on the ohio state address has a liturgy closer to your preferences or talk to some of your fellow parishioners and see how common your preferences are pastors generally are willing to listen to non confrontational requests though you probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly to the shock of people asked for a longer sunday mass perhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn t follow the continuous evolution model the accumulation of small changes no single one of which is too hard to take but rather the punctuated equilibrium model things stay the same and we get accustomed to them then the marked mutation hits my apologies if i am mis remembering the names of the evolutionary theories tim rolfe rolfe dsuvax dsu edu rolfe junior dsu edu rolfet columbia dsu edu

re christians and aids paul conditt writes yes it s important to realize that all actions have consequences and that rules were made for our own good but to suggest that a disease is a punishment for certain types of sin i think is taking things much too far text deleted yes sin can have terrible consequences but we need to be real careful when saying that the consequences are a punishment for sin i wish that you had followed this thread before jumping to conclusions i haven t seen anybody write that aids was a punishment for certain types of sin this includes mark ashley who you were responding to here i myself wrote that when you don t do things god s way that curses will come on you and others although one definition of curse is retribution i only meant harm or misfortune when i used the word because god loves us he has told us the best way to live in his bible god doesn t cause curses he warns us of them kevin davis wrote a while ago last week i was guilty of anger jealousy and whole mess of other stuff yet i am forgiven and not condemned to suffer with aids to even suggest that aids is deserved is ludicrous the bible makes it clear that we all equally deserve death which is much worse than aids we have all hurt god with our sin paul conditt reveals his feelings in case you couldn t tell i get extremely angry and upset when i see things like this instead of rationalizing our own fears and phobias we need to be reaching out to people with aids and other socially unacceptable diseases whether they got the disease through their own actions or not is irrelevant they still need jesus the first issue you bring up is your anger it is obvious ly wrong to be angry gal for any reason especially extremely angry which is on par with hatred jesus has every reason to be angry at us for putting him on the cross with our sin yet his prayer was forgive them father they know not what they do knowing how forgiving jesus has been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out of love for him please don t give in to anger it will only cause foolish quarrels and more bad feelings it s okay if you read something that bothers you but you need to address it in a loving way if right now i felt like someone out there was saying that god punishes gay or sexually immoral people with aids because they deserve punishment that others don t then i would frame a response something like this it makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that aids which is simply a harmful disease not so unlike any other is god s punishment for people who have committed certain sins god loves all of his children equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him we will all be judged after we die but until then we all have the opportunity to accept god s grace by earnestly seeking after him with all of our hearts believing the gospel s testimony repenting of our sin confessing that jesus is lord at baptism and living a new life for him let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned god s arm is not to short to save he will do anything he can to move a hardened heart or a misled person he works for the good of all men even through the worst of situations he has set the times and places for all men that they may perhaps reach out and find him the second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fears of people with aids fortunately what you describe as seeing is actually misperceiving you have been missing the points made in the earlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven t been expressed i know that its sometimes hard to discount your perceptions but please try to be open minded you are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all people because they all need jesus this is what my brothers and sisters and i do on a daily basis if you would like to send me the name of the city and state you live in i will find and get you in touch with some brothers who have aids or know people with aids and live nearby you so that you can see the loving attitudes for yourself the third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual contracted aids how someone gets aids is only relevant to their salvation in that there may be repetence involved the important point to be made however is that not listening to god s commands or advice or warnings i e sinning causes harm or misfortune to yourself and others for this reason a good way to prevent the misfortune of aids which can be transmitted in sinful ways is to listen to god s advice and have sex only with your wife or husband i hope that you are feeling better now paul love aaron cardenas

re reason vs revelation in article apr athos rutgers edu trajan stephen mcintyre writes in article apr athos rutgers edu writes i can only reply with what it says in timothy i m not here to discount parts of the bible rather i m here only to discount the notion of revelation the author of timothy told what he thought was the truth based on his belief in god his faith in jesus as the resurrected son and his readings of the old testament but again what had been revealed to him was based on at best second hand information given by friends and authors who may not have given the whole truth or who may have exaggerated a bit first of all the original poster misquoted the reference is from tim the author was paul and his revelations were anything but at best second hand and is came about that as saul journeyed he was approaching damascus and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him and he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him saul saul why are you persecuting me and he said who art thou lord and he said i am jesus whom you are persecuting acts nas paul received revelation directly from the risen jesus pretty cool eh he became closely involved with the early church the leaders of which were followers of jesus throughout his ministry on earth now you may say the holy spirit revealed these things unto him and we could go into that argument but you d be hard pressed to convince me that the holy spirit exists i agree i don t believe anyone but the spirit would be able to convince you the spirit exists please don t complain about this being circular i know it is but really can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural this is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the bible additionally what he has written is again second hand info if it were given by the spirit and still carries the chance it is not true the spirit is part of god how much closer to the source can you get the greek in timothy which is sometimes translated as inspired by god literally means god breathed in other words god spoke the actual words into the scriptures many theologians and bible scholars dr james boice is one that i can remember off hand get quite annoyed by the dryness and incompleteness of inspired by god the only way you would be able to escape this notion of second hand info is to have had the entire bible written by god himself and to tell the truth i ve studied the bible extensively and have yet to hear of scholars who have put forth objective evidence showing god as the first author of this collection of books that s what the verse taken from timothy was all about the continuity of a book written over a span of years by more than authors from all walks of life is a testimony to the single authorship of god and as for reason read what it says in corinthians about human wisdom basically it says that human wisdom is useless when compared with what god has written for our learning if you knew of jesus as well as you know the bible you d realize he reasoned out the law and the prophets for the common man what source to you claim to have discovered which has information of superior historicity to the bible certainly not josephus writings or the writings of the gnostics which were third century at the earliest and though some claim jesus was he was human with all of the human wisdom the apostle paul set out to criticize yet would you not embrace the idea that jesus was wise jesus was fully god as well that s why i d assert that he is wise i realise that you may not accept the authority of the bible this is unfortunate to say the least because there is no other way of learning about god and christ and god s purpose with the earth than reading the bible and searching out its truth for yourself for your information i was raised without any knowledge of god by the time some of the faithful came to show me the word and share with me its truth i was living happily and morally without acknowledging the existence of a supreme being i have though read the bible several times over in its entirety and have studied it thoroughly it contains truth in it and i consider jesus to be one of the most moral of human beings to have lived in fact i darn near idolize the guy but there s no rational reason for me to except god s existence please rethink this last paragraph if there is no god which seems to be your current belief then jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not only did he assert that god exists but he claimed to be god himself regards to c s lewis how then could you have the least bit of respect for jesus in conclusion be careful about logically unfounded hypotheses based on gut feelings about the text and other scholars unsubstantiated claims the bible pleads that we take it in its entirety or throw the whole book out about your reading of the bible not only does the spirit inspire the writers but he guides the reader as well we cannot understand it in the least

re revelations he doesn t contradict himself the church is to last for all time however there are those who use the church to bolster themselves this is evident in many letters for instance paul talks about the super apostles to the corinthians corinthians he mentions how people will be led away by miracles signs and wonders thessalonians he tells timothy that it is clear that some will abandon the faith and teach lies timothy and that some will search for teachers to suit what they want to hear timothy such passages go throughout the letters and jesus does warn about them matthew but look at the promise in this last part verse and this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations and then the end will come even today there are false teachings i can name two which i am well familiar with the non need of baptism and the praying of jesus into your life for salvation both are taught both are dead wrong they have been taken out of context from some verses interpreted from others and just plain made up the only way jesus taught is given in luke and luke he then commands baptism in matthew the church jesus founded though is alive and well it s not being persecuted as much as back then the laws won t allow it yet but it is being persecuted joe fisher peace lou lou nunez e mail lnunez vaxa stevens tech edu ps ps dn ml ad altare dei ad deum qui laetificat juventutem meam cor mt cor luke

re unity in article apr athos rutgers edu maarten van loon cwi nl maarten van loon writes hello fellow netters and fellow christians about the subject of unity between christians and christian churches to a bible study group alltough i do have a personal opinion on this issue i thought it would be nice to hear opinions of fellow christian brothers and sisters from different countries and in different situations my background member of a orthodox reformed church let us say a little the only unity i ve found which is true is when all parties involved are disciples i came out of a church in which even the different congregations were always competing and arguing about which one was better and who had the better messages while none of them put anything into practice from those messages since becoming a disciple i ve found that when i travel to another church in the same movement they are just as accepting there as any other we had a retreat back in january when some of the congregation from louisville ky came up this retreat was for college students and it was as though i had known even the people from louisville for years and i had only become a disciple the previous april and had never been to the church in kentucky one of the keys to unity is unselfish love and self sacrifice that is only one area in which disciples stand out from christians also another part of unity is a common depth of conviction i ve also been a part of some christian campus fellowships who were focused on unity between churches and saw that those churches had one thing involved a lack of conviction about everything they believed that was why they could be unified they didn t care about the truth but delighted in getting along together the problem here in the netherlands is that there are two other churches denominations with the same characteristics both have the same confessions there are only some differences with respect to for example the matter of appropriation of salvation and how to use our creeds in essence a lot of people of these three churches have to same faith and feel that they should become one church but how that is the question creeds what need is there of creeds when the bible stands firmly better so here is a first question can the congregation of christ be separated by walls of different denominations or is this definitely an untolerable situation according to the scriptures according to the scriptures splits and differences of opinion are going to be there as per a previous note i mentioned that there are those who teach falsely by many means there are also differences of opinion and belief however scripture states in the following directives i have no praise for you for your meetings do more harm than good in the first place i hear that when you come together as a church there re divisions among you and to some extent i believe it no doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have god s approval corinthians how will god show his approval by fruitfulness see acts but before that there are these qualities devotion to the apostles teaching fellowship communion filling with awe for god all having everything in common glad and sincere hearts praising god enjoying the favor of the people all these are mentioned in acts god also shows that those who have these qualities are persecuted look at stephen a man full of faith and of the holy spirit acts who was later stoned acts can one say that only one of these three churches is the true church of jesus christ one can say that a church is the true church only if that church is perfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement i have yet to find that but the closest one i ve found is the boston church of christ movement which constantly strives to have errors pointed out and corrected it is also the only one i ve seen which is totally sold out to god a problem closely related to these question is can we cooperate with other christians from these two churches before there is a unity this question is especially important for those who think that only one church can be the true one as for cooperation that can always occur unity on the other hand may never occur as for those who think about only one church being the true one i remind them that mark states that there are disciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with but they will not lose their reward as with the boston movement i ve heard numerous times this exact same thing that there are disciples out there that are not a part of the boston movement but that does not make them any less disciples of course few people admit that they ve ever run into someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement i know i haven t maybe this last problem sounds a little strange to most of you for your information we have a lot of organizations here which are founded by people of one specific church and whose members are all members of that church this has been considered as correct for years only a few years ago people started to discuss about this and now we are in the middle of this process some organizations are opening their doors for people from other churches etc i must warn that this sounds cliquey to me a clique is a group which runs around together to some extent exclusively this causes problems in fellowship and causes divisions i would not say at all that this is something correct for a church group to do for any reason in one of the churches i attended for example there was an internal clique of people who were on the different groups committees organizational heads of the congregation they rarely talked to anyone else outside of the committees and seldom were voted out of office without another office being opened up so that they would have to step right back in their degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came he nearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch i wish he would ve

re weirdness of early christians were the early christians weird yes so were their non christian contemporaries the more familiar you are with late republican rome or the pricipate the weirder those people will seem forget the creative filtering done by renaissance and eighteenth century hero worship so are modern non christians and christians you are pretty weird yourself with your rather acid dismissal of luther and of protestantism and in apparently buying into a simplistic propaganda model about catholicism not being faddish sure it s so large that global fads take longer cycles than they do in smaller denominations and local ones are not usually visible unless you do a lot of traveling to exotic lands may i recom mend as a salutary antidote to this nonsense philippe aries book the hour of our death a longitudinal study of death customs in western specifically catholic christendom and it won t help to escape into the obscurity of the first christian century paul was pretty weird too as were peter and the others in the apparently quite weird circle around jesus what i think you might find helpful is a bit more charity try to understand these weirdos and nutcases with the same respect and love you would expect others to show your notions we are commanded to love one another after all and brown s book is in fact a heroic attempt to see the groupings he talks about as motivated in love and the gospel and their social contexts if anything brown is too heroic here he manages to overstrain himself at times i don t suggest that we follow any of these old cult paths and it raises hard questions from the skeptic inside me that so much of early christianity was like the weird christian and non christian cults we see today to that extent i think you raise a serious problem and perhaps your phrasing is implicitly self deprecatory and ironic but the first principle for answering these questions is respect and love for those we do not understand and it helps to work at under standing as long as we do not get overwhelmed by revulsion and begin to withdraw our respect for them as people i would advise in other words more historical reading brown s other books are also good most especially his bio of augustine also try robin lane fox s christians and pagans maybe the paul veyne ed history of private life some of foucault s books on sexuality in the ancient world humanity is weird we have known one sane person and we killed him fortunately for us this has proved a comedy rather than a tragedy easter yes this is a tad early our vigil service here has been moved forward because so many churches in the area have taken to doing their own vigils and the seminarians must therefore worship and run if they are to do it here and there as well think of this as an anglican fad michael l siemon we must know the truth and we must mls ulysses att com love the truth we know and we must or act according to the measure of our love mls panix com thomas merton

pantheism environmentalism apr susan harwood kaczmarczik writes to all we suspect that s because one party to the environmental dispute thinks the earth is sanctified it s clear that much of the environmentalist energy is derived from what has been called the religious left a secular or even pagan fanaticism that now worships such gods as nature and gender with a reverence formerly accorded real religions emphasis mine shk first of all secular and pagan are not synonyms pagan which is shk derived from the latin paganus means of the country it is in shk fact a cognate with the italian paisano which means peasant shk paganism among other things includes a reverence for the planet and shk all life on the planet stemming from the belief that all life is shk interconnected so rather than be something secular it is something shk very sacred i would go further and say that much of the damage to the environment has been caused by the secular worldview or by the humanist worldview and especially by the secular humanist worldview this is not to say that all secular humanists are necessarily avid destroyers of the environment and i am sure that there are many who are concerned about the environment but at the time of the renaissance and ref ormation in western europe man became the centre or the focus of culture hence humanism this consciousness was also secular in the sense that it was concerned primarily with the present age r ather than the age to come capitalism arose at the same time and the power of economics became central in philosophy this doesn t mean that economics did not exist before simply that it began to dominate the conscious cultural values of western european society and its offshoots this cultural shift was in its later stages accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that justified them there was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of economics from the christian view of man as the economos the steward of creation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces and powers there were denominational differences among the new worshippers of mammon for some the name of the deity was the free rein of the market mechanism while for others it was the dialectical forces of history but in both the capitalist west and the socialist east the environment was sacrificed on the altar of mammon the situation was mitigated in the west because thos e who were concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom to oppose what was happening and state their case steve golded
re ancient books cobb alexia lis uiuc edu mike cobb writes if i talk with an atheist and tell him the new testament is an historically reliable document what reasons would i give him i have found that this isn t a very effective argument most atheists are perfectly willing to acknowledge the existence and ministry of jesus but are quite capable of rationalizing the miracles and the resurrection into misunderstandings hoaxes or simple fabrications they can always make an analogy with the iliad a book that tells the story of the historical trojan war but also talks about gods and goddesses and their conversations i don t think it s possible to convince atheists of the validity of christianity through argument we have to help foster faith and an understanding of god i could be wrong are there any former atheists here who were led to christianity by argument alan terlep incestuous vituperousness oakland university rochester mi atterlep vela acs oakland edu melissa eggertsen rushing in where angels fear to tread

re prayer in jesus name in article apr athos rutgers edu munns cae wisc edu scott munns writes i am doing a dormitory bible discussion with my christian roommate and in jesus name what about the people before jesus they prayed to god and he listened then in spite of their sins why can t it be the same way now insert huge deletion of all following material since it had little relevance to what i ve found ok the people before jesus didn t have jesus right so far i ve announced that space is a vacuum the people who lived during the time jesus lived especially disciples were taught this i tell you the truth anyone who has faith in me will do what i have been doing he will do even greater things than these because i am going to the father and i will do whatever you ask in my name so that the son may bring glory to the father you may ask me for anything in my name and i will do it john so jesus asked them to pray for things in his name since that time the request has been the same not to ask for intercession from other beings but from jesus remember that there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus who gave himself as a ransom for all men the testimony given in its proper time timothy also there have been many of those priests talking about priests among the hebrews since death prevented them from continuing in office but because jesus lives forever he has a permanent priesthood therefore he is able to save completely those who come to god through him because he always lives to intercede for them hebrews hebrews is also full of areas talking about jesus being our mediator rather than any other man joe fisher the people before jesus didn t have jesus right may not be as obvious as you think in what sense to you mean didn t have christian thought has generally said that they had jesus in the sense that they were saved by his death god is not bound by our chronology so in some real spiritual sense they did have jesus even in terms of knowledge while they surely didn t have the explicit knowledge that we have christians have normally seen messianic prophecy as knowledge of jesus even if knowledge from afar clh
the empty tomb the empty tomb can we trust it by the late wilbur m smith d d when jesus was on earth he made an amazing prediction about himself and frequently repeated it let me quote it for you behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify him and the third day he shall rise again matthew wholly different from the normal experience of men jesus who had never done anything worthy of death even deserving reproval knew he would die before he was years of age he knew the very city where he would die he knew that the religious leaders of his own race would condemn him to death he knew that one of his own would betray him he knew that before his actual death took place he would be mocked and scourged he knew exactly how he would die by crucifixion all this is in itself remarkable but more amazing than the minute particulars of his foreknowledge was what he predicted would follow shortly after he was buried that he would rise again he even designated the time on the third day but since it is on this central fact the death and resurrec tion of jesus christ that the whole truth or untruth of chris tianity turns let us examine it more closely the body of jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and ointments was distributed the body was placed in a tomb which had never before been used and a great stone was rolled against the entrance the jewish authorities fully aware that jesus had predicted he would rise again had the stone officially sealed and on saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the disciples from carrying away the body early sunday morning some of the women who were faithful followers of christ went out to the tomb to further anoint the body to their utter astonishment they found the stone rolled away the body gone they rushed back to tell the disciples shortly two of jesus friends peter and john utterly skeptical about the whole affair came and found the tomb empty just as the women had said even the guards came hurrying into the city to tell the sanhedrin that had hired them to guard the tomb that the body was gone matthew how did this tomb become empty one of the most famous new testament scholars in america professor of new testament literature in a large theological seminary wrote to the author in answer to my question of how the tomb became empty and wrote it in a letter not marked by bitterness or sarcasm that he could no more explain how the tomb became empty than he could explain how santa claus comes down the chimney at christmas time but he didn t realize that santa clause never did come down any chimney at christmas time because there never was a santa claus and there is a jesus he died he was buried in the tomb of joseph of arimathea and on sunday the body was gone those are facts of history no one can escape the responsi bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old another professor dr kirsopp lake of harvard university tried to explain the empty tomb by saying what no other scholar in the field of new testament criticism has ventured to adopt that the women went to the wrong tomb the facts are these first so far as we know there was no other tomb nearby to which by mistake they could have gone second it is contrary to all similar experience for three or more people to forget the place where they have buried their dearest loved one within less than three days even if the women did miss the tomb when peter and john came did they too go to the wrong tomb third were the soldiers guarding the wrong tomb there is of course a record of an attempt to escape the evidence of the empty tomb in the new testament itself now when they were going behold some of the watch came into the city and showed unto the chief priests all the things that were done and when they were assembled with the leaders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers saying say ye his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept and if this come to the governor s ears we will persuade him and secure you so they took the money and did as they were taught and this saying is com monly reported among the jews until this day matthew this is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the fact that the tomb was empty you will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never questioned but that the tomb was empty they never even went out to see if what the guards had reported was true they knew it was true another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that the tomb was empty the soldiers were told to say that jesus disciples came and stole the body away while they the soldiers were asleep how could they know what was going on while they were asleep obviously such testimony would be valueless in any court even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject the explanation the very character and the later history of the disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away the body of jesus first as professor heffern points out the leaders of judaism in jerusalem who had put the lord jesus to death had nothing to offer to contradict these disciples as they continued to preach jesus and his resurrection because all jerusalem knew the tomb was empty if there had been trickery here sooner or later it would have been suspected then proved second surely one of the disciples even most of them would have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent it may be possible to live a lie but men seldom die for a lie and most of these men did the result ultimately would have been that the message that christ had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories it would have lost it power instead this truth swept the world closed pagan temples won millions of disciples brought hope to a despairing humanity was the very foundation truth of the early church and is today as believable and as freshly glorious as ever but not only did jesus come alive again he did not disappear to leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to what had happened to him instead he appeared to them literally visibly frequently he appeared to the women at the tomb on resurrection morning matthew later that day to mary magdalene alone john and to simon peter also alone luke in the afternoon he walked with two of his followers toward emmaus luke and that night he appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper room at jerusalem mark luke etc a week later he appeared to all eleven of the apostles probably at the same place john once he was seen by above brethren on a mountain in galilee i corinthians and finally to the apostles just before his ascension mark luke acts as with the fact of the empty tomb so in regard to these histor ically recorded appearances all kinds of theories have been proposed attempting to deny their literalness but these theories are unreasonable without supporting evidence none has ever won the unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the appearances moreover while it is true we are living in an age when may of our leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are antisuperanaturalistic let us not forget that some of the greatest thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle increase mather president of harvard timothy dwight president of yale nathan lord president of dartmouth edward hitchcock president of amherst mark hopkins president of williams john witherspoon president of princeton these men and countless others have believed it but suppose christ did rise from the dead what of it what has it to do with my life what has it to do with your life just this it seals with certitude the teachings of christ jesus taught many great truths especially many about himself he claimed to have come down from god he said he was the way to god he said he was the son of god who alone knew god perfectly he said that whoever believed on him had eternal life and no one else had it he said that whatever we ask god in his name he would grant it to us thus when he did rise from the grave on the third day he revealed that in these amazing unparalleled predictions he spoke the truth do you know any reason any good reason why we should not believe that his words are all true the point is does not the truth of the resurrection convince us that he is none other than the one he claimed to be the son of god and then of course the fact that christ rose from the dead testifies that he has broken the power of death and that he will some day raise us also up from the grave as he promised in other words if this person jesus christ the son of god in all this he should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life for he said a life built on him would know forgiveness of sins his compan ionship and help a joy that no circumstances can ever take away and a hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day those who have tried it down through the ages and there have been many have given their testimony and we today who believe also know
re old vs new testament rexlex fnal fnal gov writes we can jillustrate this by pointing to the way god administers his judgment in the ot sins were not forgiven but rather covered up in the age of the church not only are sins forgiven taken away but the power of sin is put to death my this distinction seems quite arbitrary blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven whose sin is covered ps and quoted by the apostle paul even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin rom the biblical perspective seems to be that foregiveness and covering are parallel equivalent concepts in both testaments the dispensational distinction is unwarranted during the millenium we read that sins are dealt with immediately under the present ie that christ is present on earth rulership of christ i m sure rex has scripture to back this up you re suggesting jesus is going to travel around dealing with individual violations of his law for millions perhaps billions of people such activity for moses the lawgiver was considered unwise cf ex ff it makes for interesting speculation though i ll leave comments on the so called bema seat vs throne judgments to someone else this also seems like more unnecessary divisions ala dispensationalism tom albrecht

re the arrogance of christians i d like to share my thoughts on this topic of arrogance of christians and look forward to any responses in my encounters with christians i find myself dismayed by their belief that their faith is total truth according to them their beliefs come from the bible and the bible is the word of god and god is truth thus they know the truth this stance makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own hesitations about christianity because they see no other way their way is the truth but i see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe a particular way that choice is part faith and part reason but it seems to me a choice my discussions with some christians remind me of schoolyard discussions when i was in grade school a kid would say all policemen are jerks i d ask how do you know because my daddy told me so how do you know you re daddy is right he says he s always right well the argument usually stops right there in the end aren t we all just kids groping for the truth if so do we have the authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as false this is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup i apologize if i m covering tired old ground some of the discussions on this topic have piqued my interest and i welcome any comments louis j kim o ph southwest research institute fax post office drawer lkim swri edu san antonio tx compuserve com i m sort of mystified about how a christian might respond to this i can understand criticisms of christianity that say there s not enough evidence to believe it or that there s just as good evidence for other religions i don t agree but clearly there are plenty of intelligent people who don t find the evidence convincing but that doesn t seem to be your point rather you seem upset that people who believe christianity is true also believe that things which contradict it are false this suggests a model of spiritual things that s rather different than the christian one it sounds more like an existentialist view where people choose what value to follow but there s no actual independent spiritual reality and so no way to say that a specific choice is in some unique sense right this sort of model with modifications of one sort or another may be appropriate for some religions but christianity is in its essense a historical religion that is it s based on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out there that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways and that we see evidence of that in history in the mundane world we are not free to choose how things work when we drop something it falls aside from well defined situations where it doesn t the christian concept is that spiritual matters there is also an actual external reality i hope we re all honest enough not to claim that we have perfect understanding but while we may not think we know everything we are confident that we know some things and that implies that we think things that contradict them are false i don t see how else we could proceed this needn t result in arrogance i m certainly interested in talking with people of other religions they may have things to teach me and even if they don t i respect them as fellow human beings but it s got to be possible to respect people and also think that on some matters they are wrong maybe even disasterously wrong clh

ethics vs freedom being a parent in need of some help i ask that you bear with me while i describe the situation which plagues me i am a divorced father chance would have it that my weekend with my daughter has fallen upon easter weekend this year although i am presbyterian i had married a catholic woman we decided that the catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith was too confining and restrictive due to time as we had already set a date and we were married in a christian church which was non denominational during the years of our marriage we did not often attend church when our daughter was born some years later my wife insisted that she be baptised as catholic this wasn t a problem with me during a separation of five years my ex wife was taken ill with a disease that affected her mental capacities she was confined to a mental ward for two months before it was diagnosed it has since been treated effectively in other words professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society during the recuperation my ex wife has embraced buddism her influence over my daughter has been substantial and has primarily allowed me only saturday visitation for a number of years during this period i have read bible study books to my daughter and tried to keep her aware of her christian heritage last fall our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings at that time i was awarded visitation rights every other weekend at that time i started taking my daughter to church quite often although not every weekend i did this to attempt to strengthen the christian ethic and expose her to a religious community today easter sunday i took my daughter to church when it came time for communion my daughter took the bread the body of christ but left the wine the blood of christ professing that she was too young for wine she then balled the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the pew in front of us i feel this was a slap in the face to me my religion and an afront to her religious heritage it can be construed as breaking several of the commandments if you try i really felt dishonored by the action my daughter is only nine years old but i think she should have been old and mature enough to realize her actions i have difficulty blaming her directly for religious teachings her mother swears to but when i discussed this with my daughter she made it clear she believed in buddhism and not christianity my initial response of anger moderated was to suggest if there is no faith in christ then why does she celebrate easter or christmas i suggested i would never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays with her again i do not want to drive her from the fold and would be willing to allow her to continue practicing buddhism as though i had a choice seeing her only for two days out of fourteen but i want her to want to embrace christianity any suggestions if you have a response please e mail me a copy i m not a regular reader of this newsgroup naturally feel free to post too thanks and i hope you ve had a happy easter drew drew watson systems analysis encore computer corp dwatson encore com customer services
re revelations hudson athena cs uga edu paul hudson jr writes now as to the suggestion that all prophecy tends to be somewhat cyclical can you elaborate i m not exactly sure what you mean how does the suggestion relate to isaiah s prophecy of the birth of christ by a virgin i don t see any cycles in that prophecy maybe cyclical is not the best word another example would be the scripture quoted of judas and his bishoprick let another take another example is something that isaiah said of his disciples which is also applied to christ in hebrews the children thou hast given me how does the preterist view account for this phenomenon ah double fulfillment first of all i would say that i m not sure all the prophecies had double fulfillment e g the isaiah prophecy i would say that just because this happens on some occasions does not mean it will occur always especially with regard to nt prophecies the apostles who quoted the ot and applied those passages to jesus were acting as divine messengers and giving the inerrant word of god to the church no one has that authority today no one has the apostolic authority to say that such and such a prophecy has double fulfillment if the imagry of revelation fits with events of the st century it is folly for us to try and make it apply to events centuries later tom albrecht
re easter what s in a name was re new testament double standard moderator this is a replacement for an earlier more clumsily worded submission on the same topic which i submitted a few minutes ago i think we need to distinguish etymology from meaning regardless of how the word easter originated the fact is that it does not now mean anything to christians other than the feast day of the resurrection of jesus christ the meaning of a word is only what people understand it to mean and the same goes for other cultural practices the festival of easter may possibly have some historical association with some pagan festival but today there are as far as i know no christians who intend to honor any kind of pagan goddess by celebrating easter it is nonsense to say this word or this practice really means so and so even though nobody realizes it words and practices don t mean things people do this is basic semantics i m a linguist they pay me to think about things like this michael a covington associate research scientist artificial intelligence programs mcovingt ai uga edu the university of georgia phone athens georgia u s a amateur radio n tmi further easter is specific to english in many other languages the word used is based on passover or resurrection is it ok to celebrate it in countries using those languages but not in those using english clh
catholic liturgy the problems with catholic liturgy are likely to continue for some time the problem is in a nutshell this the liturgy is a symbolic action in other words catholics do or should believe that the signs during the mass water blessings vestments altar relics etc are real that is the sprinkling of water bestows real almost tangible holiness the vestments are a real indication of real sacred time the point of a symbol is that it is understood by all to be connected to an underlying real referent this kind of thinking precludes analysis holy water is not holy because of anything it simply is holy but modern westerners find it extremely difficult especially if well educated to think of the mass as a symbol we are more likely to see it as a sign ie an action that represents grace but which could be replaced with other signs in concrete terms this means the mass has become a commercial for god s grace rather than the real thing you can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn t dare with the real thing ask coca cola co these attitudes have been encouraged by liturgy workshops etc which instead of focusing on how to do do liturgy have focused on how to create a meaning in liturgy you can only create signs symbols have to come from god or the heart or somewhere deeper than analysis the most dramatic example of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of the sacred species the consecrated host and wine now with pita bread etc it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered in particles if the host is a sign of grace this isnt and issue but catholics in the past would have been distraught at this real desacration of the real symbol of jesus body modern catholic liturgy is caught in this epistemological shift we try to perfrom the old rites but then we have some liturgomaniac priest get up and explain what we are doing so we stop doing it and start pretending to do it this is not a soul filling experience it doesn t help btw that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and three chord ersatz folk music again a result of mis analysis complicated tunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones this was the genius of wesley and the c anglican hymn writers taize is only slightly better what are we to do well i suggest rejecting the parish system if it doesn t work for you search out a church where the liturgy is well prepared not well explained they exist in every city this is not btw a matter of particular style the music might be old or new it is the attitude of the church that counts also note that a conservative liturgy harking back to pre vatican ii days does not necessarily mean the church will be socially conservative in nyc i can recommend corpus christi w st st corpus christi w st st very conservative liturgy st joseph s greenwich village modern clean largely gay oratorian church brooklyn very beautiful avoid anywhere anytime a church with electric candles happy easter christos aneste christos voskrezhne christ is risen paul halsall halsall murray fordham edu

re does god love you davem bnr ca dave mielke writes however god s love is qualified the bible says the way of the wicked is an abomination unto the lord but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness proverbs for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly shall perish psalm i am extremely uncomfortable with this way of phrasing it god s love is unconditional unqualified unfathomable we are capable of rejecting god s love but he never fails to love us these verses do not show that god s love is qualified but rather that he is opposed to evil i am uncomfortable with the tract in general because there seems to be an innappropriate emphasis on hell god deserves our love and worship because of who he is i do not like the idea of frightening people into accepting christ i see evangelism as combining a way of living that shows god s love with putting into words and explaining that love preaching the gospel without living the gospel is no better than being a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal here s a question how many of you are christians because you are afraid of going to hell how many are responding to god s love jayne kulikauskas jayne mmalt guild org
quality of catholic liturgy jemurray magnus acs ohio state edu john e murray writes i would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my wife and me lately liturgy in particular catholic liturgy in the last fe years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during mass it s driving me crazy the most grace filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is that what happens is something we all do together because we all know how do it led by the priest of course which makes it a kind of dialogue we present to god but the best masses i ve been to were participatory prayers on the one hand there are advantages to having the liturgy stay the same john has described some of these on the other hand some people seem to start tuning out the same old words and pay attention better when things get changed around i think innovative priests and liturgy committees are trying to get our attention and make things more meaningful for us it drives me crazy too different people have differing preferences and needs in liturgy my local parish is innovative i prefer to go to mass at the next parish over sometimes we don t have the option of attending a mass in the style which best suits us john put a smiley on it but to just offer it up probably is the solution a related issue that it sounds like john does not have to deal with is that spouses may have different liturgical tastes my husband does like innovative litury it is a challenge to meet both of our spiritual needs without just going our separate ways when you include the factor of also trying to satisfy our children s needs things get pretty complicated one thing to remember is that even the most uncongenial mass is still mass jayne kulikauskas jayne mmalt guild org

re atheist s views on christianity was re accepting jeesus in your heart norris athena mit edu writes this is certainly a valid objection to religion as explanation of nature fortunately for the convenience of us believers there is a class of questions that can never be reduced away by natural science for example why does the universe exist at all must there be a why to this i ask because of what you also assume about god namely that he just exists with no why to his existence so the question is reversed why can t we assume the universe just exists as you assume god to just exist why must there be a why to the universe after all the time space world didn t have to exist why does anything exist and is it possible for persons e g man to come into being out of a purely impersonal cosmos these questions which look at the real mysteries of life the creation of the world and of persons provide a permanent indicator that the meaning of life in the material world can only be found outside that world in its source it may be that one day man not only can create life but can also create man now i don t see this happening in my lifetime nor do i assert it is probable but the possibility is there given scientists are working hard at decoding out genetic code to perhaps help cure disease of a genetic variation again though must there be why or a divine prupose to man s existence when you say that man is only an animal i have to think that you are presenting an unprovable statement a dogma if you will and one the requires a kind of faith too by taking such a hard line in your atheism you may have stumbled into a religion of your own as far as we can tell man falls into the mammal catagory now if there were something more to the man say a soul then we have yet to find evidence of such but as it is now man is a mammal babies are born live mother gives milk we re warm blooded etc as other mammals are and is similar in genetic construction to some of them in particular primates for more on this check out talk origins but before you write off all christianity as phony and shallow i hope you ll do a little research into its history and varieties perhaps by reading paul johnson s a history of christianity from your remarks it seems that you have been exposed to certain types of christian religion and not others even an atheist should have enough faith in man to know that a movement of years has to have some depth and be animated by some enduring values well then buddhism confucianism taoism hinduism judaism zoerasterism shintoism and islam should fit this bit of logic quite nicely all have depth all have enduring values thus all must be true stephen atheist libertarian pro individuality pro responsibility jr and all that jazz

re quality of catholic liturgy in article apr athos rutgers edu jemurray magnus acs ohio state edu john e murray writes example last sunday palm sunday we went to the local church usually on palm sunday the congregation participates in reading the passion taking the role of the mob the theology behind this seems profound when we say crucify him we mean it we did it and if he came back today we d do it again it always gives me chills but last week we were invited to sit during the gospel passion and listen besides the orwellian invitation on palm sunday at our parish we were invited to take the role of jesus in the passion i declined to participate last year at the liturgy meeting i pointed out how we crucify christ by our sins so therefore it is appropriate that we retain the role of the crowd but to no avail musicians readers and so on new things are introduced in the course of the liturgy and since no one knows what s happening the new things have to be explained and pretty soon instead of doing a lot of the mass we re just sitting there listening or spacing out in my case to how the mass is about to be done in my mind i lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay experts but that may not be just i do think that a liturgy committee has a bias toward doing something rather than nothing that s just a fact of bureaucratic life even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for people to be aware of the lord s presence as a member of a liturgy committee i can tell you that the problem is certain people dominating who want to try out all kinds of innovations the priests don t seem even to want to make any decisions of their own in many cases i guess it s easier to try something new than it is to refuse to allow it at our parish on holy thursday instead of the priests washing feet who wants to get around people s feet according to one of our priests the congregation was invited to come up and help wash one another s hands the symbolism of this action distressed me and again i refused to participate i thought that if we were to have to come up with rubrics for this liturgical action i e body of christ amen for receiving communion that they could be i am not responsible for the blood of this man also for part of the eucharistic prayer blessed are you god of all creation was substituted some text read by a lay couple the priest certainly should not have given this part of the mass over to others and i was so disturbed that i declined to receive communion that night we aren t required to anyway i instead offered up prayers for our priests and parish so we ve been wondering are we the oddballs or is the quality of the mass going down i don t mean that facetiously we go to mass every thursday or friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware of god s presence but as far as the obligatory sunday masses maybe i should just offer it up has anyone else noticed declining congregational participation in catholic masses lately the quality of the mass has not changed again if it were to be celebrated according to the rubrics set down by the church it would still be liturgically beautiful the problem comes about from people trying to be creative who are not i think the answer to your question on participation could be that given by father peter stravinskas in answer to the question posed by the title of thomas day s why catholics can t sing they don t want to because of all this nonsense by the way for any non catholics reading this the problem does not reflect bad liturgy by the catholic church but by those who are disobedient to the church in changing it on their own authority steve creps indiana university creps lateran ucs indiana edu
certainty and arrogance dean velasco quoted a letter from james m stowell president of moody bible institute the other day i was at the dry cleaner and the radio was playing it caught my attention because a talk show guest was criticizing evangelical christians saying we believe in absolutes and think we are the only ones who know what the absolutes are we affirm the absolutes of scripture not because we are arrogant moralists but because we believe in god who is truth who has revealed his truth in his word and therefore we hold as precious the strategic importance of those absolutes there has been a lot of discussion but so far nobody seems to have hit on exactly what the criticism of arrogance is aimed at the arrogance being attacked is that we think we are the only ones who know what the absolutes are in short many evangelicals claim that they are infallible on the matter of religious texts in particular the problem is one of epistemology as a shorthand you can think of epistemology as how do you know that question it turns out is a very troubling one the problem with absolute certainty is that at the bottom at least some of the thinking goes on inside your own head unless you can be certain that everything which happens in your head is infallible the reasoning you did to discover a source of truth is in question and that means you do not have absolute justification for your source of authority which means you do not have absolute certainty let s take the specific example of biblical inerrancy and a fictional inerrantist named zeke the following arguments applies to the idea of papal infallibility too zeke has we presume spent some time studying the bible and history and several other topics he has concluded based on all these studies and possibly some religious experiences that the bible is a source of absolute truth he may be correct but even if he is he cannot be certain that he is correct his conclusion depends on how well he studied history he may have made mistakes and the references he used may have contained mistakes his conclusion depends on how well he studied the bible he may have made mistakes his conclusion depends on his own reasoning and he may have made mistakes noticing a common thread yet everything about his study of the world that he did everything that happened in his own head is limited by his own thinking no matter what he does to try and cover his mistakes he can never be certain of his own infallibility as long as any part of the belief is based on his own reasoning that belief cannot be considered absolutely certain zeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth but that belief is only as good as the quality of the search he made for it unless he can say that his own reasoning is flawless his conclusions are in doubt any belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on your own thinking there is no way out of the loop only an infallible thinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs this is easy to demonstrate let s go back to our shorthand method of doing epistemology how do you know imagine a hypothetical discussion a the bible is a source of absolute truth b how do you know a i studied history and the bible and religious writings and church teachings and came to this conclusion b how do you know you studied history correctly a well i double checked everything b how do you know you double checked correctly a well i compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed b just because some smart guy believes something that doesn t mean it is true how do you know they studied it correctly a and as you see b will eventually get a to the point where he has to say i can t prove that there are no mistakes and as long as you may have made a mistake then you cannot be absolutely certain there is no way out of the loop this is where the arrogance of christians arises many people believe that their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the doctrines of christianity they are implicitly claiming that they are infallible and that there is no possibility of mistake claiming that you cannot have made a mistake and that your thinking has led you to a flawless conclusion is pretty arrogant people who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to find the infallibility of the church by george salmon he is attacking the idea that the pope can be knowably infallible and he does so very well but the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the bible is knowably inerrant darren f provine kilroy gboro rowan edu at the core of all well founded belief lies belief that is unfounded ludwig wittgenstein

re prayer in jesus name according to what i have read on biblical idioms speaking in x s name is a standard aramaic hebrew legal idiom for what we today would call power of attorney a person from jesus culture authorized to conduct business in john s name had full authority over john s financial affairs but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to work only for john s benefit and consonant with john s wishes it was not required for the steward to preface each business transaction with in john s name it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney and be operating in good faith note the overlap here between legal and religious definitions of faith with this cultural background praying in jesus name does not mandate a particular verbal formula rather it requires that the petitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous fiduciary relationship with jesus and for the purposes of his kingdom the message of praying in jesus name is thus closely aligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about god s delegation of kingdom business to his stewards both resources and responsibilities this idea of praying in jesus name is not only present but prominent in the lord s prayer although the verbal forumula is absent the act of praying the words in jesus name may be beneficial if they cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the advancement of god s kingdom for that reason i m not quite ready to say that the praying the formula is without meaning prayers to god for other purposes desperation anger thanksgiving etc don t seem to be in this category at all whether uttered by christian or non christian whether b c or a d that s b c e or c e for you p c i don t see anything in christ s words to contradict the idea that god deals with all prayers according to his omniscience and grace van kelly vek research att com the above opinions are my own and not those of at t

make fun of no one except myself gsu uxa ecn bgu edu eric molas writes firstly i am an atheist i am not posting here as an immature flame start but rather to express an opinion to my intended audience the human being is an animal who has due to his her advanced mental facilities developed religious as a satisfiable solution to explain the unexplainable hmmm there are other animals on this planet with advanced mental facilities which have not developed religion as a satisfactory explaination for the unexplained why is this so further it appears that only humans have a need to explain the unexplained why is this so the other animals on this planet including those with advanced mental facilities seem perfectly content in their ignorance i d like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me from your unsupported statement they are humans are animal only religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need not be researched religion was made up by humans to address a perceived need the biological aspect of humans is deified that is all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical structure with biology at the apex needless to say i disagree with your strong opinion and the underlying presuppositions christianity is an infectious cult the reasons it flourishes are because it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life a safety blanked to hide behind oh wow all i have to do is follow this christian moral standard and i get eternal happiness for all of you found jeezus how many of you were on the brink i disagree that christianity is an infectious cult it has certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system in spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia that it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is infectious in a derrogatory sense it may be that it provides a workable system for its adherents and i would argue that this is the case i disagree that christianity is a safety blanket which supplants hope and purpose rather it points an individual to the one source of hope and purpose there is nothing hidden about a christian s source for hope and purpose of what usefulness to you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose and externally given hope and purpose is the apparent loss of control over one s own life the problem or is it something else finally one does not appropriate eternal happiness by following christian moral standards indeed the sole reason for the existance of christianity is because standards are inadequate to save people from their imperfections moral standards are merely guides to the christian the real power to moral living is given to the christian in the person of god s spirit heaven is one of two final states that christian doctrine postulates however christians are generally not motivated to live according to christian moral standards by this promised future reward rather they are motivated by the perceived benefits to them in the here and now but i digress the other reason christianity flourishes is its infectious nature a best friend of mine breifly entered a christian group and within months they set ministry guidelines for him which basicaly said this priority spread the word many christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a priority and rightly so for it was jesus himself who gave this as a priority for his followers however it is not the penultimate priority as evangelism is normally understood i e preach the word convert at nearly any cost repeat with new convert ad infinitum rather such evangelism is generally best done through respecting the opinions of others while demonstrating the very real benefits of a christian lifestyle this demonstration should be so powerful that it compels the non christian to seek out the christian to ask why needless to say such a demonstration is not easily accom plished it takes a radical committment to the person of jesus it does not happen quickly so perseverance on the part of the christian is required and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of friendship exist it is ineffective with strangers who cannot evaluate the demonstration over time and it is easy to alienate or harm others if the sole purpose of being a friend is to gain a conversion as a long time christian nearly years i view with some skep ticism all evangelism programs which incorporate a hurry up attitude pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no conversion at all because the pressured convert realizes s he was coerced and disavows christianity when they would have been open to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now the bible states that it is the very spirit of god which brings conviction of wrong doing to people i am content to do my part witness and let the spirit do the rest we are just animals we need sleep food and we reproduce and we die we are far more than animals we sleep eat reproduce and die just as other animals do true but we are also capable of more than this if your personal vision of humanity or of yourself is so limited i can only hope and pray that you will someday find a more expansive view for reflection what animals have the wide variety of performing arts that humans do how is it that humans can learn the language of other humans or animals but that other animals cannot do so how is it that humans can organize themselves in various social structures whereas other animals have only one structure religion especially christianity is nothing more than a drug blatant assertion christianity is not physically addictive christianity is not psychologically addictive christianity is not a thing which one snorts ingests shoots up it is a relationship with a living being you might as validly characterize any close knit relationship with this appelation some people use drugs as an escape from reality christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high there are jesus freaks who let the emotional aspects of worship and christian living gain and retain the upper hand even so this does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these things flow it pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars of which christianity has had no small part guilty by association that christianity which forces itself upon another is not christianity at all when christians see a non believer they say that person is blind to the truth but they cannot realize that it is they who live with this mask of fakeness each day jesus was just prophet who happened to have a large influence because at that time the romans were circa ad dispersing the jewish population and communities needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need you appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened years ago how did you come by it i cannot accept your conclusion that jesus influence was a sole result of the roman sack of jerusalem in ad he was years gone by this time it strains the bounds of credulity to assert that nothing about jesus life was noteworthy until the sack i must go these are but a few of my thoughts on christianity christianity is having a relationship with jesus christ himself what do you know of him we read the world wrong phil buckland and say that it deceives us psb eece ksu

re questions from a newbie the concept of god as a teacher is indeed interesting does he grade on a curve does he cheat that is interesting not to mention thought provoking my own concept is that he is a father and we are his children in that he loves us with a love that we can never understand until we are with him the bible says that he looks on the heart as the final measure from that perspective in a grading context the heart is the final test specifically most christians would agree that there is only one heaven and one hell from that perspective it is heaven or hell you either go to one or the other the grading on a pass fail basis is done by god the father with intervention by jesus the son not by others for only god sees the heart the bible says of the heart who can know it i would say there has always been and always be an unchanging method that is what makes a relationship with christ so secure in an uncertain and ever changing landscape he is always the same yesterday today and tomorrow concerning whether or not our childhoods are considerd as part of the test my own conviction is no were that the case i certainly wouldn t be going to heaven the bible speaks very plainly about the love and care jesus had for and about children the reality is that we are all children some of us just have bigger bodies and grey hair but the father our father is always there like most fathers he wants only the best for his own there maybe decipline but there is more love it s sometimes looks like christianity is a test to see who makes it and who doesn t those who do pass heaven and those who don t go to the other place but it is really much more than that there are few experts most of us are just travelers looking for the light and the way home praying that we can bring others with us
re eternity of hell was re hell vic mmalt guild org vic kulikauskas writes our moderator writes i m inclined to read descriptions such as the lake of fire as indicating annihilation however that s a minority view it s my personal view but the only denominations i know of that hold it officially are the jw s and sda s i can t find the reference right now but didn t c s lewis speculate somewhere that hell might be the state of once having been a human soul why is it that we have this notion that god takes some sort of pleasure from punishing people the purpose of hell is to destroy the devil and his angels to the earlier poster who tried to support the eternal hell theory with the fact that the fallen angels were not destroyed remember the bible teaches that god has reserved them until the day of judgement their judgement is soon to come let me suggest this maybe those who believe in the eternal hell theory should provide all the biblical evidence they can find for it stay away from human theories and only take into account references in the bible darius

proof of resurection i have a few minor problems with the article posted as proof of christ s resurrection first the scriptural quotations this sort of reasoning is such that if you beleive you are justified if not then your beleif is in vain so you might as well beleive most of these quotations are of people who do beleive people who would try to justify their own positions second the logical proof quoted text from xx yfn ysu edu family magazine sysops subject witness proof of christ s resurrection date apr gmt much deleted in nearly centuries no body has ever been produced to refute jesus assertion that he would indeed rise from the dead the probability of being able to perpetrate such a hoax successfully upon the entire world for nearly centuries is astronomically negative end quoted text the period of time that has elapsed from the event growing larger does not increase the odds that a hoax would be discovered in fact the longer a hoax is perpetuated the stronger it becomes finally there is no proof of the resurrection of christ except in our spirits communion with his and the father s it is a matter of faith belief without logical proof incedently one of the largest stumbling blocks for rational western man myself included i hope that this is taken in the spirit it was intended and not as a rejection of the resurrection s occurance i beleive but i wanted to point out the weakness of logical proofs

re a question that has bee bothering me in article apr athos rutgers edu atterlep vela acs oakland edu cardinal ximenez writes religious people are threatened by science because it has been systematically removing the physical proofs of god s existence as time goes on we have to rely more and more on faith and the spiritual world to relate to god becuase science is removing our props i don t think this is a bad thing first of all i resent your assumption that you know why i am threatened by science or even that i am threatened at all although i admit the latter the reason i am threatened by science has nothing to do with my need for proof of my lord s existence god reveals himself in many ways including to some degree science my problem with science is that often it allows us to assume we know what is best for ourselves god endowed us with the ability to produce life through sexual relations for example but he did not make that availible to everyone does that mean that if science can over ride god s decision through alterations that god wills for us to have the power to decide who should and should not be able to have children should men be allowed to have babies if that is made possible people have always had the ability to end lives unnaturally and soon may have the ability to bring lives into the world unnaturally the closest thing to artificially created life is artificially created death and as god has reserved judgement about when people should die to himself i believe we should rely on god s wisdom about how people should be brought in to the world this is not to say that i reject all forms of medical treatment however treatment that alleviates pain or prevents pain from occuring is perfectly acceptable i believe as it was acceptable for jesus to cure the sick however treatment that merely prolongs life for no reason or makes unnecessary alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes go too far are we not happy with the beauty god gave us i cannot draw a solid line regarding where i would approve of scientific study and where i would not but i will say this before one experiments with the universe to find out all its secrets one should ask why they want this knowledge before one alters the body they have been given they should ask themseles why their body is not satisfactory too them as it is i cannot make any general rules that will cover all the cases but i will say that each person should pray for guidance when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe and should cease their unravelling if they have reason to believe their search is displeasing to god malcusco

re the arrogance of christians in article apr athos rutgers edu caralv caralv auto trol com carol alvin writes vbv r d eeap cwru edu virgilio dean b velasco jr writes in article apr athos rutgers edu caralv caralv auto trol com carol alvin writes are all truths also absolutes is all of scripture truths and therefore absolutes the answer to both questions is yes perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then to me an absolute is something that is constant across time culture situations etc true in every instance possible do you agree with this definition i think you do similarly all truth is absolute indeed a non absolute truth is a contradiction in terms when is something absolute when it is always true obviously if a truth is not always true then we have a contradiction in terms i agree with carol here determining absolutes is practically speaking a waste of time and we easily forget that relative truth is in fact relative for example i recently was asking some children the question what temperature does water boil at i got the answer degrees consistently i asked if they knew what scale and was told it s just degrees any scale that s what all thermometers say well that s sincere and may be true in the experience of the speaker but it is simply wrong it is not an absolute truth similarly scripture is full of truth which we should nurture and cherish but trying to determine which parts are absolute truth and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time and culture in which the text was penned is missing the point then religion easily becomes an intellectual head trip devoid of the living experience of the indwelling trinity and becomes dead scholasticism imo example of head covering in church deleted this was a good example there may be an absolute truth behind the writing but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the instructions apply to the corinthians and not necessarily elsewhere the instructions may reflect absolute truth in the context of first century culture and the particular climate at corinth which was having a lot of trouble with order is it absolute truth to me no and i see no compelling or even reasonable reason that it should be evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth and there are plenty of other examples can you reconcile this even the most die hard literalists do not take all of the bible literally i ve yet to meet anyone who takes the verse blessed is he who takes your babies and smashes their heads against the rocks literally the bible was not printed or handed to us by god with color codings to tell us what parts should be interpreted which way many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world such a statement is terribly self contradictory let me put it to you this way if there are no absolutes shouldn t we conclude that the statement there are no absolutes is not absolutely true obviously we have a contradiction here i don t claim that there are no absolutes i think there are very few though and determining absolutes is difficult i agree very few and even if we knew them personally we may not be able to express that in a way that still conveys absolute truth to another the presence of absence of absolutes may not make any difference since i know i can never fully apprehend an absolute if it walks up and greets me there is hardly consensus even in evangelical christianity not to mention the rest of christianity regarding biblical interpretation so people sometimes disagree about what is true this does not negate the fact however that there are still absolutes in the universe i can t prove the existence of absolutes i can only rely upon my experience i also trust god s revelation that we cannot fully comprehend the infinite therefore we can t comprehend the absolutes so i don t need them i can never know the essence of god only the energies by and through which god is manifested to god s creation so the reality can be that there are absolutes but it is of no practical importance it s like claiming that the original scriptural autographs were perfect but copies may not be swell who cares it doesn t affect me in any practical useful way i might as well believe that god has made a lot of electric blue chickens and that they live on mars maybe god did so what is that going to have any effect on how i deal with my neighbor or god whether or not i go to this or that cafeteria for lunch no this attitude leads many non christians to believe that all christians are arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning christianity is true wonderful and sensible it appeals to reason since reason is an inner reflection of the logos of god explanations that violate that simply appear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world note i m not claiming there is no place for authority that d be silly there is a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that and is generally

re atheist s views on christianity was re accepting jeesus in your heart in article apr athos rutgers edu trajan cwis unomaha edu stephen mcintyre writes norris athena mit edu writes the discussion begins why does the universe exist at all must there be a why to this i ask because of what you also assume about god namely that he just exists with no why to his existence so the question is reversed why can t we assume the universe just exists as you assume god to just exist why must there be a why to the universe one of the laws of nature specifying cause and effect seems to dictate at least to this layman s mind there must be a causal event no reasonable alternative exists as far as i can tell the very laws of nature demand a why that isn t true of something outside of nature i e super natural it may be that one day man not only can create life but can also create man now i don t see this happening in my lifetime nor do i assert it is probable but the possibility is there given scientists are working hard at decoding out genetic code to perhaps help cure disease of a genetic variation again though must there be why or a divine prupose to man s existence i believe the genetic code will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining reproducing life ever i ve never been much of a prophet though i can t even picture new york in my mind i don t believe any technology would be able to produce that necessary spark of life despite having all of the parts available just my opinion when you say that man is only an animal i have to think that you are presenting an unprovable statement a dogma if you will and one the requires a kind of faith too by taking such a hard line in your atheism you may have stumbled into a religion of your own as far as we can tell man falls into the mammal catagory now that preposition sort of precludes an absolute doesn t it without an absolute conclusion what are we left with i believe the word faith works nicely if there were something more to the man say a soul then we have yet to find evidence of such but as it is now man is a mammal babies are born live mother gives milk we re warm blooded etc as other mammals are and is similar in genetic construction to some of them in particular primates for more on this check out talk origins but before you write off all christianity as phony and shallow i hope you ll do a little research into its history and varieties perhaps by reading paul johnson s a history of christianity from your remarks it seems that you have been exposed to certain types of christian religion and not others even an atheist should have enough faith in man to know that a movement of years has to have some depth and be animated by some enduring values well then buddhism confucianism taoism hinduism judaism zoerasterism shintoism and islam should fit this bit of logic quite nicely all have depth all have enduring values thus all must be true well then with an equal scale and under an equal standard investigate them all and discover where god is or whether he is for the denial of god is ultimately a statement of faith non falsifiable as his existence may be for isn t this the purpose of religion to discover and in discovery to know god you don t mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your research do you after all if we of christ are deluding ourselves you really have nothing to worry about eh until the king returns jason jason d smith jasons atlastele com i m not young enough to know everything x
re the arrogance of christians they believe the danger is real but others may not does that mean that the first group are necessarily arrogant in warning others of the danger does it mean that they are saying that their beliefs are correct and all others are false some might indeed react to opposition with arrogance and behave in an arrogant manner but that is a personal idiocyncracy it does not necessarily mean that they are all arrogant no the members of the first group are not necessarily arrogant but when i ask them if they are absolutely certain that the volcano will erupt i expect them to say so no but i ve chosen to believe some knowledgable people who have determined that the volcano will erupt rather than yes i am absolutely certain when it comes to religious discussions arrogance or at best naivete is reflected in the latter type of statement louis j kim o ph southwest research institute fax post office drawer lkim swri edu san antonio tx compuserve com

re certainty and arrogance in article apr athos rutgers edu kilroy gboro rowan edu dr nancy s sweetie writes dean velasco quoted a letter from james m stowell president of moody bible institute we affirm the absolutes of scripture not because we are arrogant moralists but because we believe in god who is truth who has revealed his truth in his word and therefore we hold as precious the strategic importance of those absolutes there has been a lot of discussion but so far nobody seems to have hit on exactly what the criticism of arrogance is aimed at lots of stuff deleted this is where the arrogance of christians arises many people believe that their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the doctrines of christianity they are implicitly claiming that they are infallible and that there is no possibility of mistake claiming that you cannot have made a mistake and that your thinking has led you to a flawless conclusion is pretty arrogant i agree with what darren has to say here but would like to add a personal observation what i see as arrogance and the problem i have with it is not a sense of personal certainty but a lack of respect for others who come to differing conclusions clearly this is not just christian vs non christian there is a whole spectrum of belief systems within christianity i do not tend to argue with others about matters of personal faith because like aesthetics it is not demonstable by objective means choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal sovereignty what bothers me is when others suggest that in these matters of faith their specific beliefs are not only true to them but are absolute and should be binding on others it follows from this that god must give everyone the same revelation of truth and thus anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing the wrong path this is the arrogance i see a lack of respect for the honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and god even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others it is universalizing those matters of personal faith coupled by a proud notion that one s relationship with god is superior to other s that leads to arrogance in my honest and nonuniversal opinion darren f provine kilroy gboro rowan edu at the core of all well founded belief lies belief that is unfounded ludwig wittgenstein comments criticism welcome ken alvin ucsu colorado edu it is certainly reasonable to ask for some humility about our own ability to know the truth there are also different paths in some areas of practice but i d like to see more clarification about what you mean when you reject the idea of saying their specific beliefs are not only true to them but are absolute and should be binding on others if something is true it is true for everyone assuming that the belief is something about god history etc of course something of the form i believe that it s best for me not to xxx could be true for some people and not others i have suggested in the past that god may be less concerned about doctrinal agreement than many people are but that doesn t mean i doubt that there is a difference between true and false nor that i think there is no benefit in finding out what is true clh

re the arrogance of christians mhsu lonestar utsa edu melinda hsu writes i d like to share my thoughts on this topic of arrogance of christians and look forward to any responses in my encounters with christians i find myself dismayed by their belief that their faith is total truth according to them their beliefs come from the bible and the bible is the word of god and god is truth thus they know the truth this stance makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own hesitations about christianity because they see no other way their way is the truth but i see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe a particular way that choice is part faith and part reason but it seems to me a choice i m sort of mystified about how a christian might respond to this i ll start with a parable a christian woman hires a carpenter to build her a birdhouse when he comes over they begin talking about religion so you believe that you understand god he asks yes i do she replies then have him build you the birdhouse i don t think that melinda is complaining about the basis of christian belief however there is a tendency among christians to say i have all the answers because god gave them to me this is simply not the case i believe that the bible is inerrant however our human interpretations of the bible are necessarily in error because we are human and imperfect we have to remember that we all make mistakes in faith and that because we are human we have an imperfect understanding of the mind and will of god to claim as so many people do that the existence of the bible allows us to determine the answers to all questions is to claim that we humans can fully understand god s will this is hubris

re the arrogance of christians carol alvin caralv caralv auto trol com wrote in the new testament sorry i don t have a bible at work and can t provide a reference women are instructed to be silent and cover their heads in church now this is scripture by your definition this is truth and therefore absolute do women in your church speak do they cover their heads if all scripture is absolute truth it seems to me that women speaking in and coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals yet clearly women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare heads at least this was the case in the evangelical churches i grew up in evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth and there are plenty of other examples can you reconcile this the problem you see here is that some christians claim things about the bible which they don t actually believe or practice i ve known all sorts of christians ranging from the trendiest of liberals to the fire breathing fundamentalists and although many on the conservative side of the christian faith do claim that the bible is a perhaps the source of absolute truth i don t know of anyone who treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition while i am not a roman catholic i believe this is close to the official position of the rc church perhaps an rc would like to comment the particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in terms of the social context of the time you would think the fact that the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat and cane and give you some big song and dance routine about why this other passages as well aren t directly applicable today would show them that what they claim about the bible and what they actually practice are two different things but mostly it doens t while this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of christians i would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy in this case making claims about the bible which the claimants don t actually put into practice but if we step back from the name calling and look at what people are attempting to say we see that they are trying to express very concisely the unique place the bible holds within the christian faith so when people use such words or phrases as word of god inerrant infallibale the manufacturer s handbook the only rule of faith and practice in the church today to describe the bible we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at the mere words they use some of the above descriptions are demostratably false and others are self contradictory but in my experience people are generally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even when the speaker s words are at variance with their intentions a biblical example is from the garden of eden where god asks where are you and adam explains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself if adam had answered god s words he would have said something like i m here in this tree the problem seems to arise when christians insist that these words are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif most people have not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of the place of the bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases and explanations that others use i hope this helps bill rea o o w u w bill rea computer services centre e mail b rea csc canterbury ac nz university of canterbury or cctr csc canterbury ac nz christchurch new zealand phone fax

re eternity of hell was re hell in article apr athos rutgers edu dlecoint garnet acns fsu edu darius lecointe writes insert deletion of unnecessary quote why is it that we have this notion that god takes some sort of pleasure from punishing people the purpose of hell is to destroy the devil and his angels first of all god does not take any sort of pleasure from punishing people he will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on whom he will have compassion ex however if he enjoyed punishing people and sending them to hell then why would he send jesus to seek and save that which was lost luke to the earlier poster who tried to support the eternal hell theory with the fact that the fallen angels were not destroyed remember the bible teaches that god has reserved them until the day of judgement their judgement is soon to come let me suggest this maybe those who believe in the eternal hell theory should provide all the biblical evidence they can find for it stay away from human theories and only take into account references in the bible you asked for it peter ff talks about how those who are ungodly are punished matthew is also very clear that those who do not righteous in god s eyes will be sent to hell for eternity thessalonians states that those who cause trouble for the disciples will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the lord thessalonians talks about those who refuse to love the truth being condemned revelation talks about the difference between those who overcomes and those who do not those who do not listed in verse will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur revelation gives the indication that those who follow the beast will be tormented with burning sulfur and there being no rest day or night for them because of it psalm the wicked return to the grave all the nations that forget god i think those should be sufficient to prove the point darius joe fisher in the following i m mostly playing devil s advocate i m not advocating either position my concern is that people understand that it s possible to see these passages in different ways it s possible to see eternal destruction as just that destruction rev often uses the term second death the most obvious understanding of that would seem to be final extinction the problem is that the nt speaks both of eternal punishment and of second death i e it uses terms that can be understood either way my concern here is not to convince you of one view or the other but to help people understand that there s a wide enough variety of images that it s possible to understand them either way as tom albrecht commented the primary point is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire whatever the details to make things more interesting luke implies that the damned don t get resurrected at all presumably they just stay dead yes i m aware that it s possible to understand this passage in a non literal way peter ff is talking about angels and talks about holding them in hell until the final judgement this isn t eternal punishement matthew talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels the fact that the fire is eternal doesn t mean that people will last in its flames forever particularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been prepared for the devil and his angels rev and talk about the eternal fire as well they say that the beast and the false prophet will be tormented forever in it when talking about people being thrown into it it is referred to as the second death this sounds more like extinction than eternal torment is is possible that the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as the devil and humans thessalonians similarly what is everlasting destruction this is not necessarily eternal torment this one can clearly be understood either way but i think it s at least possible to think that everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction that can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in eternity thessalonians again talks about destruction revelation see comment above revelation is probably the best of the quotes even there it doesn t explicitly say that the people suffer forever it says that the smoke and presumably the fire is eternal and that there is no respite from it but it doesn t say that the people are tormented forever psalm i don t see that it says anything relevant to this issue clh

some questions from a new christian hi i am new to this newsgroup and also fairly new to christianity i was raised as a unitarian and have spent the better part of my life as an agnostic but recently i have developed the firm conviction that the christian message is correct and i have accepted jesus into my life i am happy but i realize i am very ignorant about much of the bible and quite possibly about what christians should hold as true this i am trying to rectify by reading the bible of course but it would be helpful to also read a good interpretation commentary on the bible or other relevant aspects of the christian faith one of my questions i would like to ask is can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological works intended for a lay person i have another question i would like to ask i am not yet affiliated with any one congregation aside from matters of taste what criteria should one use in choosing a church i don t really know the difference between the various protestant denominations thanks for reading my post sincerely steve hoskins aside from a commentary you might also want to consider an introduction these are books intended for use in undergraduate bible courses they give historical background discussion of literary styles etc and generally they have good bibligraphies for further reading i typically recommend kee froehlich and young s nt introduction there are also some good one volume commentaries they often have background articles that are helpful probably the best recommendation these days would be harper s bible commentary i think there may be a couple of books with this title this is a fairly recent one like about done in cooperation with the society for biblical criticism if you are committed to inerrancy you will probably prefer something more conservative i don t read a lot of conservative books but a commentary i looked at by donald guthrie looked rather good he has a nt introduction and he s also editor of eerdman s bible commentary clh
re sabbath admissions of someone sent me this faq by e mail and i post my response here i m not enforcing the inclusion limits on this faq because most of our readers probably haven t seen it clh christ warns that anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches otheres to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven matt this faq is so full of error that i must respond to it i hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the partisan theology brothers and sisters being new to the faith and examining the decalogue closely i ve noticed the fourth commandment is pretty specific about keeping the sabbath day it states the th day saturday is the sabbath while most christian religions keep or atleast go to church on sunday what s up this is a frequently asked question every time it arises it causes months of debate so let me see if i can answer you directly basically it s because the law was given to moses as part of a specific covenanent with the jews most of us aren t jews so we aren t part of that covenant there was an argument early in christian history about whether the mosaic laws should apply to gentiles who became christians you can see the account of this debate in acts the main question there was circumcision but keeping the sabbath would be part of it as well the apostles concluded that we need not become jews in order to become christians and therefore that rules such as circumcision did not apply to us the law was known to man before it was revealed on mount sinai rom notes that where no law is there is no transgression not only did sin exist before sinai eden but the sabbath was kept before it was revealed on sinai ex the problem with the first covenant was not the law but the promise which undergirded it god wanted to perform his will in the lives of the people but in their ignorance after years of slavery they promised what ever he says to do we will do that is why the new covenant is based on better promises heb rather than do away with the law god promised to put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts heb including the sabbath in the acts is selective inclusion the sabbath was more important to the jews than circumcision if any attempt had been made to do away with the sabbath the reaction would have been even more strident than is recorded in acts do not confuse the weekly sabbath of the decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at any time of the week and were part of the law ceremonial which was added because of transgression of the moral law gal israel stands for god s people of all time that is why god grafted the gentiles in roma says that the adoption the glory the covenants the giving of the law the service of god and the promises belong to israelites in explanation paul makes it clear that being born into israel is not enough for they are not all israel which are of israel v then in gal he says if ye be christ s then are ye abraham s seed and heirs according to the promise all christians are abraham s seed jews israelites not physically for that is not the criterion but spiritually we are joint heirs with jesus based on the promise god made to all his people the israelites while christians agree that the ot laws do not all apply to us because some of them are part of a specific covenanent with the jews we also expect to see some similarity between the things god expected from the jews and the things he expects from us after all it s the same god however there are several ways of dealing with this these days the most common approach is to separate the ot commandments into moral and ceremonial ceremonial commandments apply only to the jews they are part of the specific mosaic covenant these are thinsg like the kosher laws and circumcision moral laws apply to everyone most of the commands are part of the moral law except for the commandment about the sabbath i believe most people who take this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on the sabbath is part of the ceremonial law but a general obligation to worship regularly is part of the general moral law thus christians are free to choose the specific time we worship people would probably agree but they are wrong how can the sabbath commandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the ceremonial laws you are not free to choose your time of worship even if you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan sun worship would you rather give up a day which god blessed sanctified and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders agree has not biblical foundation see sabbath admissions in soc religion christian bible study a more radical approach which is generally connected with john calvin and the reformed tradition says that the law as a whole is no longer binding instead we are entirely under grace and our behavior should be guided solely by love portions of the ot law are still useful as guidance but they are not properly speaking legally binding on us in practice most people who take this position do not believe it is safe to leave christians without moral guidannce while we may no longer be under law as sinners it s not safe for us to go into situations with no principles to guide us we re too good at self justification for that to be safe thus christians do have moral guidance from things like jesus teachings paul s advice etc these may not be precisely a law but they serve much the same function as and have largely the same content as the moral law in the previous analysis while calvin would deny that we have a fixed legal responsibility to worship on any specific day he would say that given human weakness the discipline of regular worship is important i do not care what calvin or any theologian says my guide is what god says if being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the sabbath commandment which is the only one god thought was important enough to say remember if you study the word deeply you will note that the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but freed by the grace of god if a cop pulls me over for speeding then in court i ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me grace do i walk out of the court saying i can now go on speeding for i am now under grace being under grace i now drive within the speed limit paul adds to it in rom di we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the law wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good rom in both analyses the specific day is not an issue as a matter of tradition we worship on sunday as a memorial of christ s resurrection there s some debate about what acts shows about early christian worship the most common analysis is that is shows jewish christians continuing to go to jewish services on the sabbath but that specifically christian service were not necessarily held then act shows worship on the first day sunday and i cor also implies gatherings on that day there are a few groups that continue to believe christians have to worship on the sabbath saturday the best known are the seventh day adventists and jehovah s witnesses they argue that act is not a regular worship service but a special meeting to see paul off and that i cor doesn t explicitly say it s a regular worship service do you prefer implication to fact a careful study of the acts shows that the meeting was on saturday night and that on sunday morning paul did not go to a worship service but set off on a long journey by foot to assos in icor there is no way you can equate lay by him in store with go to a worship service it s clear that this issue was a contested one in paul s time see rom paul s advice is that we should be very careful about judging each other on issues like this one person sees a specific day as mandated by god while another does not he who observes that specific day does it in honor of the lord he who believes his worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the lord those who believe that the sabbath is still mandated argue that paul is not referring to sabbath worship here note however col which says something similar but briefer it explicitly mentions sabbath wrong these are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law not the sabbath day of the moral law there are some differences among christians about use of the word sabbath originally the term referred to the th day the jewish day of worship many christians now use it to refer to sunday the day of christian worship they do this largely so that they can apply the th or whatever there are a couple of different numbering schemes commandment to it reformed tradition does not do this it distinguishes between the sabbath which is the observance mandated for jews and the lord s day which is the free christian worship the only reference i can find to this in the nt is rev there are also differences about laws regarding this day many christians support blue laws both in secular law and church law setting aside that day and causing people to spend it in worship the more radical anti legal approach sees such regulations as a return to the jewish sabbath which is not appropriate to the free christian worship of the lord s day why would you prefer to twist and turn relying on different arguments which conflict with each other rather than obey a simple request from a god who loved you enough to die for you jesus died because the law could not be changed why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a broken law if all you need to do is change the law penalties for law breaking means the law is immutable that is why it is no sin not to follow the demands of the ceremonial laws it will always be a sin to make false gods to violate god s name to break the sabbath to steal to kill etc except it you disagree but then your opinion has no weight when placed next to the word of god darius it s not clear how much more needs to be said other than the faq i think paul s comments on esteeming one day over another rom is probably all that needs to be said i accept that darius is doing what he does in honor of the lord i just wish he might equally accept that those who esteem all days alike are similarly doing their best to honor the lord however i d like to be clear that i do not think there s unambiguous proof that regular christian worship was on the first day as i indicated there are responses on both of the passages cited the difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something else they both look like they are talking about nnregular christian meetings but neither explicitly says and they gathered every sunday for worship we get various pieces of information but nothing aimed at answering this question act describes christians as participating both in jewish temple worship and in christian communion services in homes obviously the temple worship is on the sabbath acts is an example of christians participating in them unfortunately it doesn t tell us what day christians met in their houses acts despite darius confusion is described by acts as occuring on sunday i see no reason to impose modern definitions of when days start when the biblical text is clear about what was meant the wording implies to me that this was a normal meeting it doesn t say they gathered to see paul off but that when they were gathered for breaking bread paul talked about his upcoming travel but that s just not explicit enough to be really convincing similarly with cor it says that on the first day they should set aside money for paul s collection now if you want to believe that they gathered specially to do this or that they did it in their homes i can t disprove it but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be when they normally gather for worship and if they were expected to do it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day so i think the most obvious reading of this is that on the first day of every week simply means every time they gather for worship i think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the nt authors assumed that their readers knew when christian worship was clh

hearing sinners on the question does god hear the prayers of sinners we need to distinguish if we say that he never hears the prayers of any who have sinned we make pointless all prayers by anyone born less than centuries ago but if we consider the prayers of the impenitent sinner of someone who says lord i want you to do this for me but don t expect me to change my way of life that is a different matter even here i would not venture to say that god never grants such petitions just as he sends sun and rain on the evil and on the good however if someone we know well is praying to god in that spirit we might have the responsibility to say remember if god s help is real then so are his commands yours james kiefer

religious wars i don t know if this is the sort of thing you guys like to discuss i guess it falls into the area of apologetics this is a question that seems to pop up now and again in conversations with non christians it usually appears in the following sort of unqualified statement well you know that religion has caused more wars than anything else it bothers me that i cannot seem to find a satisfactory response to this after all if our religion is all about peace and love why have there been so many religious wars personally i am of the view that religion has often been used as an excuse to instigate wars often to disguise national ambitions but i would love to hear what anyone else has to say about this subject thanks in advance andrew j fraser if we re thinking in terms of history the crusades northern ireland yugoslavia come immediately to mind northern ireland yugoslavia name andrew james fraser e mail fraseraj dcs gla ac uk ese h student university of glasgow standard disclaimers i m beginning to suspect that the natural condition of humans is conflict perhaps we should not ask whether a religion or philosophy has been involved in any wars since they all have but whether it has stopped any clh

re atheist s views on christianity was re accepting jeesus in your heart in article apr geneva rutgers edu jasons atlastele com jason smith writes in article apr athos rutgers edu kempmp phoenix oulu fi petri pihko writes this is not true science is a collection of models telling us how not why something happens i cannot see any good reason why the why questions would be bound only to natural things assuming that the supernatural domain exists if supernatural beings exist it is as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist i beg to disagree with the assertion that science is a collection of models scientific models are a game to play and are only as good as the assumptions and measurements if any that go into them as an example i remember when nuclear winter was the big hype in atmospheric science it wasn t long after sagan s admonitions that one of our boys was adding another level of reality into his model of the nuclear winter scenario at erl in boulder he decided to assume that the atmosphere is more like a two dimensional thing than a one dimensional thing he also assumed that it rained and that the winds blow in the real atmosphere on returning to georgia tech he showed a transparency of atmospheric cooling rates according to the year they were generated by the models there was an unmistakable correlation between the age meaning simplicity of assumptions i e remoteness from reality of each model and the degree of cooling whereas sagan s model showed an approximate degree cooling episode the next model in sophistication showed about half that and so on until we got to our boy s model which showed a degree drop if the war happened in the winter and less than a degree drop if it happened in the summer he predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans chemistry the biosphere and other indicators of reality in the models we would probably see even less cooling thus nuclear winter was reduced to even less than a nuclear autumn one might say to a nuclear fizzle to quote from h s yoder the postulated models have become accepted as the reality instead of the lattice of assumptions they are authoritarianism dominates the field and a very critical analysis of each argument is to be encouraged skepticism of the model approach to earth problems is warranted because many key parameters have not been included this statement surely applies equally well to cosmogony only when convincing observational evidence substantiates the modeled results may one suggest that the model may describe the reality just thought i d clear that up before things really got out of hand boundary no teneis que pensar que yo haya venido a traer la paz a la tierra no he venido a traer la paz sino la guerra mateo vulgata latina
revelations babylon hello all we are doing a bible study at my college on revelations we have been doing pretty good as far as getting some sort of reasonable interpretation we are now on chapters and which talk about the woman on the beast and the fall of babylon i believe the beast is the antichrist some may differ but it seems obvious and the woman represents babylon which stands for rome or the roman catholic church what are some views on this interpretation is the falling babylon in chapter the same babylon in as in chapter the catholic church hate to step on toes thanks jimmy buddenberg internet jbuddenberg vax cns muskingum edu muskingum college reading this imagery as the roman catholic church was certainly common in earlier protestant writers a lot of us find that frankly embarassing now though some of our readers will certainly advocate such a position the problem is that the description makes it look a lot like a political entity it s associated with kings controls world commerce is seated on seven mountains recall that rome is traditionally regarded as built on seven hills if it s a church then it s not the current roman catholic church but a church that has been taken over by the anti christ and merged with the state turning into something rather different than it is now presumably in such a scenario the true catholics are among those who are persecuted given the overall impression that satan is pretending to be an angel of light and the true church is a persecuted remnant i think the most consistent playing out of the image would be that the anti christ would be presiding over a church that claims to be the heir of both the protestant and catholic traditions but that the true spiritual descendants of both peter and the reformers are equally being persecuted clh
doing the work of god as our local religion christian bbs group seems moribund i m posting here on one of the sundays just before easter i went to church the sermon was based on a story in the book of joshua the one about joshua sending out spies to the land he was planning to take what i particularly remember because of having heard part of a cbc radio documentary on bosnia was that the rahab the woman who sheltered the spies said that the people were melting in fear what with having heard that cbc radio documentary and knowing that the muslims in bosnia were losing the war i felt uncomfortable after all the serbs are driving non christians out on the other hand ministers do say that the bible is opposed to the values held by our secular society anyhow members of that church are involved in out of country missionary work also the pastor has talked of spiritual warfare and of bringing christ to the nonreligious people of our area the next sunday the sermon was about joshua where the israelites take jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there except for rahab who had sheltered the spies with those reports about bosnia in my mind i felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that the massacre the one in joshua was right but what really bothered me was that if i was going to try taking christianity seriously i shouldn t be so troubled about the reports of ethnic cleansing in bosnia certainly my sympathies shouldn t be with the moslims considering that the bosnian muslims are descendants of christians who under turkish rule converted to islam could the serbs be doing god s work the example of god s people setting out on bloody wars of conquest has always been troubling in discussions here i personally question whether they were right even at the time but those who believe they were consider that the wars were justified only because they were specifically commanded by god somehow i don t see the serbs behaving like a group that is led by god in this matter clh

re did he really rise in article apr athos rutgers edu ata hfsi hfsi com john ata writes i think you are vastly oversimplifying things we know that early christians suffered totures because of their witness to christ for example act it appears that the jewish rulers of that time had a particular aversion to even hearing jesus s name finally the first apostle s death james of zebedee was certainly not by rome s hand any more than the first martyr stephen the problem was that if one believed in the resurrection then one must believe in jesus as truly being the son of god and what he stood for and preached during his ministry on earth that would have been extremely difficult for some people especially those that had plotted to kill him the basic problem with your argument is your total and complete reliance on the biblical text luke s account is highly suspect i would refer you to the hermeneia commentary on acts moreover luke s account is written at least years after the fact in the meantime everyone he mentions has died and attempts to find actual written sources behind the text have come up with only the we section of the later portion of acts as firmly established moreover pauls account of some of the events in acts as recorded in galatians fail to establish the acts accounts what we need therefore is a reliable text critically appreciated which documents the death of christians for belief in the resurrection i would suggest you look at some greek and roman historians i think you will be disapointed randy

etymology of easter for src in most languages the feast of the resurrection of our lord is known as the pasch or pasque or some variation thereof a word which comes from the hebrew pesach meaning passover in english german and a few related languages however it is known as easter or some variation thereof and questions have been asked about the origin of this term one explanation is that given by the venerable bede in his de ratione temporum where he derives the word from the name of an anglo saxon goddess of spring called eastre bede is a great scholar and it is natural to take his word for it but he lived and augustine began preaching in kent in the use of the word easter to describe the feast would have been well established before the birth of bede and probably before the birth of anyone he might have discussed the subject with it seems likely that his derivation is just a guess based on his awareness that there had been an anglo saxon goddess of spring bearing that name and the resemblance of the words thus if the said resemblance surely it is not surprising that a personification of spring should have a name similar to the word for dawn is not in istelf convincing the testimony or rather the conjecture by bede does not make it more so assuming that bede was right that would not justify saying that the christian celebration which after all had been going on for some centuries before the name easter was applied to it has pagan roots it would simply mean that the anglo saxons upon becoming christians and beginning to celebrate the resurrection by a festival every spring called it by the name that to them meant simply spring festival however bede s is not the only theory that has been proposed j knoblech in die sprach zeitschrift fuer sprachwissenschaft vienna offers the following derivation among latin speaking christians the week beginning with the feast of the resurrection was known as hebdomada alba white week since the newly baptized christians were accustomed to wear their white baptismal robes throughout that week sometimes the week was referred to simply as albae translaters rendering this into german mistook it for the plural of alba meaning dawn they accordingly rendered it as eostarum which is old high german for dawn this gave rise to the form easter in english yours james kiefer no i m not interested in restarting discussions of the propriety of celebrating easter however this seems like it contains enough interesting information that people might like to see it clh

paul on weekly collections mark gregory foster writes concerning corinthians the idea was introduced to me once that the reason paul wanted the corinthians to lay aside money for the collection on the first day of the week was that this was when they received their weekly wages but the ancient romans did not observe a seven day week unless a man was working for a jewish employer he is unlikely to have been paid on the first day of a seven day week nor would a jewish employer have kept his wages over the week end see lev dt yours james kiefer

iterations of the bible hi i m not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame thanx in advance i want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible there is this version of the bible i have read about and on the front page it says contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies thanx in advance shaz i m not sure quite what you mean by many different versions the primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style of the translation it s pretty unusual to see significant differences in meaning there are a few differences in the underlying text that s because before printing manuscripts were copied by hand slight differences resulted there are enough manuscripts around that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the original but there are some uncertainties fortunately they are generally at the level of minor differences in wording there are something like or places where whole sentences are involved but with recent discoveries of older manuscripts i don t think there s much uncertainly about those cases as far as i know no christians believe that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of translating is free of error but i also don t think there s enough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that it has much practical effect whether the bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot topic of debate here many christians deny it some accept it though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details that don t affect the faith but this has nothing to do with there being multiple versions the supposed inconsistences can be found in all the versions i m surprised to find a reference to this on the title page though what version are you talking about i ve been referring to major scholarly translations these are what get referenced in postings here and elsewhere there have certainly been editions that are to be kind less widely accepted this includes everything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into single narrations to editions that omit material that the editor objects to for some reason or the other the copyright on the bible has long since expired so there nothing to stop people from making editions that do whatever wierd thing they want however the editions that are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from a variety of backgrounds with lots of crosschecks i could imagine one of the lesser known editions claiming to have fixed up all inaccurate data and inconsistencies but if so it s not any edition that s widely used the widely used ones leave the text as is weeeeelllllll almost as is it s been alleged that a few translations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize inconsistencies because translation is not an exact science there are always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best i m afraid clh

re question jesus alone oneness regarding jesus only believers our moderator writes there may be some misunderstanding over terms here i agree quite likely actually i believe jesus only originally was in the context of baptism these are folks who believe that baptism should be done with a formula mentioning only jesus rather than father son and holy spirit this may have doctrinal implications but as far as i know it does not mean that these folks deny the existence or divinity of the father i m not the right one to describe this theology and in fact i think there may be several including what would classically be called monophysite or arian two rather different views as well as some who have beliefs that are probably consistent with trinitarian standards but who won t use trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply because it is not biblical clh not biblical what then can they make of the end of matthew and jesus came and said to them all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me go therefore and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit and teaching them to obey everything that i have commanded to you and remember i am with you always to the end of the age other ancient authorities add amen nrsv the notes give no sense that this is emended do other texts contradict this regarding baptism or is a misunderstanding of the trinity the most likely explanation after all but maybe i simply misunderstand their views is anyone else out there forced to read this group with both a good bible and an unabridged dictionary christianity really is an education in itself david r tucker kg s drt athena mit edu arrgggghhhh when i talked about people who rejected trinitarian language as unbiblical i was speaking of trinitarian theology things like one essense and three persons obviously the three fold baptismal formula is biblical as you point out i normally use the term three fold in referring to mat while it is certainly consistent with belief in the trinity the trinity is a doctrine whose full formulation occurred in the th and th cent s it s unlikely that mat had in mind the fully developed trinitarian doctrine indeed the three fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do not believe in the trinity the disagreement over baptismal formulae occurs because of passages such as acts which command baptism in the name of jesus there are a couple of other passages in acts as well this leaves us with sort of a problem we re commanded in mat to baptize in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit and in acts to baptize in the name of jesus jesus only groups baptize in the name of jesus they consider this consistent with mat because they say that jesus is the name of the father the son and the holy spirit i m not the right one to ask to explain what this means i will simply say that it does not appear to be normal trinitarian theology it is also an odd way of dealing with the idiomatic phrase in the name of those who use the three fold formula don t seem to have a standard answer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of jesus i suspect that the most common explanation is to say that in the name of need not be a verbal formula to say that you baptize in the name of jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under jesus authority in the st cent context it contrasts christian baptism with the baptism of john or other jewish baptism of course there s a certain parallelism between these passages that suggests that we could just as well say that mat doesn t require the specific three fold formula to be used in baptism but simply characterizes baptism done by those who follow the father son and holy spirit one might well suspect that in the early church more than one baptismal formula was used so long as we consider following jesus to be the same as following the father son and holy spirit no great damage would be done by such a difference this does not mean that i think we should go back to using both formulae baptism is one of the few things that almost all christian groups now recognize mutually so i do not think doing something to upset that would be in the interests of the gospel this is reinforced by the fact that those groups that actually use in the name of jesus now do seem to have in mind a difference in doctrine but as i ve said before i m not the one to explain what their doctrine is clh

re the arrogance of christians dean and i write lots and lots about absolute truth and arrogance vbv r d eeap cwru edu virgilio dean b velasco jr writes i strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here which is why i deign from commenting much further i agree that we ll probably never agree and i m starting to feel frustrated and i m tired of having my conversations with my husband dominated by this topic just kidding i do have to say though that participating in this discussion has been a good learning experience for me my views on this topic have evolved and clarified through this and i suspect that we may not disagree as much as we think i admit that i m strongly prejudiced against evangelical christianity and i may not always be rational in my reactions to it i grew up in ec and went to an ec college it was definitely the wrong place for me and i react strongly to any implication that ec or conservative christianity has any sort of stronghold on true christianity i shudder when i remember the condescending attitude i had about other christians who didn t adhere to the ec model i have come to see that my real objection to this whole notion of absolute truth is the actions i have seen it lead to i have had some very bad experiences with evangelical christians claiming to know the truth and judging me or others based on their belief that they have the answers knowing the truth doesn t seem to leave a whole lot of room for others opinions i can accept your belief in absolute truth as long as you don t try to use that belief to try to force others to comply with it and you are very careful that you don t hurt others with it love your neighbor seems to go totally out the window when one knows the truth and believes that everyone should be living by that truth other people have convictions about the truth every bit as strong and sincere as yours based on careful searching prayer and their relationship with god don t dismiss them because god didn t lead them to the same conclusions as yours this is not directed personally at you dean carol alvin caralv auto trol com

was jesus black the people who post to this particular newsgroup are either too cowardly too arrogant or too apathetic to discuss this issue since i have yet to see any discussion grace my computer screen while it holds particular interest to the african american community everyone has something to gain from discussing it as any knowledgable person should know christianity has been used in this country to tighten the spiritual emotional mental hold slavery placed on the minds souls hearts of african americans this was most effectively done by the display of white icons of jesus in slave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners it wasn t enough that the slaveowner was your provider but he was also your god to be looked upon with unconditional love loyalty and to be worshipped with great pride but how culturally biblically accurate are these icons pictures statues of a black jesus have been found in european countries as that of a black madonna but what about biblical physical descriptions of jesus his hair being compared to that of wool his feet to that of brass and think about the area of the world where all biblical actions took place i welcome all intelligent commentary on this important topic flamers need not reply sherlette p s i expect at least this type of response it doesn t matter what color his skin was his actions what he did for mankind are what counts this is true i am not questioning this but he walked the earth for decades as a human this part of his existence intrigues me and as for saying that it doesn t matter to a member of a physically emancipated people who is still struggling for mental emancipation believe me it matters the general attack on the members of this group seems unjustified there has been discussion of this issue in the past we can t discuss everything at once so the fact that some specific thing hasn t been discussed recently shouldn t be taken as a sign of general cowardice arrogance or apathy in past discussions no one has been outraged by suggestions that jesus could be black and it has been suggested by a few scholars but the concensus is that he was most likely semitic as you probably know there is a tradition that portrayals of jesus in art tends to show him as one of the people thus you wouldn t be surprised to find african art showing him as black and oriental art showing him as oriental there are good reasons relating to christian devotion to think of him in such a way it s also good now and then to have that image challenged and to think of jesus as being a member of xxx where xxx is the group you least respect clh

could anyone answer this question i ve heard it said that the accounts we have of christs life and ministry in the gospels were actually written many years after the event about years or so is this correct if so why the big time delay i know all scripture is inspired of god so the time of writing is i suppose un important but i still can t help be curious ivan thomas barr contact me at u athmail causeway qub ac uk the gospels aren t dated so we can only guess luke s prolog is about the only thing we have from the author describing his process the prolog sounds like luke is from the next generation and had to do some investigating there are traditions passed down verbally that say a few things about the composition of the gospels there are debates about how reliable these traditions are they certainly don t have the status of scripture yet scholars tend to take some of them seriously one suggests that mark was based on peter s sermons and was written to preserve them when peter had died or way about to die one tradition about matthew suggests that a collection of jesus words may have been made earlier than the current gospels in the ancient world it was much more common to rely on verbal transmission of information i think many people would have preferred to hear about jesus directly from someone who had known him and maybe even from someone who studied directly under such a person rather than from a book thus i suspect that the gospels are largely from a period when these people were beginning to die scholars generally do think there was some written material earlier which was probably used as sources for the existing gospels establishing the dates is a complex and technical business i have to confess that i m not sure how much reliance i d put on the methods used but it s common to think that mark was written first around ad and that all of the gospels were written by the end of the century a few people vary this by a decade or so one way or the other clh

re when are two people married in god s eyes to recapitulate a bit the essence of marriage is two people s commitment to each other if two people claim to be married in their hearts but are not willing to have the marriage recognized by church and state that s prima facie evidence that the commitment isn t really there there are obvious situations in which christian marriage is possible without a civil or church wedding if you re stranded on a desert island or if your state forbids the marriage for an unjust reason e g laws against interracial marriage the legal concept of common law marriage is meant to ensure that the state will recognize marriages that did not start out with the usual ceremony and record keeping pastorally i m concerned that people should not use being married in god s eyes as an excuse for living together without a formal wedding one has a duty to have one s marriage properly recorded and witnessed but there are also people who have been through a wedding ceremony without making a genuine commitment and therefore are not married in god s eyes right michael a covington associate research scientist artificial intelligence programs mcovingt ai uga edu the university of georgia phone athens georgia u s a amateur radio n tmi i think the last statement is dangerous i believe as long as someone has formally undertaken the responsibility of marriage they have a moral obligation even if their intention was not right other people are involved in the marriage covenant if they believed in good faith that a marriage occurred then i think there are obligations created to them of course there are situations where intent can cause a marriage not to exist the classic example is when it s done as part of a play but these are exceptions and should be clear to all parties clh

re atheists and hell we look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come nicene constantinopolitan creed i always took the resurrection in this statement to mean the resurrection of the soul but i guess resurrection does strictly mean the raising of the physical body i have some questions on this point the next time you go to church you can check the better creed that is the apostles creed it says the resurrection of the body should have learned that on the first go around but what s a body without a little bit a soul i always thought that christians believe the descent into hell was pretty much immediate and that there are people burning in hell right now where will my soul which by the way i don t believe in exist until that time at the risk of offending everybody i will interject the th century point of view christ descended immediately into the bosom of abraham to set captives captive he preached to the saved for three days before drawing them with him back to this earth i m no expert on this part but matthew says about the death of jesus tombs were opened and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised and coming forth from the tombs after his resurrection they entered the holy city and appeared to many nab regarding the hell of the damned of which you speak christ did not see it ps acts although it saw him cf is concerning the abodes of the dead i don t want to subject my brethren to further anguish so i will direct you to contact me through e mail if you are genuinely concerned will the new body i will have be created out of the same atoms that my body now is made of or will it be built from scratch your new body might be something like adam s before his fateful encounter with the just one acts cr trans vulgate filled with infused knowledge absent of concupiscence and immortal it would probably be a little glorified too since i will have a physical body i assume it will need a physical place to exist in where is this hell in the center of the earth do you think we could find it if we dig i wouldn t recommend it it s really hot down at the center of the earth you know the normal geothermal gradient and all that regards boundary the catechist no teneis que pensar que yo haya venido a traer la paz a la tierra no he venido a traer la paz sino la guerra mateo vulgata latina
re the arrogance of christians in article apr athos rutgers edu aa freenet carleton ca mark baker writes i am asking you to believe in things not visible i don t know if this is believeing blindly or not i m not sure how blindness comes into it i do not deny reason indeed i insist upon it but reason only draws conclusions from evidence if you decide in advance that your reason will act only on the evidence of the five physical senses then you cut reason off from any possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere beyond the rather provocative if inconclusive conclusion that the physical sphere is not self explanatory so your are saying to rely on our feelings and experiences since this is the only other source of information left to us how can you then convince somebody that your feelings and experiences are the correct ones then if you can t show somebody visible and measurable effects if my experiences say that there exists no god and yours says there does where does that leave us since we are only going on experiences then both of us are correct within our own personal realities furthermore the trouble with feelings and experiences is that they can lead you astray as the tragic outcome of waco illustrates i am sure that many of koresh s followers really believed in him but i think that you and i will agree that they were being misled finally how on earth do you come to the conclusion that the physical sphere is not self explanatory when you only rely on the five senses christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence which they call faith and which is a gift of god that is this evidence is the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself the evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists reasoning on the evidence of the senses won t help either but christians do reason of the evidence of faith and do claim that this evidence is wholly consistent with the evidence of the other senses and indeed that the evidence of these other senses is part of god s revelation of himself to us you must be using a definition of evidence that i am not familiar with to me evidence is something you can show others unambiguously that what you are saying is true however i agree with you that belief in a diety is a matter of faith it is not something you can share around others must experience it independantly unfortunately as i have explained above this puts belief down to a matter of experience my impression is that christians do not have the monopoly on reason evidence and faith as far as any of these things can go in a previous article phs d vaxc cc monash edu au says you are right that science and reason cannot prove anything however if we do not use them we can only then believe on faith alone and since we can only use faith why is one picture of god e g hinduism any less valid than another e g christianity faith as i have said is not opposed to reason it is simply a new source of evidence on which reason may operate it is clear that human beings have many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses and similarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by faith religious believers in general and christians in particular use reason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding of the evidence provided by faith science claims with good reason to be the most valid system for explaining the physical universe and christianity claims also with good reason to be the most valid system possessed of the best evidence for explaining gods revelations of himself to man at the risk of repeating my argument as i have explained previously the trouble is that moslems buddhists jews etc will all say that they claim with good reason to be a valid system possessed of the best evidence for explaining gods revelations to man for buddhists it should read for explaining the non existence of god so not only must you prove your own case you have to disprove theirs alt messianic is a good place to see people strong in the belief of their own faiths and with their own good reasons if you doubt that christians use reason read this newsgroup for a while and you will see rational debate aplenty i know that all people can use reason i never claimed that they don t i just wish to make sure that their arguments are well founded it goes without saying that if i make a blunder that i expect people to correct me once we have all gone through this process of removing the non essential and contradictory bits we should hopefully have made some progress towards the truth mark baker the task is not to cut down jungles but aa freenet carleton ca to irrigate deserts c s lewis don lowe department of physics monash university melbourne victoria australia

re harrassed at work could use some prayers well i ll email also but this may apply to other people so i ll post also i ve been working at this company for eight years in various engineering jobs i m female yesterday i counted and realized that on seven different occasions i ve been sexually harrassed at this company i dreaded coming back to work today what if my boss comes in to ask me some kind of question your boss should be the person bring these problems to if he she does not seem to take any action keep going up higher and higher sexual harrassment does not need to be tolerated and it can be an enormous emotional support to discuss this with someone and know that they are trying to do something about it if you feel you can not discuss this with your boss perhaps your company has a personnel department that can work for you while preserving your privacy most companies will want to deal with this problem because constant anxiety does seriously affect how effectively employees do their jobs it is unclear from your letter if you have done this or not it is not inconceivable that management remains ignorant of employee problems strife even after eight years it s a miracle if they do notice perhaps your manager did not bring to the attention of higher ups if the company indeed does seem to want to ignore the entire problem there may be a state agency willing to fight with you check with a lawyer a women s resource center etc to find out you may also want to discuss this with your paster priest husband etc that is someone you know will not be judgemental and that is supportive comforting etc this will bring a lot of healing so i returned at only to find that ever single person had already left for lunch they left at or so no one could be bothered to call me at the other building even though my number was posted this happens to a lot of people honest i believe it may seem to be due to gross insensitivity because of the feelings you are going through people in offices tend to be more insensitive while working than they normally are maybe it s the hustle or stress or i ve had this happen to me a lot often because they didn t realize my car was broken etc then they will come back and wonder why i didn t want to go this would tend to make me stop being angry at being ignored and make me laugh once we went off without our boss who was paying for the lunch for this reason i hope good mr moderator allows me this latest indulgence well if you can t turn to the computer for support what would we do signs of the computer age in closing please don t let the hateful actions of a single person harm you they are doing it because they are still the playground bully and enjoy seeing the hurt they cause and you should not accept the opinions of an imbecile that you are worthless much wiser people hold you in great esteem darin johnson djohnson ucsd edu luxury in my day we had to make do with bytes of swap

re doing the work of god desiree bradley desiree bradley mindlink bc ca wrote the next sunday the sermon was about joshua where the israelites take jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there except for rahab who had sheltered the spies with those reports about bosnia in my mind i felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that the massacre the one in joshua was right but what really bothered me was that if i was going to try taking christianity seriously i shouldn t be so troubled about the reports of ethnic cleansing in bosnia certainly my sympathies shouldn t be with the moslims considering that the bosnian muslims are descendants of christians who under turkish rule converted to islam could the serbs be doing god s work perhaps it would be useful to ask whether those doing the ethnic cleansing could be said to be loving those they are killing in the very act of killing does it reflect the attitude of god who sends rain to both the just and the unjust if not then christians should be uncomfortable with it jesus gave his followers the law of love to follow and it is by exhibiting this that disciples will be known doctrinal or political correctness is not the standard so i don t see why christians should be moved against the serbs because their ancestors converted from christianity to islam it seems to me that as a christian you should be troubled by the ethnic cleansing peace scott shalkowski scott arts uwa edu au

re the arrogance of christians why do we follow god so blindly have you ever asked a physically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog the answer is quite simple the dog can see and the blind person cannot of course you may ask if i cannot trust my own senses how do i know whether what i see and hear about god is truth or a lie that is why we need faith to be saved we must force ourselves to believe that god knows the truth and loves us enough to share it with us even when it defies what we think we know why would he have created us if he did not love us enough to help us through this world seems to me if you learned to differentiate between illusion and reality on your own you wouldn t need to rely on doctrines that need to be updated my experience of christianity years is that most christians seek answers from clergymen who have little or no direct experience of spiritual matters and that most of these questions can be answered by simple introspection most people suspect that they cannot trust their senses but few take the next step to figure out that they can trust themselves not to get too esoteric but it seems that most religions christianity included are founded by particularly intuitive people who understand this stuff deleted as for you no one can convert you you must choose to follow god of your own will if you are ever to follow him all we as christians wish to do is share with you the love we have received from god if you reject that we have to accept your decision although we always keep the offer open to you if you really want to find out why we believe what we believe i can only suggest you try praying for faith reading the bible and asking christians about their experiences personally and what if the original poster pixie is never converted does it make sense that she or i or the majority of humanity for that matter would go to hell for eternity as many christians believe it makes more sense to me that rather than be converted to a centuries old doctrine that holds no life for her that she simply continue to decide for herself what is best you may be right about christians relying on clergy but i have some reason to hope you re not protestants emphasize conversion experience of the holy spirit and use of the bible this is intended to make sure that christians have religious experience of their own and that they have some basis on which to judge claims of clergy and other christians i can t speak for catholics and orthodox but i believe they also attempt to avoid having members who simply repeat what they are told i admit that this isn t always successful we certainly see young people join our church because at that age parents expect it but most of our members do seem quite able and willing to make judgements for themselves and have a commitment that comes out of their own experience unfortunately it s the nature of usenet that doctrinal disagreements get emphasized so it looks like we spend most of our time dealing with doctrine that s certainly not my experience of the way christians really live clh

re re does god love you in article apr athos rutgers edu jayne mmalt guild org jayne kulikauskas writes i am uncomfortable with the tract in general because there seems to be an innappropriate emphasis on hell god deserves our love and worship because of who he is i do not like the idea of frightening people into accepting christ and yet jayne as we read the gospels and in particular the topics that jesus himself spoke on hell figures in a large of the time certainly more than heaven itself paul as we learn in i thess taught new believers and new churches eschatology and did not hesitate to teach hell and damnation rev chapter is very specific and cannot be allegorized i think the word throne is used times in rev and that the unbelieving come to receive the assignment of the severity of judgement for in john we read that they are already judged rom speaks that every mouth will be shut there is no recourse excuse or defense i see evangelism as combining a way of living that shows god s love with putting into words and explaining that love preaching the gospel without living the gospel is no better than being a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal yes i agree with you life is often like a pendulum where it swings to extremes before stopping at moderation i think we have seen the extreme of the hell fire brimstone preacher but also we have seen the other extreme where hell not talked about at all for fear of offending someones sensibilities i forget who founded the word of life ministries but i remember him telling a story he was in a small town hardware store and some how a man got to the point of telling him that he didn t believe in satan or hell he believed everybody was going to heaven it was at this point that the man was asked to pray to god that he would send his children to hell of course the man wouldn t do it but the point was made many people say they don t believe in hell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it doesn t exist if this man had he would of prayed the prayer because hell didn t exist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered and yet they walk as if they believe they will never be sent there i d use a different illustration however i have to include myself in it when i watch say a basketball go bulls game and i see a blatant foul that isn t called oi vey what s with that ref that he didn t make that call it s unfair and just so in life righteousness demands payment as the surgeon takes knife in hand to cut the cancer away so god cuts off that which is still of the old creation we must preach the gospel in all its richness which includes the fact that if you reject the way and the truth and the life then broad is the way to distruction here s a question how many of you are christians because you are afraid of going to hell how many are responding to god s love i think i would fall in there somewhere actually it was both after all repentance isn t only a turning towards but also a turning away from no again if jesus used it in his ministry then i can surely see that we should do it also in love of course but in truth most assuredly i have thought about writing something on this topic but not now and here i would say that there are some good reasons for its existence and its eternality god is light yes he is love but his love has the boundary of holiness dignity of man either a man is a robot or he is a responsible creature if responsible then he is also accountable the awfulness of sin today we have a poor poor concept of sin god christ he was willing to die and go there himself to offer an avenue to the whosoever will rex
major views of the trinity with frank s permission i have added some information here and in one case changed the order of his contributions in order to clarify the historical relationship of the views my comments are based primarily on william rusch s historical summary in the trinitarian controversy fortress i m going to save this as an faq clh major views of the trinity second century the writers of the nd cent are important because they set up much of the context for the later discussions justin martyr aristides athenagoras tatian and theophilus of antioch are known as the apologists their theology has often been described as logos theology based strongly on wording in john they took more or less a two phase approach through eternity the logos was with the father as his mind or thought this immanent word became expressed as god revealed himself in history ultimately in jesus thus jesus full distinction from the father only became visible in history though the logos had been present in god from eternity rusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the final orthodox position but in a form which is less sophisticated because it did not have the technical language to properly deal with the eternal plurality in the godhead irenaeus held views somewhat similar to the apologists however he was uncomfortable with the two stage approach he still viewed god as one personage with distinctions that did not become fully visible except through his process of self revelation the economy the distinctions are present in his essential nature irenaeus emphasized the holy spirit more than the apologists irenaeus views should probably be called economic trinitarianism though that term is normally used as below to refer to later developments third century clh

the son and the holy spirit therefore are consubstantial with the father s divine essence only as impersonal attributes the divine dunamis came upon the man jesus but he was not god in the strict sense of the word perception of god s subsistence the notion of a subsistent god is a palpable impossibility since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible the diversity of god is apparent and not real since the christ event and the work of the holy spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within god not to a hypostatic union asignation of deity eternality father unique originator of the universe he is eternal self existent and without beginning or end son a virtuous but finite man in whose life god was dynamically present in a unique way christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified holy spirit an impersonal attribute of the godhead no deity or eternality is ascribed to the holy spirit criticism s elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation concerning the trinity categorically denies the deity of christ and of the holy spirit thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical doctrine of salvation in summary this probably best thought of as not being trinitarianism at all god is an undifferentiated one son and holy spirit are seen as simply names for the man jesus and the grace of god active in the church clh modalistic monarchianism source praxeas adherents noatus sabellius swedenborg scleiermacher united pentecostals jesus only perception of god s essence the unity of god is ultra simplex he is qualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person this essence may be designated interchangeably as father son and holy spirit they are different names for but identical with the unified simplex god the three names are the three modes by which god reveals himself perception of god s subsistence the concept of a subsistent god is erroneous and confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of god s modalistic manifesting of himself the paradox of a subsisting three in oneness is refuted by recognizing that god is not three persons but one person with three different names and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama asignation of deity eternality father fully god and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of the only unique and unitary god son full deity eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another mode of the one god and identical with his essence he is the same god manifested in temporal sequence specific to a role incarnation holy spirit eternal god only as the tile designates the phase in which the one god in temporal sequence manifested himself pursuant to the role of regeneration and sanctification criticism s depersonalizes the godhead to compensate for its trinitarian deficiencies this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical its concept of successive manifestations of the godhead cannot account for such simultaneous appearances of the three persons as at christ s baptism rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy there are actually two slightly different groups included noetus and his followers and sabellius noetus was apparently more extreme sabellius followed him and attempted to use some features of economic trinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view unfortunately information about sabellius comes from a century later and there seems to be some confusion between him and marcellus of ancyra clh i ve moved the following description to be with the other third century views it originally appeared near the end clh economic trinitarianism source hippolytus tertullian adherents various neo economic trinitarians perception of god s essence the godhead is characterized by triunity father son and holy spirit are the three manifestations of one identical indivisible substance the perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially comprehended in such manifest triadic deeds as creation and redemption perception of god s subsistence subsistence within the godhead is articulated by means of such terms as distinction and distribution dispelling effectively the notion of separateness or division asignation of deity eternality the equal deity of father son and holy spirit is clearly elucidated in observation of the simultaneous relational operational features of the godhead co eternality at times does not intelligibly surface in this ambiguous view but it seems to be a logical implication criticism s is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the relational aspect of the trinity note that this is a development of the apologists and irenaeus as mentioned above as with them the threeness is visible primarily in the various ways that god revealed himself in history however they did say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow present in the godhead from the beginning tertullian talks of the father son and holy spirit as being three that are one in substance many people regard this view as being essentially orthodox but with less developed philosophical categories clh origen developing further an approach started by clement attempted to apply neo platonism to christian thought he set many of the terms of the coming battle in platonic fashion he sees the son as a mediator mediating between the absolute one of god and the plurality of creating beings the son is generated but he is eternally generated that is the relationship between father and son is eternal it cannot be said that there was once when he was not a phrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries having the son is intrinsic to his concept of god the father and son are described as separate hypostases though this may not have quite the meaning of separate subsistence that it had in some contexts the union is one of love and action but there is some reason to think that he may have used the term homoousios of the same substance the holy spirit is also an active personal substance originated by the father through the son origen s intent is trinitarian not tritheistic but he pushes things in the direction of separateness fourth century clh subordinationism often called arianism clh source arius major adherents modern jehovah s witnesses and several other lesser known cults perception of god s essence the inherent oneness of god s nature is properly identifiable with the father only the son and the holy spirit are discreet entities who do not share the divine essence perception of god s subsistence the unipersonal essence of god precludes the concept of divine subsistence with a godhead threeness in oneness is self contradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic god asignation of deity eternality father the only one unbegotten god who is eternal and without beginning son a created being and therefore not eternal though he is to be venerated he is not of the divine essence holy spirit a nonpersonal noneternal emanation of the father he is viewed as an influence an expression of god deity is not ascribed to him criticism s it is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting the deity of both christ and the holy spirit its hierarchial concept likewise asserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the father christ and the holy spirit this results in a totally confused soteriology note also that in most versions of this view the son is not fully human either he is supernatural and sinless that distinguishes this view from adoptionism clh orthodox trinitarianism source athanasius adherents basil gregory of nyssa gregory of nazianzus augustine thomas aquinas luther calvin contemporary orthodox christianity perception of god s essence god s being is perfectly unified and simplex of one essence this essence of deity is held in common by father son and holy spirit the three persons are consubstantial coinherent co equal and co eternal perception of god s subsistence the divine subsistence is said to occur in three modes of being or hypostases as such the godhead exists undivided in divided persons this view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation in function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the godhead asignation of deity eternality in its final distillation this view unhesitatingly sets forth father son and holy spirit as co equal and co eternal in the godhead with regard to both the divine essence and function criticism s the only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in human language and thought itself the impossibility of totally describing the ineffable mystery of three in oneness at least in the th cent there were several different approaches all of which fit the description here and all regarded as orthodox but which are somewhat different in detail nicea was originally held to respond to arius arius can be thought of as carrying origen s thought a bit too far to the point of making the son a separate entity in general the east tended to take an approach based on origen s and it was hard to get acceptance of nicea in the east its final acceptance was based on the work of athanasius with the cappadocians gregory of nyssa and gregory of nazianzus among others while starting with three they show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one must think of them as being a single god this allowed the council of constantinople in to get wide agreement on the idea of three hypostatese and one ousia clh

re doing the work of god desiree bradley desiree bradley mindlink bc ca asked us whether we should think of the serbs as doing god s work in bosnia i ve refrained from posting in hope that someone who is more familiar with the ot than i would answer but at this point i feel i have to say something many things about this posting bother me i know of not the slightest suggestion in the nt that christians should use force to propagate the gospel and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death of moslems violates the heart of the gospel christ died to break down these distinctions in him there is neither jew nor greek there is neither slave nor free there is neither male nor female if moslems do not know him we may preach to them but we don t kill them furthermore the attack is between states not religions there are christians being attacked as well one of the towns under attack is one of the few places where christians and moslems are living together peacefully the precedents being suggested are from the ot there are in fact two different things being alluded to the first is from the entry into canaan for that to be a parallel we would need for god to have promised this land through a prophet and we would need the war to be a holy war there were tight constraints on behavior in those attacks any violations were likely to cause the israelites to be defeated rape would not have been tolerated while the accounts in joshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed note that it was possible for a town to make peace with the israelites and that once that was done even when deception was involved they were expected to honor it in contrast there have been many violations of agreement in this incident i see no evidence that god has granted bosnia to the serbs as a promised land and if he had their behavior would have disqualified this from being a holy war the other ot parallel is from later when israel was defeated by assyria and babylonia the prophets saw this as a judgement on israel for her sins someone asks whether we shouldn t see this as a judgement on the bosnians for their sins this sounds like a replay of the old claim that we shouldn t have doctors or hospitals because illness is god s judgement yes even bad things may be used by god for good that includes actions of bad people but that doesn t justify them if you read the prophets you find them very clear that in attacking israel the assyrians and babylonians were acting as unintentional agents of god their intent was to attack god s people and they would be judged for it the fact that they were actually carrying out god s plan didn t excuse their action furthermore we shouldn t conclude from this that all attacks are judgements from god god explicitly interpreted that case through his prophets as far as i know he did not send any prophets to bosnia while i find it hard to see any good in the current fighting i am sure god will eventually make good come out of bad but that doesn t justify it and it won t save the people who are doing it from judgement i am particularly concerned about the implications of this issue because of current tensions between the west and moslem oriented nations what we do not need is for moslems to conclude that christians think it s ok to kill moslems the implications for the mid east and even relations with american moslems could be quite serious

re help i m a commited christian that is battling with a problem i know that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds yet hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless saying you fools do you still think that just believing is enough stuff deleted now i am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone not what you do as taught in romans but how can i square up in my mind the teachings of james in conjunction with the lukewarm christian being spat out can anyone help me this really bothers me will there has been a lot of discussion going on about this over in s r c b s i will make the case here though and try to help you out for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast ephesians yes it is by god s grace and our faith that we are saved we are not saved by what we do however if ye love me keep my commandments john keeping christ s commandments is a work per se and a demonstration of our love for him also he spake also this parable a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came and sought fruit thereon and found none then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard behold these three years i come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none cut it down why cumbereth it the ground and he answering said unto him lord let it alone this year also till i shall dig about it and dung it and if it bear fruit well and if not then after that thou shalt cut it down luke again ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you john it is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit what is that fruit well paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being love joy peace patience etc all of these are things that are manifest in the actions that we carry out if a person claims to believe in jesus christ but does not do the things christ commanded i dare say that they really don t have any faith asking which is more important faith or works is like asking which blade on a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your pants is more important good works should come out of and be a result of our faith to have faith true faith in christ requires you to do what he commands the parable above speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit christs commands are actions and if we don t do those actions and produce fruit then we shall be uprooted just like the tree it is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it actions prove our faith and show the genuineness of it i can sit and talk for days about the fact that i have so much faith in my ability to jump off a building and not hit the ground in other words i can sit and tell you all day long that i have faith in my ability to fly i really don t have that faith though unless i am willing to jump off the roof and take the test words and talk mean nothing i could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to i will but this should be sufficient hope it helped jon sig file broken please try later
re being right about messiahs in article geneva rutgers edu desiree bradley mindlink bc ca desiree bradley writes i must have missed the postings about waco david koresh and the second coming how does one tell if a second coming is the real thing unless the person claiming to be it is obviously insane first by his fruits the messiah comes to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth he also comes to first reveal the root cause of original sin fallen nature and then provide a means to cut the connection to that original sin he also wants to create world peace based on godism the messiah s teachings will build on the foundation of the bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of god the fall of man the purpose of creation and god s providence of restoration it will also provide a foundation for the unity of all the world s religions many christians expect jesus to come on literal clouds so they may miss him when he returns just as the jewish people missed jesus years ago they are still waiting for his first coming the jewish people of that age expected elijah to come first jesus said that john the baptist was elijah but john the baptist denied that he was elijah how did this reflect on jesus later in prison john even questioned who jesus was is he the one who is to come or do we look for another see book of matthew i m not saying that david koresh is the second coming of christ how could somebody who breaks his word be the second coming koresh did promise that he would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radio broadcast he didn t still it seems to me that he did fool some people david koresh didn t even come close the problem is that people like this make it difficult for people to believe and trust in the real messiah when he does show up and from my meagre knowledge of the bible it seems that christians have been hard on the jews of christ s day for being cautious about accepting somebody that their religious authorities didn t accept as the messiah so i was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to be early to recognize the second coming while at the same time not wanting to be credulously believing just anybody who claims to be god very good point and perhaps the most important point of all for christians how to recognize the second coming the messiah should not claim to be god what sets a messiah apart is that he is born without original sin he is not born perfect but achieves perfection after a period of growth adam and eve were born sinless but they fell and this tragedy meant that it would take god thousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as god originally intended god s restoration providence is still not complete the messiah is the true son of god one with god god s representative on the earth but not god himself there is only one god mark and then if any one says to you look here is the christ or look there he is do not believe it mark and then they will see the son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory my understanding of jesus answer is that unlike his first coming which was veiled the second coming will be quite unmistakeable by the way from koresh s public statement it s not so clear to me that he is claiming to be christ who else in this world is claiming to be the messiah maybe he s already here mike

re assurance of hell in article apr geneva rutgers edu lfoard hopper virginia edu lawrence c foard writes and many others mailed me here is a reply to one of the letters seems to me that atheist do not like the doctrine of hell there s nothing like a preacher to put fear into an ignorant man if god hadn t created hell in the first place there d be no no need to die and save us isn t it also a bit paradoxical to say god died when in fact no such thing is remotely possible can the infinite die your using th century concepts to interprete st century writers of course in your termonology god could not cease to exist however that is not what death ever means in the scriptures if you will study the word you will see that it signifies separation death is separation not ceastation this is the reason for the agony of the cross for the first time in eternity one member of the godhead was separated from the other two i once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived she was as personable as any saint ever imagined she was to become my girlfriend for several years however having been drafted we were separated by distance to me that was a form of death later she decided that she couldn t wait for me to come home and bid me adue that to me was death it was separation from that which had made me whole death is separation and eternal death is eternal separation from his fellowship not because he chose to send you into outer darkness but because you chose to go there did you know that jesus talked more about hell than he did about heaven thank you for this info what respect i had for the man now has been diminished tenfold i promise never again to say how wise or loving this man was when i rebelled against my earthly father he spanked me i found no wisdom in that until i had grown older and especially until i had my own children he was trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if i continued on my suicidal course he did it in love though i interpreted it as harsh and unloving if god warns of impending danger that is love if choose to let us do as we please and then at the end tell us the rules that would be harsh you have a conscience no matter how calused or fallen it is that witnesses to you that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear being jesus was allegedly god i doubt he could honestly feel the pinpricks man dealt him this may give light to the error of your understanding one must have correct knowledge in order to have correct faith faith and knowledge are inseparable jesus most certainly felt the pinpricks of life as the scripture say heb for we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses but one who has been tempted in all things as we are yet without sin the kenosis passage of phil states that he gave up his godhead attributes when he took upon himself humanity it has been a favorite meditation of mine to think about this it was to be my phd thesis the consciousness of christ i have talked at length with a great many people about this interesting study including clh it is my conclussion that as jesus the nd member of the trinity actually suffered as we do he became part of the human race and experienced it as we do he grew in knowledge he chose not to grasp his omniscience but chose to be taught it is my understanding that he was led of the spirit to such an extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between jesus the man and jesus as god but in jn where the adulterous women was thrown before him the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took him by surprise that is he was not aware that this event was to take place in time he was living sequential history as you or i maybe some other time we can discuss this but it is a very lengthy discussion and one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than not thanks again for the info just so you know some friends and i are starting a freethinkers organization and i m going to use some of the info you provided for an organization intro duction i was once a member of that club the free thinker is a glorious ideal by contrast of course you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository of everything that is dogmatic inhibited reactionary and repressive i find such a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd if the liberal humanist wishes to criticize a christian or a buddhist or a marxist that is his right but what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his rational doubt when in fact he was led to it by his faith he must acknowledge that while it is rational doubt for him as a free thinker to criticize the christian it might equally be a rational doubt for the christian to criticize him as a humanist if there is no faith there can be no dout there is no faith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith pascal pointed out that sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive few speak dubiously of scepticism the fact that skeptics are not skeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must believe in something else the person who is skeptical toward one faith or even most faiths will be the devoted adherent of another in fact it is a measure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define himself only in negative terms hence the term a theist some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism in my campus ministry i ran across this more times than i care to remember however they disproved their own argument with every thought every word every point of logic that they used every moment of shared communication speaks against their total skepticism their very insistence of trying to make sense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent that is to say that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism is arbitrary next time you re in a room of skeptics yell out look your fly is undone each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he believes without skepticism to stress this is to belabor the obvious but it underlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he knows pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity the answer to this impasse lies in a rd way of knowing one which is based on presuppositions but if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before it is proved the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt and critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective and neutral in other words another myth presuppositions my friend it is impossible to doubt anything unless there is something we do not doubt our own assumptions presuppostions even these can be criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions presuppostitons are our silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for absence i tell you what if god condemns me for being honest he is unworthy of my worship better to burn in hell than to serve a tyrant in heaven of course that is hardly an original statement milton coined it but it had been in use for millenia it was even used in the first highlander movie but again your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of god you are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic theology not what he has revealed of himself through history through his prophets through his word and lastly but most of all thru his son if you are to reject god s annointed savior then reject him from a correct understanding of himself rex

re sabbath admissions of in article apr geneva rutgers edu clh writes re are you christian or pauline both sure why not but are you using paul to correct the words of jesus there is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is not at least not in this case jesus did not deal explicitly with the question of whether the law was binding on gentiles so anyone who dissolves even one of the smallest commands and teaches others the same way will be known as the lowest in the kingdom of the skies whereas anyone who keeps the commands and teaches them too will be known as someone great in the kingdom of the skies mat gaus are you an anyone or are you a no one why not assume that since jesus didn t say that his words apply only to jews that they apply to all human beings irregardless of race or sex why not assume that even though jesus did not mention your name still jesus was talking directly to you that s why i have to cite evidence such as the way jesus dealt with the centurion as to general jewish views on this i am dependent largely on studies of pauline theology one by h j schoeps and one whose author i can t come up with at the moment both authors are jews also various christian and non christian jews have discussed the issue here and in other newsgroups mat is clear that the law is still valid it does not say that it applies to gentiles does it say that it applies to you are you anyone or no one and yes i say that the specific requirement for worship on the sabbath in the ten commandments is a ceremonial detail when you re looking at the obligations of gentiles ex jps remember the sabbath day and keep it holy six days you shall labor and do all your work but the seventh day is a sabbath of the lord your god you shall not do any work you your son or daughter your male or female slave or your cattle or the stranger who is within your settlements for in six days the lord made heaven and earth and sea and all that is in them and he rested on the seventh day therefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and hollowed it note there is no specific requirement for worship here however i for one would not be so bold as to call these verses a ceremonial detail similarly circumcision don t many christians still practice circumcision i m not sure quite what else i can say on this subject again it s unfortunate the jesus didn t answer the question directly it s unfortunate that jesus didn t use your name directly or maybe jesus did are you somebody or nobody however we do know what the st cent jewish approach was how jesus dealt with at least one gentile and how jesus disciples dealt with the issue when it became more acute i m referring to acts more than paul given that these are all in agreement i don t see that there s a big problem if you don t see a problem then perhaps there is none as paul closes romans gaus in short pursue the ends of peace and of building each other up don t let dietary considerations undo the work of god everything may be clean but it s evil for the person who eats it in an offensive spirit better not to eat the meat or drink the wine or whatever else your brother is offended by as for the faith that you have keep that between yourself and god the person is in luck who doesn t condemn himself for what he samples on the other hand the person with doubts about something who eats it anyway is guilty because he isn t acting on his faith and any failure to act on faith is a sin as far as i know christians except specific jewish christian groups and maybe some of the sabbatarians both of which are very small groups do not practice circumcision on religious grounds in some countries it has been done for supposed health reasons but i ve not heard it argued that it is being done because of the biblical commandment clh
re the arrogance of christians in article apr geneva rutgers edu caralv caralv auto trol com carol alvin writes vbv r d eeap cwru edu virgilio dean b velasco jr writes hold it i said that all of scripture is true however discerning exactly what jesus paul and company were trying to say is not always so easy i don t believe that paul was trying to say that all women should behave that way rather he was trying to say that under the circumstances at the time the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility and cover their heads this has to do with maintaining a proper witness toward others remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derived from absolutes for instance it is absolutely right for christians to strive for peace however this does not rule out trying to maintain world peace by resorting to violence on occasion yes my opinion i agree that there is truth in scripture there are principles to be learned from it claiming that that truth is absolute though seems to imply a literal reading of the bible if it were absolute truth constant across time culture etc then no interpretation would be necessary i strongly disagree that absolute truth would not require interpretation that s because truth may be absolute but it may not be obvious like so many things the truth is always subject to misinterpretation i strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here which is why i deign from commenting much further sure the bible preaches absolute truths however exactly what those truths are is sometimes a matter of confusion as i said the bible does preach absolute truths sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal clear at least to evangelicals this is where the arrogance comes in to play since these principles are crystal clear to evangelicals maybe the rest of us should just take their word for it maybe it isn t at all crystal clear to me that their fundamental principles are either fundamental or principles now hold it i never said that christians cannot be arrogant indeed as many other christians on src have stressed before this is a trap that christians must always be wary about however this does not mean that if you believe in the absolutes established by the bible you are necessarily being arrogant a christian can believe that the word of god is absolute but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone so i think that your position is the bible is absolute truth but as we are prone to error in our interpretation we cannot reliably determine if we have figured out what that truth is did i get that right not quite you say that according to my stance we cannot reliably determine what is true that is not what i said i say that as fallible human beings we cannot discern the truth with certainty the distinction is subtle yet important when a scientist performs an experiment he can claim that his results are reliable without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could have been made in other words he can admit that he could be mistaken without sacrificing his convictions nobody can establish what absolute truth is with certainty throughout the centuries philosophers have argued about what we can know with complete certainty and what we cannot descartes made a step in the right direction when he uttered cogito ergo sum yet we have not advanced much beyond that do you believe that other people aside from you exist do you believe that the computer terminal you are using exists if so can you be absolutely certain about that are you sure it is not some grand illusion of course you have no such assurance this does not mean however that for all practical purposes you can be certain that they exist so it is with christianity the most mature christians i know have deep convictions about absolute morality yet they acknowledge that there is a non zero probability that they are wrong this does not however mean that they should or do abandon these absolutes what s the point of spending all this time claiming and defending absolute truth when we can never know what those truths are and we can never or at least shouldn t act upon them what practical difference can this make as i said we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct this does not mean that we cannot be certain enough in light of the evidence to render all doubts unreasonable virgilio dean velasco jr department of electrical eng g and applied physics cwru graduate student roboticist in training and q wannabee bullwinkle that man s intimidating a referee my boss is a not very well he doesn t look like one at all jewish carpenter
re questioning authority despite my trendy liberal feminist tendencies and the fact that i basically agree with what you are saying i will rebut dr nancy s sweetie writes chris mussack writes for all those people who insist i question authority why authorities sometimes tell people to do evil things people who just follow orders have tortured and killed others in very large numbers and protest their innocence afterwards the basic question here is how do i know what i am supposed to do this is true in every situation that comes up some people do not think about it at all and merely follow their impulses i claim that is just as dangerous as following authority i could site sexually transmitted diseases drug abuse all manner of criminal activity the savings and loan scandal car accidents eggs thrown at my house all are examples of people not following authority i could easily argue that in the evil examples you gave the problem was a leader not following his authority and doing what he wanted of course where is the top of the chain therein lies our search when your authority starts telling you to do things you should ask questions except for situations of pressing need i said shut the hatch because the submarine is filling with water any reasonable authority should be able to give at least some justification that you can understand i don t think it s as simple as you are claiming pressing need is ambiguous should i recycle or not realize that i have four kids who despite being very precocious of course are very tiring with their constant lack of understanding the tremendous knowledge i wish to impart to them just be sure to listen when authority answers ahh an ironic ending the irony i was implying in my initial pithy retort to the bumper sticker cliche question authority was that i was questioning the authority of the person telling me to question authority it seems there is a certain segment of society that finds meaning only in being different only in rebelling forsaking everything for the sake of freedom i question their integrity and fortitude there is another freedom that comes from doing a task correctly different people are at different levels of development in different areas part of the challenge of life is to find the right authorities to follow we can t know everything about everything often when learning a new skill or subject i will follow the teacher perhaps blindly only when i have learned enough to ask appropriate questions should i question him only when i have developed my skills enough should i challenge him once again how do i know when i get to those stages if you have to be told to question authority perhaps you shouldn t chris mussack a good comedian should never have to explain his jokes
re the arrogance of christians i ve just read carol s response and i just had to get into this i ve got some verses which are not subject to interpretation because they say what they say they are peter timothy and galatians also based on the fact that jesus is the word incarnate and he judges people if they follow him see acts and john and that those who reject jesus teachings are judged by the very words he spoke see john then jesus words are true and do not need interpretation nor would it be just of god to judge based on his word if it had to be interpreted joe fisher

re atheist s views on christianity was re accepting jeesus in your heart first i thank collectively all people who have given good answers to my questions in my follow up to jason smith s posting i will address some issues that have caused misunderstanding jason smith jasons atlastele com wrote in article apr athos rutgers edu kempmp phoenix oulu fi petri pihko writes i also concede that i was doubly remiss as i asserted no reasonable alternative exists an entirely subjective statement on my part and one that could be invalidated given time and further discovery by the scientist i also understand that a proving a theory does not necessarily specify that this is how it happened but proposes a likely description of the phenomena in question am i mistaken with this understanding yes to some degree there was an excellent discussion in sci skeptic on the nature of scientific work two weeks ago i hope it did not escape your notice the correct word is likely there is no way to be sure our models and theories are absolutely correct theories are backed up by evidence but not proved no theory can be true in a mathematical sense however theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of phenomena it is extremely important to test whether theories can predict something new or not yet observed all successful theories science has come up with have passed this test including the big bang theory of cosmic evolution the theory of natural selection etc it does not mean they must be correct but they are not mere best fits for the data but if you claim that there must be an answer to how did the universe our spacetime emerge from nothing science has some good candidates for an answer all of which require something we christians readily admit to faith well yes if you want to believe in them this is not what science requires take a good look at the theory and the evidence see if the theory has made any successful predictions and use your reason disbelievers are not punished the fact that there are several candidates belies that none are conclusive with out conclusive evidence we are left with faith this is what puzzles me why do we need to have faith in anything my fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist someone who is unable to believe ie fails to entertain any belief in god yes i know that one can t believe without god s help luther makes this quite clear in his letter to erasmus i m afraid this does not change my situation a couple of paragraphs deleted summary we ask why does the universe exist i think this question should actually be split into two parts namely why is there existence why anything exists and how did the universe emerge from nothing deletions the question why anything exists can be countered by demanding answer to a question why there is nothing in nothingness or in non existence actually both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning things that exist do and things that don t exist don t exist tautology at its best carefully examine the original question and then the counter question the first asks why while the second is a request for definition no it is not although it does look like one this is a true dichotomy either something exists or nothing exists if nothing exists nobody would ask why if something exists it is possible to ask why but actually no existing being could give an answer imagine for a moment that the nobodies in non existence could also ask why nothing exists this is equivalent to my counter question why nothing exists in nothingness now why anything exists is equivalent to why something exists in somethingness this is what i meant with my tautology my apologies for the poor wording in my previous post i might add the worldview of things that exist do and things that don t don t is as grounded in the realm of the non falsifiable as does the theist s belief in god it is based on the assumption that there is not a reason for being something as ultimately un supportable as the position of there being a reason its very foundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there is a reason i do indeed think there probably is no reason for being or existence in general for reasons i stated above however they will still leave open the question why this and not that and this is where theistic explanations come in science cannot give reasons for any particular human being s existence we come to this either i am therefore i am or i am for a reason this is a deep philosophical question is determinism true or not also is god deterministic or not i tend to think this question has no meaning in his case if i am for a reason i ve yet failed to see what it would be from our perspective it looks like i exist for truly random reasons i just rolled two dice why did i get and how can i believe there is any better reason for my existence if the former is a satisfactory answer then you are done for you are satisfied and need not a doctor if the latter your search is just beginning yes i am satisfied with this reason until i find something better my years of christianity were of no help in this respect i have to admit but i am patient another answer is that god is the source of all existence this sounds much better but i am tempted to ask does god himself exist then if god is the source of his own existence it can only mean that he has in terms of human time always existed but this is not the same as the source of all existence this does not preclude his existence it only seeks to identify his qualities implying he exists to have qualities btw no it doesn t but i think an existing god cannot know why he exists for an answer to this question is not knowable of course this should not be any obstacle to belief in his existence i also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer why it appears that m pihko agrees as we shall see but because a tool is inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question asserting that why is an invalid question does not provide an answer it is impossible to know unknowable things however the question why do i exist in particular is not an invalid question this is not what i said but from our perspective it is impossible to tell and i can t just believe in any given explanation instead of another especially since i found i was deluding myself my apologies i was using why as why did this come to be why did pre existence become existence why did pre spacetime become spacetime i think pre existence is an oxymoron there is no time outside of this spacetime except in some other universe and from that perspective our universe never was it exists only for those who are inside it but we come to the admission that science fails to answer why because it can t be answered in the realm of modern science does that make the question invalid no the validity of the question has to be discussed separately i think philosophy is of great help here what can be known and what is not knowable m pihko does present a good point though we may need to ask what do i as an individual christian base my faith on will it be shaken by the production of evidence that shatters our sacred cows or will we seek to understand if a new discovery truly disagrees with what god said and continues to say in his word this is a very good question in trying to answer this and numerous other questions that bothered me i finally found nothing to base my faith on i think it would be honest if we all asked ourselves why do i believe or why i don t believe petri petri pihko kem pmp

re proof of resurection in article apr geneva rutgers edu andrew srsune shlrc mq edu au andrew mcveigh writes the bible s message is that we are to love all people and that all people are redeemable it preaches a message of repentance and of giving unfortunately all people have deceitful hearts and are capable of turning this message around and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways this is also a fundamental christian doctrine andrew how i wish this were true and how i long for the day in which it will be true but alas it is not true of history the bible does not have a message it has messages and some of those are messages of repentance and giving to turn the other cheek and do unto the least of these but some of the messages are the complete opposite like the isrealites order to wipe out other tribes including women and children down to cattle and punished severely when they were less than complete about the job like jews who are said to have cried out in matthew his blood be upon our heads and our childrens heads a verse quoted in every pogrom from the crusades to the holocaust have these been misunderstood i think not they have only been understood too clearly it is essential that christians grasp firmly the good the bible teaches the meek carpenter from nazareth is a potent symbol for how we should be his teachings we must take to heart but we cannot ignore the other material in the bible which is not to our liking and say those who live by that have misread it to say that is only to chose a point of interpretation and declare it normative such can be done with the same legitmacy by anyone instead we must let the text critique the text understanding that there is both good and bad in our sacred corpus we test all things and hold fast to that which is good p s i believe that a line of questioning like you presented is strangely enough compatible with becoming a christian certainly christianity encourages one to question the behaviour of the world and especially christians i praise god for jesus christ and the fact that we can doubt our beliefs and still come back to god and be forgiven time and time again at the risk of sounding heretical well ok more heretical i don t think that doubt is something which requires forgiveness it is something which requires introspection and reflection if that is a sin then there can be no salvation for doubt is an inescapble part of being human consider job his friends had no doubt whereas job had no doubt in himself but doubted the wisdom and justice of god when god finally did appear he rebuked the friends and had job make sacrifices for them to be a christian it to always have doubt or not to have honesty randy
re the arrogance of christians i ve just read carol s response and i just had to get into this i ve got some verses which are not subject to interpretation because they say what they say joe just cause you say they aren t subject to interpretation doesn t necesarily make it so that s your interpretation of these texts they are peter timothy and galatians peter but know this first of all that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of one s own interpretation for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will but men moved by the holy spirit spoke from god the study notes in my bible offer three possible meanings for verse apparantly it s not as clear to charles ryrie as it is to you timothy all scripture is inspired by god and profitable for teaching for reproof for correction for training in righteousness that the man of god may be adequate equipped for every good work galations for i would have you know brethren that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man for i neither received it from man nor was i taught it but i receieved it through a revelation of jesus christ when i read these passages it was not immediately clear to me what every phrase meant i had stop and think about the possible connotations of words what the intent of the author may have been wonder if the translator used the correct english word to convey the same meaning i had to interpret if you want to believe that your are not interpreting scripture as you read there s probably nothing i can say to change your mind but i think it s naive to think that our culture experiences education do not affect everything we read also based on the fact that jesus is the word incarnate and he judges people if they follow him see acts and john and that those who reject jesus teachings are judged by the very words he spoke see john then jesus words are true and do not need interpretation nor would it be just of god to judge based on his word if it had to be interpreted in college i took an entire course in biblical interpretation go to any christian bookstore there are scores of books on interpreting and understanding scripture if interpretation is unnecessary there are an awful lot of misguided christians out there wasting a lot of time and energy on it carol alvin caralv auto trol com
re iterations of the bible ofm replies to a question on the multiplicity of translations of the bible as far as i know no christians believe that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of translating is free of error unfortunately this isn t true on another news group earlier this year someone posted that the king james bible was the divinely inspired version of the bible in english and was therefore inerrant all other english translations were from satan trying to deceive the body of christ a few years ago the pastor of a church i was attending showed me a poster advertising the availability of a certain man to address congregations very prominantly on the poster was the fact that the man used only the kjv the idea that the kjv is the english bible is more prevalent than many might think scott at brandeis but god demonstrates his the lord bless you and keep you own love for us in that the lord make his face shine on you while we were yet sinners and be gracious to you christ died for us the lord lift up his countenance on you and give you peace romans nasb numbers nasb
re serbian genocide work of god d andrew kille writes are you suggesting that god supports genocide perhaps the germans were punishing jews on god s behalf any god who works that way is indescribably evil and unworthy of my worship or faith the bible does tell us that governments are ordained by god romans and furthermore god foreknows everything that would happen it is just to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds the inevitablity of the sucess of god s plan and this is especially hard to grasp when we see governemnts doing evil however though they are doing evil and we should not cooperate with them when they do such it must be understood that what happens is what god wanted so as to lead to the final sucess of his plan to save as many souls from hell as is possible in short the slaughter in bosnia though deplorable in the eyes of god maybe then again they might be getting their just deserts now rather than later there are plenty of examples of god killing people for their sins onan in the old testmament for example and annias and spahira in the new is what he willed to happen so that his plan might be accomplished but don t forget it is not unbiblical for god to use one nation to execute his just judgement upon another the romans were used to fulfill the chorus of let his blood be upon our hands of the crowd in jersualem and chaldea was chastised by babylon which got israel which was inturn gotten by persia etc god does use nations to punish other nations as the bible very clearly shows in the old testament don t you remember the words of god recorded in daniel mene mene tekel peres babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of god s justice found severly wanting and was thus given over to the persians as their due punishment for their rebellion another exammple is the extirmination of the cannanites ordered by god as the task of israel the cannanites had been given their chance found severly wanting and the great judge carried out his just sentence accrodingly i could go on with more examples but i see little need to do so as my point is quite clear two things need to be remembered at all times it is not up to us to question why god has ordered the world as he has in his divine wisdom he made the world as was best in his eyes and like paul says in romans the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter the message of jesus christ is as follows repent now for the kingdom of heaven is at hand jesus christ did not allow any time for dilly dallying let the dead bury the dead come follow me there is not an infinite amount of time rather christ is passing by right now calling people to follow him and become fishers of men he does not say well alright you can call me back in a week and see if my kingdom fits in with your plans he said follow me his message is not i m just a sweety pie who would never hurt a fly you ve got all the time in the world and divine judgement that s only a fairy tale our great god and savior jesus christ titus is also the just and righteous judge of the world and it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be questioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy d andrew byler does not he who ways the heart perceive sin and will he not judge men according to their works proverbs

re christians that are not church members here are some notes about what the church is to be like and some helpful ideas about how to choose a church colossians a jesus is the head of the body the church b you cannot say yes to jesus but no to the church ephesians a the church is the family of god b the church is based on the word of god only cornerstone christ foundation apostles new testament prophets old testament see revelation corinthians a baptism is when we become a member of the church as for the question of denominations a the bible teaches that there is only one church from ephesians romans corinthians b corinthians says that there should be no divisions in the church there should be no following of personalities in the church and in time their writings c there are so many churches today because of a problem timothy says that people will turn away from the truth and try to find a church that teaches a doctrine that suits their lifestyle hebrews a do not miss church b purpose is to encourage each other so we will remain faithful involved on a relationship level in the church c must come to all services another verse which is helpful is hebrews the church should be encouraging daily as it is their duty to do of course more standards apply timothy people in the church should be watching their lives and doctrines to make sure they both live up to the word entirely ie disciples acts the pastor does not come close to the apostle paul natural conclusion since the apostle paul talked with jesus directly face to face so if the bereans who were considered noble didn t take paul at his word but checked out what he said with scripture to verify his statements then church members are to do the same and verify the pastor s statements if they are not verifiable or valid in light of other verses then that group should be avoided as a church would ve made a wonderful suggestion to the waco group especially in light of matthew joe fisher
re when are two people married in god s eyes i have a question for you all related to this jesus condemns divorce several times in the new testament and i have a hard time with this the catholic church as far as i can tell does grant annulments with the statement that the marriage never really existed in god s eyes please if i am mistinterpreting correct me however i have witnessed marriages where two people were very much in love but recognized that they were destroying themselves and each other by staying in a marriage and that the problems were due to personal childhood issues that had never been resolved i ask you is divorce justified in such a case they knew who they were what they were doing they were deeply in love but in the end it did not work out i must admit that i don t see jesus forcing them to live together or even condemning that they go and seek happiness with someone else later on opinions vera i am your clock i bind unto myself today vera noyes i am your religion the strong name of the noye midway uchicago edu i own you trinity no disclaimer what lard st patrick s breastplate is there to disclaim this is a commonly discussed question though it s been long enough that i ll allow it to be asked as you might expect there is a range of answers catholics and some others will say that divorce is never justified by the way in situations where someone is being abused or for other serious cause separation is allowed by all traditions that i know no one should be forced to stay in a situation where they are in danger others see it as a last resort in situations that have fallen apart badly enough that the best we can hope for is to choose the lesser of evils in some sense the difficult legal question turns out not to be divorce but remarriage that s because of jesus statement in mark and par as with so many other things this turns on your approach to the bible conservative protestants tend to see statements like this as having no exceptions more liberal ones are willing to make allowances for situations where a literal interpretation would lead to painful results it is noted that at the time it was possible for a man to divorce his wife almost on a whim thus a common explanation in the more liberal approach is that jesus was trying to protect people from this sort of thing not to establish an absolute rule to which there could never be exceptions catholics as is typical with catholic ethics take a theoretical hard line but allow for exceptions in practice through the process of anullment in the last discussion most of our non catholic readers seemed to accept with some reluctance that in some cases there might be no good alternative but there was a feeling that the church should often be doing a better job of helping people prepare for marriage and deal with problems that come up during it and that in a properly run church divorce should not be necessary clh

re the arrogance of christians in article geneva rutgers edu gt b prism gatech edu boundary writes dleonar andy bgsu edu pixie writes deletia sig p s if you do sincerely believe that a god exists why do you follow it blindly do the words question authority mean anything to you i defy any theist to reply deletia formalities i probably should let this pass it s not worth the time and it s not really intended for me but i couldn t resist a personal weakness of mine jerkius kneeus tragically incurable the foundation for faith in god is reason without which the existence of god could not be proven that his existence can be proven by reason is indisputable cf my short treatise traditional proofs for the existence of god and summa theologica not so i can prove that the existance of god is disputable by showing that people dispute it this is easy i dispute that god exists simple i missed your traditional proofs treatise but the proofs i remember from the summa theologic the ways i think it was were rather poor stuff the ontological argument is about a billion times better imho i would think you d want non traditional proofs considering the general failure of the traditional proofs at least the ones i know of i am thinking of the ontological argument the cosmological argument and the teleological argument those are the ones traditional enough to have funny names anyway now given that god exists and that his existence can be proven by reason i assert that his commands must be followed blindly although in our fallen condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith why this is the real question so to discuss it i ll assume god exists otherwise there is no heavenly authority to babble about because god is the first cause of all things the first mover of matter the independent thing that requires nothing else for its existence the measure of all that is perfect and the essential being who gives order to the universe logos please show this is the case i am familiar with the first cause argument and i ll accept for the sake of argument that there is a first cause even though i find some of its premices questionable the rest you ll have to show this includes that the first cause is god i next assert that god is all good got it i deny that god is all good so there if this is so then that which is contrary to the will of god is evil i e the absence of the good and since god can never contradict himself then by his promise of a savior as early as the protoevangelium of genesis god instructs that because a human adam was first responsible for man s alienation from the source of all good a man would be required to act to restore the friendship thus god became incarnate in the person of the messiah this isn t self consistent if humans must renew the relationship then god incarnate or not can t do it well unless you think god is human granted god made himself human but this is nonetheless cheating the intent of the statement is clearly that man has to fix the problem he caused god fixing it even by indirect means contradicts this now this messiah claimed that he is the truth john if this claim is true then we are bound by reason to follow him who is truth incarnate why also why assume said claim is true anyway if i claim to be truth are you bound by reason to follow me you next seem to have a problem with authority have you tried the united states marine corps yet i can tell you first hand that it is an excellent instructor in authority undoubtably do you mean to imply we should all obey the commands of the marines without question you seem to imply this about god and that the marines are similar in this respect if this is not what you are trying to say they please explain what it is you are saying as i have missed it if you have not yet had the privilege i will reply that the authority which is truth incarnate may never be questioned and thus must be followed blindly why why not question it even if it is truth we cannot know this certainly so why is it so irrational to question perhaps we will thus discover that we were wrong you assert that god is truth and we can t question truth but i assert that god is not truth and anyway we can question truth how is it my assertion is less good than yours one may not deny the truth oh i hereby deny i hope you ll agree is the truth granted i look pretty damn silly saying something like that but i needed something we d both agree was clearly true now you ll notice no stormtroopers have marched in to drag me off to the gulag no heaven lighting bolts either no mysterious net outages i seem to be permited to say such things absurd or not for example when the proverbial apple fell on isaac newton s head he could have denied that it happened but he did not the laws of physics must be obeyed whether a human likes them or not they are true they are certainly not true at least the ones newton derived are not true and are indeed wildly inaccurate at high speeds or small distances we do not have a set of laws of physics that always works in all cases if we did physics would be over already science is all about questioning this sort of truth if we didn t we d still follow aristotle i d generalize this a little more if you want to learn anything new you must question the things you know tm because you can always be wrong therefore the authority which is truth may not be denied even presupposing that truth may not be denied and may not be questioned and that god is truth it only follows that god may not be denied or questioned not that he must be obeyed we could unquestioningly disobey him how annoying of us but you have not connected denial with disobedience dan no nickname johnson and god said jeeze this is dull and it was dull genesis these opinions probably show what i know
re was jesus black this subject seems to be incredibly inflammatory those who subscribe to biblical archaeology review will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someone complained about a franklin mint ad bar is a great magazine but the contrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy ads is extreme in this ad they were hawking a doll with a head based on the famous bust of nefertiti giving the face a typical doll pink complexion the letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that nefertiti was a beautiful black queen this set off an exchange of hotheaded letters than ran for several issues to the point where they had an article from an egyptologist titled was cleopatra black the answer to the title is no she was greek i have to say that i hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining i personally have seen only one blond haired jesus in the national shrine in wash dc and i found it very jarring western representations vary enourmously but in general the image of is of a youngish male with dark hair and beard of a sort that can be found modulo the nose all up and down the mediterranean also if what i remember is correct the black madonna doesn t represent a person with negroid features it is black because of an accident joe buehler in the presence of all those marble statues one is prone to forget that greeks are rather likely to have black hair when one crosses the bosporus the situation breaks down completely are turks white how about persians or various groups in the indian subcontinent was gandhi white how about the arabs or picture nassar and sadat standing side by side and then there are the ethiopians those of a white racist bent are not likely to say that any of these people are white i e of the racist s race if i may risk a potentially inflammatory remark one undercurrent of this seems to be the identification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race considering the extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medieval antisemitism on the other i don t think that this jesus was white thesis ever played the roles that some hold it did representations of jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine it seems awfully self serving to insist that jesus belongs to one s own racial group c wingate the peace of god it is no peace but strife closed in the sod mangoe cs umd edu yet brothers pray for but one thing tove mangoe the marv lous peace of god

re did he really rise in article apr geneva rutgers edu reedr cgsvax claremont edu writes the basic problem with your argument is your total and complete reliance on the biblical text luke s account is highly suspect i would refer you to the hermeneia commentary on acts in article apr geneva rutgers edu ata hfsi hfsi com john ata writes even if there was no independent proof that luke s account was valid i find it strange that you would take the negation of it as truth without any direct historical evidence at least that you ve mentioned to back it up the assertion was made unequivocally that no christian ever sufferred for their faith by believing in the resurrection luke s account suggests otherwise and in the absence of direct eyewitnesses who can claim that luke is mistaken then i suggest that this unequivocal assertion is suspect john the problem here is that you have taken one peice of my response without bothering to connect it with the other parts i have repeatedly noted that one needs to take the problematic historcity of acts and then examine the work of john dominic crossan and burton mack once you have taken the time to examine recent developments in biblical scholarship i think you will grasp more clearly what i am saying i think the original claim may have been somewhat more limited than this it was an answer to the claim that the witnesses couldn t be lying because they were willign to suffer for their beliefs thus it s not necessary to show that no christian ever suffered for believing in the resurrection rather the issue is whether those who witnessed it did i do agree that the posting you re responding to shows that there can be liberal as well as conservative dogmatism clh certainly this is an issue as i think the situation in waco shows most clearly if all that is required is that people are willing to die for a belief for it to be true then surely david koresh is the son of god no the spurrious arguement that the resurrection had to be true for people to be willing to die must be put to rest the other problem is that it is so monologocentric even if the resurrection was a big deal which it doesn t seem to have been for either q thomas or even john to a certain degree there are a lot of other things which the early christians could have been doing together that would have been worth dying for it is my belief that even the idea of a mixed race community which brought down regional national boundaries in the name of koinonia could have been enough for people to be willing to die radical communties do that e g jonestown waco warsaw etc but my original point was that roman persecution which is the only persecution we have documented proof of was not about whether a carpenter came back from the dead such a claim was not unique nor particularly abhorent to the roman or greek mind my point is that avoidance of military and civic duty i e emperor worship would have been much more problematic which has nothing to do with the resurrection at all when nero used christians as human torches to light up his dinner party it wasn t because the believe in a risen savior it was because they were supposedly involved in incest and cannablism the argument that christians were martyred for the resurrection just cannot stand up to critical examination randy

re was jesus black jesus was born a jew we have biblical accounts of both his mother s ancestry and his father s both tracing back to david it seems reasonable to assume therefore that jesus was semitic as an interesting aside jesus being semitic makes him neither white nor black and in some sense underscores the point made earlier that his color was not important it was his message his grace and his divinity that we should concentrate on finally i would direct anyone interested in african involvement in the church to the account of the conversion of the ethiopian eunuch in acts chapter i think it s chapter this is one of the earliest conversions and the eunuch treasurer to the queen of the ethiopians was definitely african because ethiopia at that time indicated a region just south of egypt many also speculate that this man was not only the first african christian but the first black christian as well god bless charles campbell
re christians that are not church members in article gchin ssf eng sun com writes over the years i have met christians who are not associated with any local church and are not members of any local church this is an issue that may be very personal but is important what does the bible say about this and how can we encourage our friends with regard to this issue this brings up an interesting subject that has not been discussed much and probably has not been studied much as some of you may be aware i ve posted a lot of articles lately on personality typing of which the mbti is a test vehicle to come up to speed just read alt psychology personality and or ask for by personality type summary file one observation is that people have significantly different personalities no question on this which seem to be essentially in born with respect to church attendance and participation some people thrive on this while other people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a more solitary and contemplative lifestyle that is they are de energized if confronted with excessive closeness to outside activities and lots of people of course this is measured by extroversion introversion my impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact and create environments that scare away many who are naturally introverted there are many introverted characters in the bible btw i know i am quite introverted in preference and find the pressure by many churches to participate to meet together in large groups etc to be very uncomfortable knowing what i know now these churches have been overly influenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing btw there s nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion both preferences have their place in the body maybe i should define extrovert introvert more carefully since these words are usually not used correctly in our culture the extrovert introvert scale is a measure of how a person is energized the following is excerpted from my summary energizing how a person is energized extroversion e preference for drawing energy from the outside world of people activities or things introversion i preference for drawing energy from one s internal world of ideas emotions or impressions hopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches can structure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprise the body of christ instead of trying to change people s personalities to fit them into a particular framework i m sure there are other aspects of how churches have not properly understood personality variances among their members to the detriment of all jon noring charter member infj club if you re dying to know what infj means be brave e mail me i ll send info jon noring noring netcom com jkn international ip fred s gourmet chocolate carlton place phone chips world s best livermore ca v mail who are you read alt psychology personality that s where the action is
re when are two people married in god s eyes y in article apr geneva rutgers edu marka hcx ssd csd harris com mark ashley writes those with bibles on hand can give the exact chapter verse at the time jesus told peter that he was the rock he said whatever you hold true on earth is held true in heaven and whatever you don t hold true won t be true in heaven therefore with respect to marriage the ceremony has to be done by an rc priest no big parties required just the priest the couple and witnesses divorce is not allowed but anullments are granted upon approval by either the bishop or the pope not sure if the pope delegates this function maybe i m a little tired but i can t seem to follow the logic here if whatever is held true on earth is held true in heaven how is it that a priest rc only apparently is required in fact if i read the next verse correctly matthew i understand that for a marriage to take place only two are required to agree on earth touching one thing and it shall be done todd mark ashley disclaimer my opinions not harris marka gcx ssd csd harris com the lost los angelino unfortunately i haven t been able to find any completely precise statements about what is needed as usual the current edition of the catholic encyclopedia is frustratingly vague i do know that the priest is viewed as a witness and thus in some sense would not be required however part of the purpose of formal marriage is to avoid any ambiguity about who has and has not taken on the commitment the community provides support to marriage and in cases of problems are involved in helping to make sure that the people carry out as much of their commitment as possible thus marriage must be a public commitment the presence of a priest is required for a regular marriage where i m not clear is exactly where the boundaries are in exceptional cases valid but irregular ne temere says that no marriage involving a catholic is valid without a priest according to the oxford dictionary of the church and they imply that the new canon law retains this but i d rather see a more recent and authoritative source note that while a catholic priest is required for catholics the catholic church does recognize marriage between baptized non catholics as valid without a priest clh
re the arrogance of christians to what follows our moderator has already answered the charge of arrogance more ably that i could have done so so i will confine myself to answering the charge of illogic in a previous article eugene bigelow ebay sun com geno says if i don t think my belief is right and everyone else s belief is wrong then i don t have a belief this is simply what belief means unfortunatly this seems to be how christians are taught to think when it comes to their religion this is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is or was taught to think it is the fundamental premis a is not not a if a thing is true then its converse is necessarilly false without this basic asumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible we should distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word believe however the weak sense means i am not sure i believe tom went to the library but he could have gone to the track the strong sense means i am so certain that i use it as a basis of thought i believe that nature operates according to certain fundamental laws despite the fact that nature appears capricious and unpredictable christian belief is of the strong kind though christians may well hold beliefs of the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological topics some take it to the extreme and say that their religion is the only one and if you don t accept their teachings then you won t be saved note that these are two separate ideas most hold the first view but the majority do not hold the second is is again a matter of pure logic that if christanity is true then hinduism for example must necessarilly be false insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with christaianity and as a matter of logic vice versa it takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim to know what god thinks wants it is arrogant to claim to know what anyone thinks or wants unless they have told you christians believe god has told us what he thinks and wants especially when it s based upon your interpretation of a book most christians do not base their belief on the bible but on the living tradition of the church established by christ and guided constantly by the holy spirit the bible is simply the written core of that tradition the logic in the above statement is faulty in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs can t both be correct if depends what you mean by differing if i believe tom is six feet tall and you believe he weighs pounds our beliefs differ but we may both be right if i believe tom is six feet tall and you beleive that he is four foot nine one of us at least must be wrong it s all about perception no two people are exactly alike no two people perceive everything in the same way i believe that there is one truth call it god s truth a universal truth or call it what you will i don t believe god presents this truth i think it is just there and it s up to you to look for and see it through prayer meditation inspir ation dreams or whatever just because people may perceive this truth differently it doesn t mean one is wrong and the other is right thus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being can find it you assert that anyone who believe that we can find absolute truth is mistaken in short you believe that anyone who does not share your belief on this point is wrong qed as an example take the question is the glass half empty or half full you can have two different answers which are contradictory and yet both are correct so for your belief to be true does not require everyone else s belief to be wrong here i begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the knowability of truth but simply with language saying that the glass is half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half full it is the same fact expressed in different words the whole point of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist and the optimist express the same fact it is of course quite true that different people may express the same belief in different words it is also true that they may fail to understand each other s words as expressions of the same belief and may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart great scisms have occurred in just this way and much ecumenical work has been done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal agreement in belief this does not mean in any sense that all beliefs are equally valid since some of the beliefs people hold contradict some other beliefs that other people hold after all obfuscations of language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have been stripped away some of the beliefs that some people hold must necessarilly be false and it is neither arrogant nor illogical to say so if i believe x and you believe y we may both be correct but if y is equivalent to not x then one of us is wrong and as long as we hold our respective beliefs we must each regard the other as in error mark baker the task is not to cut down jungles but aa freenet carleton ca to irrigate deserts c s lewis
re was jesus black in article apr geneva rutgers edu shd andy bgsu edu sherlette dixon writes the people who post to this particular newsgroup are either too cowardly more accusations about a worldwide conspiracy against blacks since jesus was born in the middle east then i expect his human features to be similar to middle easterners at that point in time and since the camera wasn t invented yet we can only guess what he looked like for example with all the dinosaur bones we re digging up we still don t know if they were yellow polka dotted or purplish orange likewise i don t think anybody has a picture of jesus is there so our current image of jesus is our best guess okay so let s assume that jesus is black would that make you follow his techings cause if you follow his teachings skin color becomes a moot point anyway what counts more in your life your faith in jesus or his skin color as a human in the interest of historical accuracy however since jesus was from israel wouldn t his skin color be like any other jew i e fair skinned although probably heavily tanned from the desert sun experts in this area speak up cause i m not mark ashley disclaimer my opinions not harris marka gcx ssd csd harris com the lost los angelino

re when are two people married in god s eyes robert anderson randerso acad sahs uth tmc edu wrote i would like to get your opinions on this when exactly does an engaged couple become married in god s eyes some say that if the two have publically announced their plans to marry have made their vows to god and are unswervingly committed to one another i realize this is a subjective qualifier they are married joined in god s sight the way i read scripture a couple becomes married when they are physically married i e when they first have sexual intercourse e g the end of genesis quoted from memory for this reason a man shall leave his parents and be joined to his wife and they will become one flesh jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage if you read through genesis in particular you will often come across the phraseology man lay with woman and she became his wife this implies that she became his wife when they lay together i e at the point of intercourse compare this with jewish tradition joseph when he heard that mary was pregnant had it in mind to divorce her quietly but mary and joseph were betrothed not married i e they were in a binding relationship which required a divorce to get out of but marriage would not occur until mary and joseph went to bed together compare with christ and the church ephesians revelation the church is described as the bride of christ but the marriage of the lamb takes place when jesus returns i e we are in a binding love relationship with jesus but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will take place i see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse because it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and god in summary engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship but it is not marriage a civil ceremony is not marriage either marriage occurs at the point when the betrothed couple go to bed together i don t mean to demean the civil or church ceremony ours was great i don t mean to be too pedantic historically i think i am correct in stating that the civil ceremony i e a marriage recognised by the state has only been around in the west since napoleon who introduced it to keep tabs on the people although i m ready to be corrected on that point this view obviously raises some questions what about those who have had sex with one or more partners without considering marriage are those people also married if it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse is it necessary to be married in the eyes of the state i would say yes because this honours the laws of our nations in the west although it is not illegal to sleep together though unmarried in most western countries i believe that it is god honouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before actually consummating our marriage its to do with our being salt and light and also to do with how people will perceive us i e it is culturally insensitive to declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony michael davis cs mcd brunel ac uk and hast thou slain the jabberwock come to my arms my beamish boy
re certainty and arrogance responding to the moderator in article apr athos rutgers edu alvin spot colorado edu kenneth alvin writes choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal sovereignty what bothers me is when others suggest that in these matters of faith their specific beliefs are not only true to them but are absolute and should be binding on others it follows from this that god must give everyone the same revelation of truth and thus anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing the wrong path this is the arrogance i see a lack of respect for the honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and god it is certainly reasonable to ask for some humility about our own ability to know the truth there are also different paths in some areas of practice but i d like to see more clarification about what you mean when you reject the idea of saying their specific beliefs are not only true to them but are absolute and should be binding on others if something is true it is true for everyone assuming that the belief is something about god history etc yes i agree what i m trying to point out is that in matters of faith i e tenets which are not logically persuasive one may be convinced of the truth of certain things through for instance personal revelation and its certainly fine to share that revelation or those beliefs with others and i don t think that its arrogant persay to accepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself where i think the conflict arises is in assuming that where disagreements on beliefs arise all others must have been given the same truth and that god must reveal his truth to everyone in such a way that all would honestly agree i think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest that they are rejecting something they know to be truth because it is inconvenient for them or because they wish to spurn god i would say that this is equivalent to assuming that all truths one holds are universal and absolute and the problem i see with this is that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships with god this does not mean there is no absolute truth just that some areas of doctrinal disagreement may be areas where god has not established or revealed that truth comments criticism welcome ken alvin ucsu colorado edu i agree with you clh

hebrew grammar texts choose english or german greetings probably a tired old horse but maybe with a slightly different twist i wanted to know if there are any good english language texts for learning ancient hebrew and how these compare with german educational texts qualitywise if anybody has an idea i can t figure out if i should buy one here for later study or wait until i get back to the u s something i find interesting about studying theology in germany is the fact that the students get their ancient language learning out of the way early i m not a theology student but i spend a lot of time with such folks in their careers they take the first two years or so to just do greek and latin and hebrew possibly aramaic too who knows what s it like at divinity schools or seminaries in the states is there a lot of language instruction done i really don t have a basis for comparison regards phil philip sells is anything too hard for the lord k hobbes kzoo edu gen for better of worse we don t have the tradition of classical education in the u s so generally if a seminary believes students should know greek they have to teach it it s common for seminaries to require at least a semester each of hebrew and greek though of course more is required for serious scholarship clh
re cause trajan cwis unomaha edu stephen mcintyre writes norris athena mit edu writes some stuff deleted fortunately for the convenience of us believers there is a class of questions that can never be reduced away by natural science for example why does the universe exist at all must there be a why to this i ask because of what you also assume about god namely that he just exists with no why to his existence so the question is reversed why can t we assume the universe just exists as you assume god to just exist why must there be a why to the universe remainder of message deleted pardon me for replying to only a portion of your message the reason we can say god just exists and can t say the universe just exists is because the universe is a natural realm and is subject to natural laws in general and the law of cause and effect in particular that is we observe in nature that every cause has an effect and every effect was produced by a cause the existence of the natural realm as an effect itself cannot be its own cause it must therefore have a supernatural cause god on the other hand is a supernatural being and is therefore not subject to such natural laws as the law of cause and effect as a supernatural being god s eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence of a physical natural cosmos does thus those who believe in the supernatural have a valid basis for accepting the existence of uncaused phenomena such as the eternal god whereas those who deny the existence of the supernatural are faced with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very nature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existence this is of course an oversimplification of a complex topic but i just wanted to clarify some important differences between the supernatural god and the natural the universe since you seem to mistake them as being interchangeable mark

re some questions from a new christian bach udel edu steven r hoskins writes i realize i am very ignorant about much of the bible and quite possibly about what christians should hold as true this i am trying to rectify by reading the bible of course but it would be helpful to also read a good interpretation commentary on the bible or other relevant aspects of the christian faith one of my questions i would like to ask is can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological works intended for a lay person i won t even recommend books from my congregation what you ask sounds attractive but it is dangerous as a new christian you don t want to be contaminated with other people s interpretation steep your self in scripture and discuss with other christians read if your must but remember that what other people write is their interpretation god has promised to give you light so ask for it i have another question i would like to ask i am not yet affiliated with any one congregation aside from matters of taste what criteria should one use in choosing a church i don t really know the difference between the various protestant denominations don t wait too long before attaching yourself to church just remember to always compare what they teach you with scripture like the bereans did darius
when are two people married listowner i have sent this to mr anderson privately post it only if you think it of general interest here is a copy of something i wrote for another list you may find it relevant a listmember asks what makes common law marriages wrong a common law marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself there is nothing in the bible old or new testament about getting married by a preacher or by a priest jewish or christian and in fact jewish priests have never had any connection with weddings there is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the clergyman in fact the traditional christian view at least in the west is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage and that the clergyman is there only as a witness however the essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment two persons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound themselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife forsaking all others till death do them part the reason why those who have reason to be concerned about who is married to whom have always insisted on some kind of public ceremony is in order that society and the couple themselves may be clear about whether a commitment has been made suppose that we do away with the public ceremony the standard vows etc instead we have a man and a woman settling down to live together after a year or so the man says to the woman hey honey it was great while it lasted but i think it s time to move on she says what are you talking about he says i am leaving you and looking for someone prettier and younger she says but you can t we are married he says what are you talking about we never got married she says i remember distinctly what you said to me the night we first made love you said my love for you is as deep as the ocean as eternal as the stars as long as i live i am yours utterly and completely when i lie on my deathbed my last feeble breath will utter your name my he says oh that that was just rhetoric just poetry when a man is in a romantic mood he is bound to say all kinds of silly things like that you mustn t take them literally and that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that is a matter of public record the church insists on it because it is her duty among other things to give moral advice and you cannot give a man moral advice about his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is married to whom if anybody and vice versa the state insists on it since the state has a concern with property rights with child care and support and therefore needs to know who has made what commitments to whom prospective fathers in law insist on it because they don t want their daughters seduced and abandoned prospective spouses insist on it because they want to make sure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment or just poetry and persons making vows themselves insist on making them formally and publicly in order that they may be clear in their own minds about what it is that they are doing and may know themselves that this is not just rhetoric this is the real thing hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of the marriage commitment the church goes further and insists that when christians marry a clergyman shall be present at the wedding and record the vows on behalf of the church not because it is impossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman but in order to make sure that the couple understand what the christian teaching about marriage is and that they are in fact promising to be married in a christian sense the church also prefers a standard marriage vow and is wary of letting couples write their own vows for much the same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they draw up a will or a contract certain language has been repeatedly used in wills and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it try to say the same thing in your own words and you may find that the probate judge s interpretation of them is not at all what you intended similarly the church prefers to avoid endless debates about whether you are my main squeeze and i am here for the long haul do in fact cover the same territory as forsaking all others and till death do us part this topic has come up on the list before is there any topic that hasn t one listmember was asking if a couple love each other and are living together isn t that marriage in the eyes of god eventually someone asked in that case what is their status if they break up is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce are they in a relationship that god forbids either of them to walk out on the original questioner said good grief i never thought of that in fact there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that someone who says we don t need a piece of paper or a ceremony in front of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each other is trying to have it both ways to have the advantages of marriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum of bother at this point someone may say none of this applies to me and my mate we are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelong commitment for better or worse forsaking all others till death us do part so in our case no ceremony is needed to this my reply would be the reason for requiring a driver s license is to keep dangerous drivers off the road what is wrong in itself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers but the existence of dangerous drivers however testing and licensing drivers is an obvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing the number of dangerous drivers on the road therefore the state rightly makes and enforces such laws and you the citizen have a positive moral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matter how much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you are back to the original question we have a listmember who knows a couple who have been living together for around years he asks at what point did they stop fornicating and start being married i answer at the point if any where they both definitely and explicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other for better or worse as long as they both lived if they have accepted such an obligation what are their reasons for not being willing to declare it in front of

bible unsuitable for new christians a new christian wrote that he was new to the faith and learning about it by reading the bible of course i am not at all sure this is the best path to follow while the bible is for christians the word of god the revelation of god is jesus christ and the chief legacy of this revalation is the church i am not recommending any one denommination but i do recommend finding a comfortable christian congregation in which to develop your faith rather than just reading the bible this does not mean that the bible should not be read although i would stick to the gospels epistles and psalms and avoid the book of revelation altogether until you are with friends you are comfortable with i am sure that mistakenly fervent projects to read the entire bible have frequently bogged down with a remarkable lack of fervour somewhere in the middle of leviticus or for the really sturdy somewhere in chronicles the point is that the bible is their to illustrate the faith of christians but does not provide the totality of that faith vital beliefs of virtually all christians are simply not mentioned the trinity the duality of natures in christ types of church organization all these beliefs and practices have developed from the lived experience of the christian people an experience lived one hopes in the spirit as such the bible i think is better studies in the context of a congregation and the context of other reading following up on a suggestion of an old confessor of mine i would even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on the christian life most novels of any profundity are actually discussing the nature of good and evil in the human heart my own induction into the christian faith was brought about after grace through reading graham greene the power and the glory and the poetry of gerard manley hopkins i would also recommend graham greene s monsignor quixote and any novel by iris murdoch the last is not even a christian but such is her insistence on the need for the good life that frankly i often am more uplifted and god directed after reading her than after reading many parts of the bible and that after all is what being a christian is all about letting your soul and your life be in some way directed towards the infinite represented to us by the person of jesus christ paul halsall halsall murray fordham edu

re sspx schism larry l overacker writes responding to simon i may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the net my understanding is that sspx does not consider itself in schism or legitimately excommunicated but that s really beside the point what does the roman catholic church say excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication as provided for in canon law here s some of the theology involved for the interested there is confusion over this issue of the sspx s schism often the basic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between true obedience false obedience disobedience schism take the various classifications of obedience first there are important elements involved here for my purposes a command the response made to the command as far as the command goes commands can be legitimate such as the pope ordering catholics to not eat meat on fridays or they can be illegitimate such as the pope ordering catholics to worship the god dagon when every other full moon comes around as far as the response to a command goes it can be to refuse to do what is commanded or to comply making a table there are thus possibilites command response name legitimate comply true obedience illegitimate refuse true obedience legitimate refuse disobedience illegitimate comply false obedience so now you see where my classifications of obedience come from obedience is not solely a matter of compliance refusal the nature of the commands must also be taken into account it is not enough to consider someone s compliance or refusal and then say whether they are obedient or disobedient you also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad in my example if the pope commands all catholics to worship the god dagon and they all refuse they aren t being disobedient at all as far as the society of saint pius x goes they are certainly refusing to comply with certain things the pope desires but that alone is insufficient to allow one to label them disobedient you also have to consider the nature of the papal desires and there s the rub sspx says the popes since vatican ii have been commanding certain very bad things for the church the popes have of course disagreed so where are we are we in another arian heresy complete with weak popes or are the sspx priests modern martin luthers well the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what and what the traditional teaching of the church is the problem here is that very few catholics have much of an idea of what is really going on and what the issues are the religion of american catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth you will never read about the issues being discussed in the catholic press in this country on the other hand one italian catholic magazine i get days has had interviews with the superior general of the society of saint pius x many catholics will decide to side with the pope there is some soundness in this because the papacy is infallible so eventually some pope will straighten all this out but on the other hand there is also unsoundness in this in that in the short term the popes may indeed be wrong and such catholics are doing nothing to help the situation by obeying them where they re wrong in fact if the situation is grave enough they sin in obeying him at the very least they re wasting a great opportunity because they are failing to love christ in a heroic way at the very time that he needs this badly schism let s move on to schism what is it schism is a superset of disobedience refusal to obey a legitimate command all schismatics are disobedient but it s a superset so it doesn t work the other way around not all disobeyers are schismatics the mere fact that the sspx priests don t comply with the holy father s desires doesn t make them schismatics so what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a schism maybe this something else makes the sspx priests schismatics you must add this the rejection of the right to command look in any decent reference on catholic theology and that s what you ll find the distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to command here s what the catholic encyclopedia says for example not every disobedience is a schism in order to possess this character it must include besides the trangression of the commands of superiors denial of their divine right to command from the ce article schism is the society of saint pius x then schismatic the answer is a clear no they say that the pope is their boss they pray for him every day and that s all that matters as far as schism goes what all this boils down to is this if we leave aside the consideration of the exact nature of their objections their position is a legitimate one as far as the catholic theology of obedience and schism goes they are resisting certain papal policies because they think that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of the papacy and the best interests of the church in fact someone who finds himself in this situation has a duty to resist now what is the stance of rome on all this well if you read the holy father s motu proprio ecclesia dei you can find out it s the definitive document on the subject a motu proprio is a specifically papal act it s not the product of a roman congregation a letter that the pope has possibly never even read it s from the pope himself his boss is god there s no one else to complain to in this document the holy father says among other things the episcopal consecrations performed by archbishop lefebvre constituted a schismatic act archbishop lefebvre s problem was a misunderstanding of the nature of tradtion both are confusing i fail to see the logic of the pope s points as far as the episcopal consecrations go i read an interesting article in a translation of the italian magazine si si no no it all gets back to the question of jurisdiction if episcopal consecrations imply rejection of the pope s jurisdiction then they would truly constitute a schismatic act justifying excommunication under the current code of canon law but my problem with this is this according to the traditional theology of holy orders episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction it only confers the power of order the ability to confect the sacraments jurisdiction must be conferred by someone else with the power to confer it such as the pope the society bishops knowing the traditional theology quite well take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone they simply confer those sacraments that require a bishop the si si no no article was interesting in that it posited that the reason that the pope said what he did is that he has a novel post vatican ii idea of holy orders according to this idea episcopal consecration does confer jurisdiction i lent the article to a friend unfortunately so can t tell you more i believe they quoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea the pope s thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me there s no way there is a schism according to traditional catholic theology so why does the pope think this as far as the points regarding the nature of tradition goes here s the passage in question the root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete and contradictory notion of tradtion incomplete because it does not take sufficiently into the account the living character of tradition which as the second vatican council clearly taught comes from the apostles and progresses in the church with the help of the holy spirit there is a growth in insight into the realities and words that are being passed on this comes about in various ways it comes through the contemplation and study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts it comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which they experience and it comes from the preaching of those who have received along with their right of succession in the espiscopate the sure charism of truth but especially contradictory is a notion of tradition which opposes the universal magisterium of the church possessed by the bishop of rome and the body of bishops it is impossible to remain faithful to the tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond with him to whom in the person of the apostle peter christ himself entrusted the ministry of unity in his church papal motu proprio ecclesia dei july it seems to me that the holy father is making two points here that can be simplified to the following vatican council ii has happened i am the pope the argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that archbishop lefebvre must be wrong because he disagrees with them this is weak to say the least it would have helped clarify things more if the pope had addressed archbishop lefebvre s concerns in detail what is john paul ii s stand on the social kingship of christ as taught by gregory xvi pius ix leo xiii pius xi and pius xii for example are we supposed to ignore what all these popes said on the subject i don t know what the future will hold but the powers that be in the sspx are still talking with rome and trying to straighten things out many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey justified disobedience or even obeying god rather than man calling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of alice in wonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean similarly schism indicates a formal break in the church if the pope says that a schism exists it seems to me that by definition it exists it may be that the pope is on the wrong side of the break that there is no good reason for the break to exist and that it will shortly be healed but how can one deny that it does in fact exist it seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing you are trying to reform the power of the papacy what good will it do you if you become reconciled to the the pope in the future but in the process you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church discipline it s one thing to hold that the pope has misused his powers and excommunicated someone wrongly it s something else to say that his excommunication did not take effect and the schism is all in his imagination that means that acts of church discipline are not legal tools but acts whose validity is open to debate generally it has been liberal catholics who have had problems with the pope while they have often objected to church sanctions generally they have admitted that the sanctions exist you are now opening the door to people simply ignoring papal decisions claiming to be truly obeying by disobeying and to be in communion while excommunicated this would seem to be precisely the denial of divine right to command that you say defines schism clh

tuff to be a christian bissda saturn wwc edu dan lawrence bissell writes i don t think most people understand what a christian is it is certainly not what i see a lot in churches rather i think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for god s sake he loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the typical statement from an irrational and brainwashed person the bible was written by some male chavnist thousands of years ago as were all of the holy books follow the parts that you think are suitable for modern life ignore the others for heaven s sake don t take it literally same hey we can t do it god himself inspires us to turn our lives over to him that s tuff and most people don t want to do it to be a real christian would be something for the strong to persevere at but so you think it is easy to be a muslim or be a buddhist the buddha s commandments are yrs older than christ s and in my opinion tougher to follow moreover the buddha says that we are intrinsically good as against christ s we are all sinners only we allow ourselves to be distracted by meditating we can awaken ourselves etc etc also there is no concept of god in buddhism in my opinion you can be an atheist and a buddhist but to awaken yourself is no easy task can you stay away from eating meat can you sit still and think of nothing meditate for sometime everyday buddhists do or are supposed to can you pray five times a day can you fast for a month every year ramzan are you willing to give th of your income as tithe muslims do in fact i think jesus was an ordinary man just as buddha and mohamed probably with a philosopy ahead of the times where he lived considering the fact that christianity is a young religion compared to hindiusm judaism zorasterism buddihsm it is also very probable that the bible is merely a collection of borrowed ideas there was a good deal of trade between the eastern lands and the middle east at the time of christ and perhaps some more but leave the crap in it out woman was created after man to be his helper etc aras just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes time we don t rush it in one day christianity is your whole life it is not going to church once a week or helping poor people once in a while we box everything into time units such as work at this time sports tv social life god is above these boxes and should be when ever i turn on my tv there is this pat robertson and other brain washers oh boy what an act they put on with an number to turn in your pledges god it seems is alive and well inside these boxes carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for ourselves parting question would you have become a christian if you had not been indoctrinated by your parents you probably never learned about any other religion to make a comparative study and therefore i claim you are brain washed
c s lewis is ok was ancient books in article apr athos rutgers edu mayne ds scri fsu edu bill mayne wrote the last sentence is ironic since so many readers of soc religion christian seem to not be embarrassed by apologists such as josh mcdowell and c s lewis the above also expresses a rather odd sense of history what makes you think the masses in aquinas day who were mostly illiterate knew any more about rhetoric and logic than most people today if writings from the period seem elevated consider that only the cream of the crop so to speak could read and write if everyone in the medieval period knew the rules it was a matter of uncritically accepting what they were told bill mayne this may be unfair to lewis the most prominent fallacy attributed to him is the liar lunatic and lord as quoted by many christians this is a logical fallacy in its original context it was not clh exactly c s lewis has taken a couple of pretty severe hits in this group lately first somebody was accusing him of being self righteous and unconvincing now we are told that we christians should be embarrassed by him as well as by josh mcdowell about whom i have no comment having never read his work anyone who thinks that c s lewis was self righteous ought to read his introduction to the problem of pain which is his theodicy in it he explains that he wanted to publish the book anonymously why although he believed in the argument he was presenting he did not want to seem to presume to tell others how brave they should be in the face of their own suffering he did not want people to think that he was presenting himself as some kind of model of fortitude or that he was anything other than what he considered himself to be a great coward ofm has adequately handled the question of whether we ought to be embarrassed by lewis liar lunatic lord argument which by the way is part of a much bigger discourse i would just like to add that far from being embarrassed by lewis i am in a state of continual amazement at the soundness and clarity of the arguments he presents phil hey we re talking about the phone company here the phone company doesn t have opinions on this kind of stuff this is all me
doctrine of god this is being posted as a general outline for your personal study of this doctrine the doctrine of god i the persons of the godhead of all of the doctrines of scripture this is the most important the bible is pre eminently a revelation of god therefore our first objective in studying the bible should be to know god i believe that the bible teaches that there are three persons in the godhead trinity god the father god the son the lord jesus christ and god the holy spirit i believe that they are individual persons who are one in nature meaning that they are identical in nature each possessing the same divine attributes they are also equally worthy of our worship our trust and our obedience cf matt cor john ii the attributes or characteristics of the godhead a god s nature is revealed in the name he has taken for himself jehovah he is the living god eternal and unchanging he is without beginning and without ending cf isa b god is a spirit cf john c god is love cf john as such he is gracious merciful good faithful patient and full of lovingkindness cf psa psa nahum d but god is also holy and righteous he is absolutely without sin in his nature and so is incapable of sinning in though word or action cf ex isa e god is omnipresent everywhere present at the same time in the completeness of his person omniscient all knowing knowing all things the end from the beginning infinitely wise omnipotent almighty sovereign with unlimited power over all creation god is infinite in his presence wisdom and power it is my conviction that the work of the lord in our day has become very man centered and that the people in our churches know very little about god i believe that the lord s work needs to be god centered and that the people of god need to understand that god is sovereign in all things in the affairs of nations in the lives of all people and in the carrying out of his purposes regarding salvation iii the works of the godhead a in creation all three persons of the godhead were active in creating and all three are active in sustaining creation and in ordering the course of human affairs for nations as well as individual people to the end of time cf gen john col heb b in salvation in order to understand salvation i believe that it is absolutely necessary to begin with god not with man all three persons of the godhead have been and are active in salvation god the father salvation originated with god the members of the godhead determined in eternity past that there would be salvation the conditions under which people could and would be saved and even who would be saved election to salvation is recognized in scripture as the work of god the father cf eph thess christ the son of god the lord jesus christ through his birth by the virgin mary came to the earth to accomplish two important works a he came as the final and complete revelation of god the father cf col heb b he came to provide salvation for all whom the father had chosen he did this by his death on the cross by his bodily resurrection and by his present intercessory work in heaven the work of salvation will be completed for us when the lord returns cf rom cor heb john the holy spirit as the author of scripture the theme of which is christ and his redemptive work the holy spirit is carrying out the redemptive plan of god in the following ways a he convicts of sin cf john b he regenerates known in the bible as the new birth cf john c he indwells each believer to fulfill the work of sanctification cf john d he seals every believer in christ thus making salvation secure cf eph e he baptizes every believer into the body of christ cf cor f he teaches every believer the truth of scripture cf john g he bestows spiritual gifts on the people of god for ministry cf cor h he restrains sin cf gal i he empowers for living and for service cf acts liane brown internet brownli ohsu edu portland oregon
re questions who exactly is the lord god or jesus christ john says nkjv the little green gideon someone forced on me one day in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the word refers to jesus christ so from this john declares that god and jesus are one therefore the lord refers to both also david in the psalms refers to both god in heaven and the coming messiah as his lord once again this refers to god and jesus what is the definition of a truly religious person should he she not swear curse does it say anything about this in the bible some of the most truly religious people i ve known have not been christians and some of the greatest christians i ve known have been truly irreligious however to answer your question the bible speaks of this in many places a previous post to james is a good one another is psalm lord who may abide in your tabernacle who may dwell in your holy hill he who walks uprightly and works righteousness and speaks the truth in his heart he who does not backbite with his tongue nor does evil to his neighbor nor does he take up a reproach against his friend i whose eyes a vile person is despised but he honors those who fear the lord he who swears to his own hurt and does not change he who does not put out money at usury nor does he take a bribe aginst the innocent he who does these things shall never be moved rob coffey indeed the safest road to coffey cptc neep wisc edu hell is the gradual one the if you send mail to cptc gentle slope soft underfoot i ll never read it without sudden turnings without milestones without signposts screwtape the day techwood meets the wrecking ball the world shall rejoice but i ll have lost a former home
being right about messiahs i must have missed the postings about waco david koresh and the second coming how does one tell if a second coming is the real thing unless the person claiming to be it is obviously insane i m not saying that david koresh is the second coming of christ how could somebody who breaks his word be the second coming koresh did promise that he would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radio broadcast he didn t still it seems to me that he did fool some people and from my meagre knowledge of the bible it seems that christians have been hard on the jews of christ s day for being cautious about accepting somebody that their religious authorities didn t accept as the messiah so i was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to be early to recognize the second coming while at the same time not wanting to be credulously believing just anybody who claims to be god mark and then if any one says to you look here is the christ or look there he is do not believe it mark false christs and false prophets will arise and show signs and wonders to lead astray if possible the elect mark but take heed i have told you all things beforehand mark but in those days after that tribulation the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light mark and the stars will be falling from heaven and the powers in the heavens will be shaken mark and then they will see the son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory my understanding of jesus answer is that unlike his first coming which was veiled the second coming will be quite unmistakeable he s telling us not to be misled by the other things that have to happen before his second coming the actual second coming will make his power openly visible by the way from koresh s public statement it s not so clear to me that he is claiming to be christ clh
an agnostic s question pardon me if this is the wrong newsgroup i would describe myself as an agnostic in so far as i m sure there is no single universal supreme being but if there is one and it is just we will surely be judged on whether we lived good lives striving to achieve that goodness that is within the power of each of us now the complication is that one of my best friends has become very fundamentalist that would normally be a non issue with me but he feels it is his responsibility to proselytize me which i guess it is according to his faith this is a great strain to our friendship i would have no problem if the subject didn t come up but when it does the discussion quickly begins to offend both of us he is offended because i call into question his bedrock beliefs i am offended by what i feel is a subscription to superstition rationalized by such circular arguments as the bible is god s word because he tells us in the bible that it is so so my question is how can i convince him that this is a subject better left undiscussed so we can preserve what is in all areas other than religious beliefs a great friendship how do i convince him that i am beyond saving so he won t try thanks for any advice jim tomlinson falling snow bogart project jdt voodoo ca boeing com excellent snow boeing computer services uunet bcstec voodoo jdt anderson gabriel

re certainty and arrogance in an earlier article i explained that what many people find arrogant about christians is that some christians profess absolute certianty about their beliefs and doctrines that is many christians insist that they cannot have made any mistakes when discovering their beliefs which amounts to saying that they are infallible impicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant most of us will probably agree in short the problem is that no matter how good your sources are if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning then those doctrines are suspect so long as your own brain is involved there is a possibility for error i summarised the problem by writing there is no way out of the loop someone called rexlex has claimed that there is a way out of the loop but he did not bother to explain what it was preferring instead to paraphrase sartre ramble about wittgenstein and say that the conclusion of my argument leads to relativism as i have explained to him before you cannot reject an argument as false because you dislike where it leads the facts do not change just because you dislike them rexlex wrote i disagree with dr nancy s sweetie s conclusion because if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair however as any first year philosophy student can explain what rexlex has written does not constitute a refutation all he has said is that he does not like what i wrote he has done nothing at all to dispute it there were two sentences in rexlex s post that seemed relevant to the point at hand there is such a thing as true truth and it is real it can be experienced and it is verifiable i do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience i have for example direct experience of adding numbers i don t claim to be infallible at it in fact i remember doing sums incorrectly but i do claim that i have direct experience of reasoning about numbers however once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about them we are on much shakier ground that was the point of the earlier article human brains are infested with sin and they can only be trusted in very limited circumstances it is only because of god s own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing but how far does that get you once god s revelation stops and your own reasoning begins possibility for error appears for example let s suppose that our modern bible translations include a perfect rendering of jesus words at the last supper and that jesus said exactly this is my body we ll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely true what can we be certain of not much at the moment he stops speaking and people start interpreting the possibility of error appears did he mean that literally or not we do not have any record that he elaborated on the words was he thinking of tran or con substatiation he didn t say we interpret this passage using our brains we think and reason and draw conclusions but we know that our brains are not perfect our thinking often leads us wrong this is something that most of us have direct experience of why should anyone believe that his reasoning which he knows to be fallible can lead him to perfect conclusions so given the assumptions in this example what we can be certain of is that jesus said this is my body beyond that once we start making up doctrines and using our brains to reason about what christ revealed we get into trouble unless you are infallible there are very few things you can be certain of to the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking they cannot be certain that is the problem of seeming arrogant the non christians around us know that human beings make mistakes just as surely as we know it they do not believe we are infallible any more than we do when christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead them astray when we implicitly claim that we are infallible the non christians around us rarely believe that implicit claim witnessing is hardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you are either too foolish to recognise your own limits or intentionally trying to cover them up i think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what things we are only very confident of for example we might say that we know our sin for recognising sin is something we directly experience but other things whether based on reasoning from scripture or extra biblical thinking should not be labled as infallible we should say that we are very confident of them and be ready to explain our reasoning but so far as i am aware none of us is infallible speaking or acting as if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous rexlex suggested that people read he is there and he is not silent by francis schaeffer i didn t think very highly of it but i think that mr schaeffer is grossly overrated by many evangelical christians somebody else might like it though so don t let my opinion stop you from reading it if someone is interested in my opinion i d suggest on certainty by ludwig wittgenstein darren f provine kilroy gboro rowan edu if any substantial number of talk religion misc readers read some wittgenstein of the postings would disappear if they understood some wittgenstein would disappear

re sabbath admissions of all of the arguments concerning the sabbath ought to make the point pretty clear anyone outside of the catholic or orthodox oranglican or monophysite churches ourght to worship on saturday if they are really sola scriptura otherwise they are following a law put into effect by the church and only the above chruches really recognize any power of the chruch to do so andy byler you will note that nothing in the faq said anything about the church establishing or changing a law the argument against the sabbath is that it is part of the ceremonial law and like the rest of the ceremonial law is not binding on christians this argument is based on paul s letters acts and in a more general sense jesus teachings further most people argue that scripture shows worship occuring on sunday and paul endorsing it i understand that these points are disputed and do not want to go around the dispute one more time the point i m making here is not that these arguments are right but that the backing they claim is scripture accepting the principle of sola scriptura does not commit us to obeying the entire jewish law acts and paul s letters are quite clear on that i think even the sda s accept it the disagreement is on where the bible would have us place the line by the way protestants do give authority to the church in matters that are not dictated by god that s why churches are free to determine their own liturgies church polity etc if you accept that the sabbath is not binding on christians then the day of worship falls into the category of items on which individual christians or since worship is by its nature a group activity churches are free to decide clh

quality of catholic liturgy i appreciated the follow ups and replies to my earlier query one reply which i have lost suggested several parishes in new york that have good masses one of which was corpus christi in downtown manhattan by coincidence last week s america the national jesuit magazine carried an interview with fr myles bourke corpus christi s pastor emeritus fr bourke also directed the nt translation in the new american bible he noted certain practices have been introduced into the mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality and sometimes of hilarity has trivialized the liturgy i note that at my parents parish on easter helium filled balloons were distributed at the offertory apparently to aid in understanding the word risen this was not a kiddie mass either but the well attended mass i wanted to note the generous spirit behind the replies this newsgroup as a whole offers generally moderate perhaps because it s moderated conversation on topics that often lead people to extreme behavior including myself sometimes people do go over the top but the remarkable thing is how that is the exception i think benefits of the doubt are generally granted it seems so christian john murray
re did he really rise in article apr geneva rutgers edu parkin eng sun com writes desperately wanted the jewish people to accept him as the messiah if the crucification was the will of god how could jesus pray that this cup pass from him was this out of weakness never many men and women have given their lives for their country or other noble causes is jesus less than these no he is not he knew the crucification was not the will of god god s will was that the jewish people accept jesus as the messiah and that the kingdom of heaven be established on the earth with jesus as it s head just like the jewish people expected if this had happened years ago can you imagine what why do you assume that jesus s plea to his father to let this cup pass from him was merely a plea to escape death when i look at jesus in the garden i see a man god who all his life had had the presense of his father with him as a result he knew every detail about his death long before the agony in the garden but as that hour approached he felt abandoned by his father his presense diminishing with each passing minute in addition it was brought more and more to jesus s attention the betrayal of judas was probably a big impact that his suffering would be to no avail for many people especially those who would reject him not only then but in the future i truly believe that the majority of jesus s suffering was mental and spiritual while the physical portion was only the tip of the iceburg btw we know from john s account that jesus shunned becomming an earthly king from john joh after the people saw the miraculous sign that jesus did they began to say surely this is the prophet who is to come into the world joh jesus knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force withdrew again to a mountain by himself this does not seem like a man who would regret not becoming an earthly king no jesus knew his mission was to redeem all jew gentile people and establish his kingdom in the hearts of those who would believe this was utterly mistaken much to jesus s dismay as an aspiration to some earthly kingdom but he knew what his father s will was and followed it obediently even in the darkness of his passion john g ata technical consultant internet ata hfsi com hfs inc va uucp uunet hfsi ata westpark drive ms voice mclean va fax

harrassed at work could use some prayers my news feed is broken and i haven t received any new news in hours more than days so if you reply to this please send private email to the address esther demand ed ray com i have set the reply to line to have that address but i don t know if it will work it depends upon the software but generally i wouldn t expect reply to to cause an email cc to be sent in addition to a posting you ll probably need to do something specific which will vary depending upon your news software clh at any rate i need some support much thanks to jayne k who is already supporting me with kind words and prayers i ve been working at this company for eight years in various engineering jobs i m female yesterday i counted and realized that on seven different occasions i ve been sexually harrassed at this company seven times eight years yesterday was the most recent one someone left an x rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer i m really upset by this i suppose it could have been worse it could have been a man having sex with a sheep or something there was no note i do not know if it was someone s idea of an innocent joke that went awry someone s sick idea of flirting an act of emotional terrorism that worked i dreaded coming back to work today what if my boss comes in to ask me some kind of question i don t know the answer so i take a military specification down off from my shelf to look up the answer and out falls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep i generally have a bible on my desk for occasional inspiration what if i open it up to corinthians and find a picture a la the north american man boy love association i want to throw up just thinking about this stuff i can lock up my desk but i can t lock up every book i have in the office i can t trust that someone won t shove something into my briefcase or my coat pocket when i m not looking so that i go home to find such a picture or a threat or a raunchy note about what someone wants to do to my body to make it worse the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to treat our marvelous secretary to lunch the appointed hour for leaving was i was working in another building but wanted to go to the lunch so i returned at only to find that ever single person had already left for lunch they left at or so no one could be bothered to call me at the other building even though my number was posted so i came back to a department that looked like a neutron bomb had gone off and i was the sole survivor this despite the fact that everyone knew how bad i felt about this naked woman being left in my desk drawer i need some prayers i can t stop crying i am so deeply wounded that it s ridiculous i feel like i m some kind of sub human piece of garbage for people to reduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act i feel like i m a sub human piece of garbage that s not worthy of a simple phone call saying we re leaving for mary s lunch a little early so that bob can get back for a big meeting please pray that my resentments will either go away or be miraculously turned into something positive please pray that whoever is torturing me so will stop and find some healing for him or herself please pray for my being healed from this latest wound which falls on top of a whole slew of other wounds please pray that i can find a new job in a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such harrassment from happening in the first place and swiftly acts appropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions this company in my opinion has pretty words about how sexual harrassment isn t tolerated but when you get right down to it how is it that one female engineer can be touched inappropriately left obsene or threatening notes left obscene pictures spoken to lewdly etc seven times in eight years in the same place pretty words from the company do me no good when i m terrified or healing from the latest assault and please pray that i don t turn into an automaton because of this that s my bad habit ignore it and it will go away you re not worth anyone s time so don t go talking to anyone about this you re right you are a sub human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this way you are just an object you prostitute your mind to this company so why can t others expect you to prostitute your body there as well what makes you think women aren t just possessions and nothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act this is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major depressive episode please pray that these thoughts don t come into my head and stay there triggering depression please pray that this latest trauma doesn t come between me and god in a way a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to god and it s also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can separate one mentally from god i know god doesn t drop me from his loving hand but it s awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the hand look down think i m falling and forget that god s still holding on to me although this probably isn t entirely appropriate for this newsgroup i really can use the kind of loving support you all provide for this reason i hope good mr moderator allows me this latest indulgence after all he s allowed me the thermometer note and

re sspx schism in article apr geneva rutgers edu shellgate llo uu psi com larry l overacker writes you ask where we are i would echo that question i m not trying to be contentious but assuming that the pope has universal jurisdiction and authority what authority do you rely upon for your decisions what prevents me from choosing any doctrine i like and saying that papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time this is especially true since councils of bishops have basically stood by the pope the ultimate question is the traditional theology of the church this is the only thing that it is possible to resist a pope for his departure from the traditional doctrine of the church if commands from any authority conflict with tradition the commands must be disobeyed my own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major way god would never allow a hair splitting situation to develop it would be too complex for people to figure out i don t view the present situation in the church as anything extremely complicated run through a list of what has happened in the last years in the catholic church and any impartial observer will be aghast it appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is disagreements over what is tradition and tradition and also over authority and discipline the problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the catholic faith in my opinion most catholics know about zilch about the catholic faith this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring bishops it s basically the reformation part ii there is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the shards of the catholic church are currently being trampled upon by the catholic hierarchy i could go on listing shocking things for an hour probably take the situation in campos brazil for example i m reading a book on what happened there after vatican council ii the bishop antonio de castro mayer never introduced all the changes that followed in the wake of vatican ii he kept the traditional mass the same old catechisms etc he made sure the people knew their faith the catholic theology of obedience what modernism was etc he innoculated the people against what was coming well one day the order came from rome for his retirement it came when the pope was sick bishop de castro mayer waited until the pope recovered then inquired whether this command was what the pope really wanted or something that some liberal had commanded in his absence the pope confirmed the decision so the good bishop retired the injustice that followed was completely incredible a new bishop was installed he proceeded to expel most of bishop de castro mayer s clergy from their churches because they refused to celebrate the new mass the new bishop would visit a parish and celebrate a new mass the people would promptly walk out of the church en masse the bishop was enraged by this he usually resorted to enlisting the help of the secular authorities to eject the priest from the church the priests would just start building new churches the people were completely behind them the old parishes had the new mass as the bishop desired and virtually no parishioners the prime motivation for all this was completely illegal according to canon law no priest can be penalized in any way for saying the traditional mass because of legislation enacted by pope saint pius v nor is there any obligation to say the new mass during all this process the people of campos not just private individuals but including civil authorities were constantly sending petitions and letters to rome to do something about the new modernist bishop nothing was ever done no help ever arrived from rome eventually priests were kicked out and about people my question to the supporters of sspx is this is there any way that your positions with respect to church reforms could change and be conformed to those of the pope assuming that the pope s position does not change and that the leaders of sspx don t jointly make such choice if not this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority if i adopt the view that i m not wrong i can t be wrong and there s no way i ll change my mind you must change yours that i ve either left the catholic church or it has left me if the pope defines certain things ex cathedra that would be the end of the controversy that process is all very well understood in catholic theology and anyone who doesn t go along with it is an instant non catholic the problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in the catholic world if they knew the faith and what our bishops are doing they would be shocked we sould argue from now until the second coming about what the real traditional teaching of the church is if this were a simple matter east and west would not have been separated for over years this isn t the case in the catholic church there is a massive body of traditional teaching the popes of the last years are especially relevant there is no question at all what the traditional doctrine is i thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term i may be wrong here i m not roman catholic that s heresy more or less although they have done a great job since the reformation the last years have seen so many errors spread that it s pitiful infallibility rests in the pope and in the church as a whole in the short term a pope or large sections of the church can go astray in fact that s what usually happens during a major heresy large sections of the church go astray the pope historically has been much more reliable everything will always come back in the long run what would be the effect of a pope making an ex cathedra statement regarding the sspx situation would it be honored if not how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility again i m not trying to be contentions i m trying to understand since i m orthodox i ve got no real vested interest in the outcome one way or the other yes it would be honored infallibility is infallibility but what is he going to define that the new mass is a better expression of the catholic faith than the old that sex education in the catholic schools is wonderful that all religions are wonderful except for that professed by the popes prior to vatican ii it does if the command was legitimate sspx does not view the pope s commands as legitimate why this is a very slippery slope not really start studying the major catholic theologians of the last years everything is very well spelled out the west excels at critical thought remember that s what catholic theologians have been busy at for centuries
re when are two people married in god s eyes in article apr geneva rutgers edu mcovingt aisun ai uga edu michael covington writes in article apr athos rutgers edu randerso acad sahs uth tmc edu robert anderson writes i would like to get your opinions on this when exactly does an engaged couple become married in god s eyes not if they are unwilling to go through a public marriage ceremony nor if they say they are willing but have not actually done so let s distinguish real logistical problems like being stranded on a desert island from excuses such as waiting for so and so s brother to come back from being in the army so he can be in the ceremony i disagree people marry each other when they commit fully to each other as life partners they are married the ceremony may assist in emphasizing the depth of such a commitment but is of itself nothing god knows our hearts he knows when two have committed themselves to be one he knows the fears and delusions we have that keep us from fully giving ourselves to another the way i see it you d have to be living together in a marriage for somewhere between and years before anyone knew if a marriage really existed but god knows i don t think god keeps a scorebook joe moore
re certainty and arrogance darren dr nancy s sweetie kilroy gboro rowan edu writes darren in an earlier article i explained that what many people find darren arrogant about christians is that some christians profess darren absolute certainty about their beliefs and doctrines and darren in short the problem is that no matter how good your sources darren are if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own darren thinking and reasoning then those doctrines are suspect the point that darren raises is a very lutheran viewpoint while reason is a gift from god it is also infected by sin yet we do not reject reason entirely and neither i think does darren we need reason as darren himself has pointed out to comprehend god s revelation of himself in the bible but reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe the word we need first and foremost faith for the sinful mind is hostile to god it does not submit to god s law nor can it do so romans luther accepted scripture as the sole means of revelation sola scriptura but accepted the necessity of the use of reason with faith in comprehending that revelation yet luther also said regarding baptism but mad reason rushes forth and because baptism is not dazzling like the works which we do regards it as worthless large catechism fourth part baptism to make matters more complicated luther was the sort of theologian that many people would describe as an absolutist i ve seen him described as a take no prisoners theologian we might conclude given these observations that luther was inconsistent or mad and surely at least some have come to that conclusion but it might be useful to recall that jesus was also called mad and peter felt compelled to defend himself and the apostles against a charge of drunkenness on pentecost so we as christians ought to be careful about rejecting luther or others as mad rather we should imitate the bereans who examined the scriptures every day to see if what paul said was true acts the basis for the confidence with which luther peter paul and many others preached the gospel was not just reason but faith and the holy spirit this is not faith divorced from reason but a faith that guides informs and uses reason the spirit enables us to know the truth and to proclaim it boldly god does not want us to preach the message that i think that jesus might have risen from the dead but rather i know that my redeemer lives job the christian does not side with pilate in saying what is truth but rather follows christ who said in fact for this reason i was born and for this i came into the world to testify to the truth everyone on the side of truth listens to me john we can know the truth because god has promised us that we can know the truth jesus said if you hold to my teachings you are really my disciples then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free john the proverbs urge us buy the truth and do not sell it pr the psalmist prayed do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth ps evidently he believed that the word of truth was in fact in his mouth yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth is motivated by self glorification but if we present the truth as the teachings of scripture revealed by the spirit and not our own invention and if we stand ready to be proved wrong on the basis of scripture as luther did then we are not arrogant but humble we should humbly trust in god s promise of truth just as we trust in his promise of forgiveness rexlex it is only because of god s own revelation that we can be rexlex absolute about a thing darren but how far does that get you once god s revelation stops darren and your own reasoning begins possibility for error appears i agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings of scripture and the products of our own reason even when such reasoning is based on scripture however i think i would draw the line of distinction more reasonably and less academically than you would darren for example let s suppose that our modern bible translations darren include a perfect rendering of jesus words at the last supper darren and that jesus said exactly this is my body darren we ll presume that what he said was totally without error and darren absolutely true what can we be certain of not much darren at the moment he stops speaking and people start darren interpreting the possibility of error appears did he mean darren that literally or not we do not have any record that he darren elaborated on the words was he thinking of tran or con darren substantiation he didn t say darren is almost at the point of making a very lutheran statement about the lord s supper the lutheran approach is to say that if jesus said this is my body then that is what we should believe other interpretations are rejected simply because they are not taught in scripture recall that jesus words do not stand alone on this subject we also have paul s words in corinthians in which he passed on to us what he received from the lord in particular he said for whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup you proclaim the lord s death until he comes by these words we should believe that the bread that we eat in the lord s supper really is bread as well as the lord s body as our senses in fact tell us does this prove that tran substantiation is false i suppose someone could say that paul spoke metaphorically of the lord s body as bread simply because that is the way the body appears when we eat it but this thought is found nowhere in scripture so we reject it thus the primary reason for rejecting tran substantiation is not that we can prove it false but that it is simply not found in scripture side remark i ve been told that the lutheran doctrine on real presence is con substantiation but it has been non lutherans who have told me this we tend not to use the word i almost think that this is used more by professors of comparative religion who need labels to compare catholic lutheran and reformed teachings on the lord s supper but almost every church wants to call their own teaching real presence because that was the traditional teaching of the church end side remark darren when christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning darren can never lead them astray when we implicitly claim that we darren are infallible the non christians around us rarely believe darren that implicit claim witnessing is hardly going to work when darren the person you are talking to believes that you are either too darren foolish to recognise your own limits or intentionally trying darren to cover them up this is precisely why christians should not rely on rationalizations in their witnessing it is far better to take the approach i d like to show you what scripture says you decide for yourself whether to believe it or not darren rexlex suggested that people read he is there and he is not darren silent by francis schaeffer i didn t think very highly of darren it but i think that mr schaeffer is grossly overrated by many darren evangelical christians somebody else might like it though darren so don t let my opinion stop you from reading it darren if someone is interested in my opinion i d suggest on darren certainty by ludwig wittgenstein as long as we re trading references i d like to suggest dr siegbert becker s paperback the foolishness of god the place of reason in lutheran theology published by northwestern publishing house this book was based on becker s doctoral thesis at the university of chicago david wagner not by might nor by power a confessional lutheran but by my spirit says the lord almighty zechariah
re question jesus alone oneness in article apr geneva rutgers edu bjorn b larsen delab sintef no a writes can anybody tell me the basic reasons for holding a belief that there is only jesus and vice versa the foundations for the trinity bjorn i d love to know how jesus only proponents would answer questions like who is this father jesus keeps referring to why does he call himself the son why does he pray to the father and not to himself why does he emphasize that he does his father s will and not his own if he was doing his own will what kind of example is that should we follow it when he says he has to return to the father who is he going to when he says he does this in order that the comforter the holy spirit might come who might that be if he claims that the coming of the holy spirit is such a blessing that it s worth his leaving us and returning to the father what can that mean if there is no holy spirit why doesn t the best known christian prayer begin our saviour who art in heaven rather than our father do they have answers to these questions that are even plausible further entertaining queries are left as an exercise to the reader drt david r tucker kg s drt athena mit edu there may be some misunderstanding over terms here i believe jesus only originally was in the context of baptism these are folks who believe that baptism should be done with a formula mentioning only jesus rather than father son and holy spirit this may have doctrinal implications but as far as i know it does not mean that these folks deny the existence or divinity of the father i m not the right one to describe this theology and in fact i think there may be several including what would classically be called monophysite or arian two rather different views as well as some who have beliefs that are probably consistent with trinitarian standards but who won t use trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply because it is not biblical clh

re revelations babylon in article apr geneva rutgers edu jbuddenberg vax cns muskingum edu jimmy buddenberg writes hello all we are doing a bible study at my college on revelations we have been doing pretty good as far as getting some sort of reasonable interpretation we are now on chapters and which talk about the woman on the beast and the fall of babylon i believe the beast is the antichrist some may differ but it seems obvious and the woman represents babylon which stands for rome or the roman catholic church what are some views on this interpretation is the falling babylon in chapter the same babylon in as in chapter the catholic church hate to step on toes thanks an interesting interpretation of revelation and has been given by evangelist david wilkerson i am not saying that i totally agree with his interpretation but it is certainly believable and good food for thought he interprets the babylon of revelation as being none other than the good old u s of a that s right america he supports his claim in several ways the babylon of revelation is the world leader in trade and commerce and the whole world wept when babylon fell the american dollar despite the japanese success of the th century is still the most sought after currency in the world if the u s were destroyed wouldn t the whole world mourn the bible also talks about babylon being a home of harlots sin and adultery i am paraphrasing of course babylon s sin affected or should i say infected the whole world it doesn t take much looking to see that the u s is in a state of moral decay hasn t the american culture and hollywood spread the do it if it feels good mentality all over the world i think though that what mr wilkerson uses as his strongest argument is the fact that revelation calls babylon babylon the great and portrays it as the most powerful nation on earth no matter how dissatisfied you are with the state of our country i don t think you would have too much trouble agreeing that the u s is still the most powerful nation on earth again this interpretation is not necessarily my own but i do find it worthy of consideration jeffrey little
afterlife here is another way of looking at it when we die we are released from the arc of time and able to comprehend our lives in toto to visit each moment in time sequentially or all at once but not able to alter the actions thoughts or feelings we had have will have in this life from that perspective i posit that all will have direct knowledge of god and be able to recognize at each moment of time wether we were doing what we ought that the experience of having lived a life far from god will be an eternal torment that having lived a life of grace will be an eternal joy that the resurrection of the body comes not from any physical reconstitution of our present forms but knowledge of our present forms by our fully cognizant souls as an aside if we were to be restricted for all time to our present form would you opt for immortality james sledd think in n dimensions listen for the voice of god

saint story st aloysius gonzaga heres a story of a saint that people might like to read i got it from a the morning star and am posting it with the permission of the editor saint aloysius gonzaga the patron of youth the marquis gonzaga had high aspirations for his son the prince gonzage he wanted him to become a famous brave and honoured soldier after all he must carry on the great family name of gonzaga of course he was to become far more famous brave and honoured than his father could ever have imagined though not in the manner expected saint aloysius mother was a woman who received immense joy from praying to god and meditating on the divine mysteries and the life of our lord she had little time for the pleasures of this life as saint aloysius grew he began to resemble his mother more than his father saint aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his father s soldiers but the moment he discovered that they were vulgar he fainted from shock this shows his immense hatred of sin what an example for us of the contempt we must have for sin about the time of his first holy communion which he received from the archbishop of milan charles borromeo whom himself became a great saint he con secrated his purity to god and asked the blessed virgin to protect his innocence for life he wanted to share our lord s suffering to show his reciprocal love he started by denying his passions he avoided eating the finest foods wearing the best clothes and would put pieces of wood in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of god while he was in his early teens his father sent him and his younger brother to the court of the spanish king phillip obediently he set out to make the best of it he mixed in well with the people of the royal court for he was handsome polite intelligent and always had something interesting to say not long before this time the great soldier saint saint igna tius of loyola had founded the society of jesus the jesuits towards which saint aloysius began to have a yearning when he finally told his father the marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest after a short time his father sent him to the great cities in order that he be tempted away from the priesthood but even through these trials saint aloysius grew in his desire for the religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity the marquis plans were obviously failing so he con fronted his son will you or will you not obey me and forget this foolish ness i will not father was the in evitable reply then leave from my sight and don t return until you change your mind with tears clouding his eyes the saint left the room to pray tell me lord what am i to do tell me tell me he knelt down to flagellate himself as he had done several times before but this time he was seen the onlooker rushed to the marquis this at last brought the proud man to his senses the lord wants him the lord can have him he gave his consent for his son to become a jesuit after some years at the end of the sixteenth century a terri ble epidemic broke out in rome all the hospitals were full and could house no more so the jesuits opened their own saint aloy sius did all he could in the hospitals particularly to prepare the dying for a holy death saint aloysius himself contracted the plague from carrying and nursing the sick for three months he lay with a burning fever and finally on june st he gave his soul to the lord while gazing at a crucifix let us invoke saint aloysius as our patron and imitate him in his humility purity and confidence in prayer saint aloysius gonzaga pray for us brendan arthur prayer is as necessary to a person consecrated to the service of others as a sword is to a soldier god bless from simon lines simon p shields programmer viva cristo rey monash university college gippsland ph jhs switchback rd churchill fax

re latest on branch davidians in apr geneva rutgers edu aaron binah cc brandeis edu scott aaron writes in article apr geneva rutgers edu conditt tsd arlut utexas edu paul conditt wrote i think it s really sad that so many people put their faith in a mere man even if he did claim to be the son of god and or a prophet i ll pose a question here that s got me thinking what distinguishes true religion from cults i m speaking generally here not specifially about christianity jerry falwell was on good morning america on tuesday ostensibly to answer this question basically he said that true religion follows a message whereas a cult follows a person but then christianity is a cult because the message of christianity is the person of jesus so what distinguishes for example the branch davidian cult from the presbyterian church doctrinal differences don t answer the question imho so don t use them as an answer as far as i can see one of the big differences between davidians and christians is in who they follow i have sometimes tried to put myself in the feet of one of jesus s disciples basically they gave up a lot career possibly family and well a whole bunch to follow jesus so what is the difference it is quite plain jesus was good and david koresh was not the problem is i think is that we try to legislate what is good and what is bad in terms of principles for instance there are thousands of laws in the u s governing what is legal and what is not often it is hard to bring people to justice because it is not possible to find a legal way to do it if only we could trust judges to be just then we could tell them to administer justice fairly and justice would be followed but since judges don t always get it right we have a complicated system involving precedent and bunches of other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect the justice of man into something perfect but what i hear about the justice system in the u s tells me that quite the opposite is true there is also a problem that we tend to judge the presentation more than the material being presented so we might consider a ranting christian to be bad but an eloquent person from another religion to be good this goes along with the american desire to protect the constitution at all costs even if it allows people to do bad things i think that it is the message that is important if a man is presenting a false message even if he is ever ever so mild mannered then that man is performing a tremendous disservice i know that i am rambling here i guess that what i am trying to say is that we shouldn t be looking for principles that tell us why the davidians got it wrong it is not wrong to follow and worship a person but it is important to choose the right person it is simple choose jesus and you got it right choose anyone else and you got it wrong why because jesus is the begotten son of god and nobody else is jesus was without sin and nobody else was stephen

re the arrogance of christians if i don t think my belief is right and everyone else s belief is wrong then i don t have a belief this is simply what belief means unfortunatly this seems to be how christians are taught to think when it comes to their religion some take it to the extreme and say that their religion is the only one and if you don t accept their teachings then you won t be saved it takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim to know what god thinks wants especially when it s based upon your interpretation of a book the logic in the above statement is faulty in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs can t both be correct it s all about perception no two people are exactly alike no two people perceive everything in the same way i believe that there is one truth call it god s truth a universal truth or call it what you will i don t believe god presents this truth i think it is just there and it s up to you to look for and see it through prayer meditation inspir ation dreams or whatever just because people may perceive this truth differently it doesn t mean one is wrong and the other is right as an example take the question is the glass half empty or half full you can have two different answers which are contradictory and yet both are correct so for your belief to be true does not require everyone else s belief to be wrong if a person has what they believe is convincing evidence that god will save only christians it s hard to see how you can criticize them for arrogance for saying so it could be that they re wrong but i hardly see that it s arrogance let s look at this a bit closer suppose we had some combination of prophets and messiahs that taught us things but didn t say anything about exclusivity if we believe them and then add and anybody who believes anything else is damned then you could well criticize us for arrogance but in this case the exclusivity is in the message as it comes from the prophets etc so we could be wrong in believing it but i don t see how we can be called arrogant maybe the world isn t a soft place maybe certain choices actually do have eternal consequences i can see calling the christian message arrogant in a certain sense though only in the same sense as calling the law of gravitation arrogant because it doesn t give us any option over whether we fall if we jump off a building but not christians for passing it on given that they believe it the complaints i can see making are that christians are wrong or that god is arrogant clh

re sspx schism bob van cleef writes if the papacy is infallible and this is a matter of faith then the pope cannot be wrong if on the other hand this is not a matter of faith but a matter of church law then we should still obey as the pope is the legal head of the church in other words given the doctrine of infallibility we have no choice but to obey this is a primary problem in the church today what you are saying is more or less heresy you might call it infallibilism it s the idea that the pope is always right in everything he says or does this is virtually all over the place especially in this country the pope is only infallible under certain very specific and well defined conditions when these conditions are not met he can make mistakes he can make big mistakes a couple historical examples come to mind bishop robert grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of the english catholic church at one point during his career the reigning pope decided to install one of his nephews in an english see bishop grosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body though maybe not in so many words you have to treat popes with respect even when they are wrong the problem was that this nephew would just collect the income of the see and probably never set foot there this would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd bishop grosseteste was quite right in what he did another example is that of pope john xxii a pope of the middle ages he decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the beatific vision until the last judgement he decided that this should be a defined doctrine of the church though he didn t quite get around to defining it now there s no way this is compatible with catholic doctrine the pope s doctrine was criticised by many in the church he went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail even in the end he had to admit his mistake shortly before he died he recanted his successor made the exact opposite idea a dogma of the church if you consult any of the great catholic theologians who treat of such subjects such as st robert bellarmine a doctor of the church you will find detailed discussions of whether the pope can personally fall into heresy or schism the teaching of all such theologians is that the commands of a pope must be resisted if they are to the detriment of the catholic faith a pope s authority is given for the purpose of building up the catholic church commands in conflict with this purpose have no legal or moral force

re tuff to be a christian someone writing anonymously asks would you have become a christian if you had not been indoctrinated by your parents you probably never learned about any other religion to make a comparative study and therefore i claim you are brain washed i did become a christian without having been indoctrinated by my parents and having studied buddhism fairly carefully and other religions to a lesser degree i made a decision to accept the truth claims of christianity after having given it a lot of thought i have to point out that the process was not purely a cold rational one there was a powerful experiential element as well also my calvinist should rest assured that i don t lay any of the responsibility for the outcome my conversion on anyone but god it took me years and years for this all to happen because i had many of the objections that this poster puts forward i grew up in the shadow of generic authoritarian conservative denomination and i knew that that wasn t a way of life that i could adopt but i gradually learned not to tar all of christianity with the same brush and realized quite suddenly one cold winter night that i accepted what i had heretofore rejected i am quite certain that i was not brain washed bill hovingh

re when are two people married in god s eyes in article apr geneva rutgers edu rob ll mit edu writes i think it was lewis who said that in a wedding it s the principals that marry each other the church and the state are present merely as witnesses this is not just lewis it s a summary of standard catholic theology however this doesn t mean that the presence of those witnesses is optional except in odd situations like the standard desert island clh i originally wrote to the person who asked this question personally but decided to post the information i had on the topic i spoke to the pastor of my parish catholic recently by coincidence on this subject his explaination was that while it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence of a priest it is important to have it recognized by the church as soon as it is possible because the church recoginizes itself as a community of believers members of the church to some degree are to be held accountable to each other to be less hypothetical than that mythical couple on the desert island there are many places in the world that do not have priests availible for marriages on a regular basis therefore couples get married without the priest being present but get the priest to testify to their marriage when one comes through the area i remember a religion teacher in high school saying that the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple as much as it is for the benefit of the community thus married couples have some responsibility to the community to stay married as divorce sets a bad example for the community also the couple has vowed to become one with one another the community should be able to rely on that couple to be as one while couples may marry without witnesses they may not get anulments without a priest present an anulment is simply an admission of the church that what they had declared a marriage was not in fact a marriage at all for whatever reason so don t start getting married in the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves anulments a half hour later i tend to agree with the response back there that said couples become married as soon as they consumate their marriage but i would add that couples should consider their marriage consumated if they have sex whether or not they intended to be married assuming they were both willing partners to the sexual act the couple must be prepared to raise any children they may have as a result of that sexual act with the benefit of both parents sex is a commitment i believe in god s eyes but i m digressing god be with you malcusco

why religion and which religion my family has never been particularly religious singing christmas carols is about the limit for them thus i ve never really believed in god and heaven although i don t actually believe that they don t exist either i m sort of undecided probably like a lot of people i guess lately i ve been thinking about it all a lot more and i wondered how religious people can be so convinced that there is a god i feel as though i want to believe but i m not used to believing things without proof just as i can t believe that there definitely isn t a god so i can t definitely believe that there is i wondered if most of you were brought up by religious families and never believed any different can anyone help me to understand how your belief and faith in god can be so strong another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is correct how do you choose a religion and how do you know that the christian god exists and the gods of other religions don t how do you feel about people who follow other religions how about atheists and people like me agnostics i suppose do you respect their religion and accept their beliefs as just as valid as your own isn t there contradiction between the religions how can your religion be more valid than any others do you have less respect for someone if they re not religious or if they follow a different religion than you would if they were christian also how much of the scriptures are correct are all events in the bible really supposed to have happened or are they just supposed to be stories with morals showing a true christian how to behave i generally follow most of the christian ideas which i suppose are fairly universal throughout all religions not killing stealing etc and loving my neighbour for want of a better expression the only part i find hard is the actual belief in god finally what is god s attitude to people like me who don t quite believe in him but are generally fairly good people surely not believing doesn t make me a worse person if not i find myself wondering why i so strongly want to really believe and to find a religion sorry if i waffled on a bit i was just writing ideas as they came into my head i m sure i probably repeated myself a bit too thanks for the help paul simmons there s been enough discussion about evidence for christianity recently that you may prefer to respond to this via email rather than as a posting clh
re sabbath admissions of i wrote in response to dlecoint garnet acns fsu edu darius lecointe it s not clear how much more needs to be said other than the faq i think paul s comments on esteeming one day over another rom is probably all that needs to be said was paul a god too is an interpretation of the words of paul of higher priority than the direct word of jesus in matt paul begins romans with if someone is weak in the faith do you count yourself as one who is weak in the faith i accept that darius is doing what he does in honor of the lord i just wish he might equally accept that those who esteem all days alike are similarly doing their best to honor the lord yes but what does the bible have to say what did jesus say paul closes romans with on the other hand the person with doubts about something who eats it anyway is guilty because he isn t acting on his faith and any failure to act on faith is a sin gaus isbn have you read the ten commandments which are a portion of the law have you read jesus word in matt is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is sin greek hamartia missing the mark however i d like to be clear that i do not think there s unambiguous proof that regular christian worship was on the first day as i indicated there are responses on both of the passages cited whereas the ten commandments and jesus words in matt are fairly clear are they not the difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something else they both look like they are talking about nnregular christian meetings but neither explicitly says and they gathered every sunday for worship we get various pieces of information but nothing aimed at answering this question matt doesn t answer your question what day christians met in their houses acts despite darius confusion is described by acts as occuring on sunday it doesn t say they gathered to see paul off but that when they were gathered for breaking bread breaking bread roughly synonymous with eating so i think the most obvious reading of this is that on the first day of every week simply means every time they gather for worship how do you unite this concept of yours with the ten commandments and jesus s word in matt i think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the nt authors assumed that their readers knew when christian worship was clh or they assumed that the ten commandments and jesus word in matt actually stood for something perhaps they were strong in the faith no i don t believe that paul can overrule god however paul was writing for a largely gentile audience the law was regarded by jews at the time and now as binding on jews but not on gentiles there are rules that were binding on all human beings the so called noachic laws but they are quite minimal the issue that the church had to face after jesus death was what to do about gentiles who wanted to follow christ the decision not to impose the law on them didn t say that the law was abolished it simply acknowledged that fact that it didn t apply to gentiles thus there is no contradiction with mat as far as i can tell both paul and other jewish christians did continue to participate in jewish worship on the sabbath thus they continued to obey the law the issue was and is with gentile christians who are not covered by the law or at least not by the ceremonial aspects of it jesus dealt mostly with jews i think we can reasonably assume that mat was directed to a jewish audience he did interact with gentiles a few times e g the centurion whose slave was healed and a couple of others the terms used to describe the centurion see luke suggest that he was a god fearer i e a gentile who followed god but had not adopted the whole jewish law he was commended by jewish elders as a worthy person and jesus accepted him as such this seems to me to indicate that jesus accepted the prevailing view that gentiles need not accept the law however there s more involved if you want to compare jesus and paul on the law in order to get a full picture of the role of the law we have to come to grips with paul s apparent rejection of the law and how that relates to jesus commendation of the law at least as i read paul he says that the law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded again this issue isn t one of the abolition of the law in the middle of his discussion paul notes that he might be understood this way and assures us that that s not what he intends to say rather he sees the law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness but ultimately it s an impossible standard and one that has been superceded by christ paul s comments are not the world s clearest here and not everyone agrees with my reading but the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the law it still remains as an uncompromising standard from which not an iota or dot may be removed for its purpose of convicting of sin it s important that it not be relaxed however for christians it s not the end ultimately we live in faith not law while the theoretical categories they use are rather different in the end i think jesus and paul come to a rather similar conclusion the quoted passage from mat should be taken in the context of the rest of the sermon on the mount where jesus shows us how he interprets the law the not an iota or dot would suggest a rather literal reading but in fact that s not jesus approach jesus interpretations emphasize the intent of the law and stay away from the ceremonial details indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the sabbath and kosher laws some scholars claim that mat needs to be taken in the context of st cent jewish discussions jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs but neglecting the things that really matter justice mercy and faith and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity mat this and the discussion later in mat suggest that jesus has a very specific view of the law in mind and that when he talks about maintaining the law in its full strength he is thinking of these aspects of it paul s conclusion is similar while he talks about the law being superceded all of the specific examples he gives involve the ceremonial law such as circumcision and the sabbath he is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards the net result of this is that when paul talks about the law being superceded and jesus talks about the law being maintained i believe they are talking about different aspects of the law paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision as is natural in letters responding to specific situations he s looking at the aspect of the law that is currently causing trouble the law as specifically jewish ceremonies he certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct on the other hand when jesus commends the law he seems to be talking the law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give paul so much trouble it s unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways but we should be familiar with that from current conflicts look at the way terms like family values take on special meaning from the current context imagine some poor historian of the future trying to figure out why family values should be used as a code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the u s i think law had taken on a similar role in the arguments paul was involved in paul was clearly not rejecting all of the jewish values that go along with the term law any more than people who concerned about the family values movement are really opposed to family values clh

re sspx schism from jhpb sarto budd lake nj us joseph h buehler many catholics will decide to side with the pope there is some soundness in this because the papacy is infallible so eventually some pope will straighten all this out but on the other hand there is also unsoundness in this in that in the short term the popes may indeed be wrong and such catholics are doing nothing to help the situation by obeying them where they re wrong in fact if the situation is grave enough they sin in obeying him at the very least they re wasting a great opportunity because they are failing to love christ in a heroic way at the very time that he needs this badly joe your logic excapes me if the papacy is infallible and this is a matter of faith then the pope cannot be wrong if on the other hand this is not a matter of faith but a matter of church law then we should still obey as the pope is the legal head of the church in other words given the doctrine of infallibility we have no choice but to obey bob bob van cleef peace be revc garg campbell ca us the land of garg bbs unto you bbs you might want to look at the faq on infallibility the doctrine on infallibility does not say that the pope is always right all catholic theologians acknowledge that there have been a number of occasions when the pope was wrong there appear to be two aspects to infallibility one is a general concept that in the long run the church is protected from serious error however this does not mean that it s impossible for it to take wrong turns at one time or another the more specific concept of papal infallibility is that in very specific circumstances a papal statement can be known to be infallible however a relatively small fraction of statements meet those criteria this does not absolve catholics from the duty to obey even ordinary teachings of the pope however only a few teachings are made in a way that is explicitly infallible clh

this let me go ahead and tell you that though it may sound it this is not one of those boy meets girl problem at least not totally like that to me anyway ok i am a year old sophmore at ncsu about years ago my family and i were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we rented across the street was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw me her name in erin well we became friends that week at the beach and have been writing each other for about years there was a period of about years we lost contact but that was a while ago by the way erin lives in kansas and me in nc ok last year in one of her letters she says that she is coming back to nc to see some of her family who are gonna be there so i drove about hours to see her this is where it begins i spent the whole day with erin one of the best days of my life even though we had been writing each other we still had to get used to being in person she has got to be the most incredible woman i ever met she s one year older than me btw i mean no person in the world could ask for a better person not only was she incredibly beautiful not to mention way out of my league although i m not unattractive mind you but she had a great personality and a great sence of humor her family is one of those families who goes to church but that is about the extent of their christianity you know the kind of people but she knows i am a christian well you get the idea of what i think of her if there is ever such a thing as love at first sight i found it that was last year i kid you not when i say that i have thought about her every day since then in out letters erin and i always kid each other about not finding dates which is true for me but i know it can t be for her she has had some problems at home her folks split up and she ended up leaving school now we are at the present let me give you part of the letter i got from her last week okay now i m going to try to explain my life to you i m not going to ku anymore because something just isn t right college just wasn t clicking with me here greek life is really big here and that just isn t my way i wasn t taking any classes that truly interested me i really have no idea of what i want to do with my life i was interested in something medical physical therpy i love working with kids but it just didn t work for me at this university and my parents could tell so i m working full time at the bass store bass shoes that is and now i have a part time job at a local daycare i work in the infant room m w f i ve really enjoyed it so far it spices up my week a little bit and it s great experience as of now i m not planning on going back to school in the very near future the main reason being my indecision on what i want to study but i definatley plan on going back within the next couple of years where i have no idea except for one thing it won t be to kansas right noew i m discussing a promotion with my boss and district manager it looks like i ll train at the store i work at now for about months as assistant manager and when that s done i ll basically be given a list of stores newly or soon to be built to chose where i would like to manage i ve pretty much decided on either one of the carolinas hopeully close to the beach wouldn t it be fun to actually see each other more than once every few years what do you think abou that i would like to know your opinion this job would pretty much be temporary but it is very good pay and any thye of management experience would look good on an application or resume the company is solid and treats it employees very well good benefits bonuses medical plans plus after year of full time service they will reimburse tuition i do have school money waitng for me but this will help especially since i will probably end up paying out of state tuition wherever i go chris i really would like to know what you think of my decision i respect your opinion i ve been completely lost for what to do for soooo long that when the opportunity came along it sounded really good i do like my job although i m about sure that i want to do more with my life than reatil management but it is something i don t think earning about a year for a year old female is too bad anyway onto your career decisions i ll solve your problem right now marry me you can do your pilot thing i like to be by myself sometimes seriously or not as seriously do what will make you the happiest worry about the home life later ok well i m sure you see what has got me so uptight what do you think she meant about the marraige thing i dream at night about marrying her and then she mentions it in her letter i don t know what to think since she wants to move to the carolina s should i search out a bass store near here and aske her to come to carolina i always pick on those people who graduate from high school and get married but what does she mean i ve had a lot of stress lately with exams and also the fact that i don t date beacause no time not that much that most college women are wrapped up in the social scene with the greeks whic as a christian i can t support and here she says she doesn t like the greek thing either maybe i m so stunned because there is actually a girl that i am so attracted to paying some real attention to me i mean what if she did move to nc what would i do i m only and she i m only a sophmore struggling through classes i have prayed about this over the past year from time to time saying god if she is the right one let the situation open up could this be my sign i would do anything to get her to nc here is some moree that makes it worse should i call her i m terrible over the phone i don t even like to talk to my friends here for longer than minutes i mean what would a girl as perfect as her want with a very average guy like me i m really confused i would really appreciate any help i can get thanx chris i have a feeling that it might be more appropriate to talk with chris directly via

when is a couple married i used to be a marriage commissioner for the alaska court system sort of a justice of the peace i had great difficulty with that duty i used to pray earnestly in the courthouse bathroom before the ceremonies mostly asking that the couples would come to appreciate and fulfill the true holiness and divine purpose in marriage couples who obviously didn t realize that marriage is god s institution not the state s gradually however i came to conclude that because i was acting in a strictly secular public capacity established as such by both the state and the expectations of the couples involved i was really conducting a purely secular legal civil event with no greater moral or religious implications than if i had been conducting a civil trial the couple who told me mid ceremony to please hurry it up may have helped me to this conclusion i thought i had neatly rationalized a clear and sharp distinction between marriage before god and marriage before the state until i had to deal with my own divorce keeping matthew in mind i felt that the state had no business dissolving my marriage established before god but of course it assumed jurisdiction nonetheless i would ask those of you proposing answers to this question to consider this issue s logical extension if intercourse or the mental intent of the parties or the ceremony of the church or any combination thereof establishes marriage then at what moment is it dissolved karl thoennes iii university of alaska

what s in a name the sequel i ve been thinking about the idea that was raised by michael covington i think that words mean what we think they mean regardless of etymology i ve been reflecting on what certain words meant in my childhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes i grew up in a home where christ was a bad word people who were very angry said it the word christian meant someone who was not a jew it carried connotations of otherness of threat of enemy it took some time to figure out that there was a connection between christ and christian when i accepted jesus i expected to be disowned to become a christian meant to join the enemy i knew others would consider me a traitor at some level i agreed but was still prepared to pay this price like esau i sold my birthright however i made a better bargain he only got some stew but i got the incomparable riches of knowing christ as it turned out my parents did not disown me i found out later that they were hoping it was a phase that i would grow out of by the time they had decided it wasn t a phase they were sort of used to it they didn t disown me but they didn t completely accept the situation either for example they didn t come to my wedding because it was in a church when i visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her death she said to me as far as i m concerned you still are a jew what she meant was that she loved me and forgave me but i am not a jew i am a christian i ll concede one that likes chicken soup with matzoh balls i do not keep kosher i do not celebrate the sabbath on saturday my sons are not circumcised but these things are true of some people who do consider themselves jews it is not these rules that make people jews it is the heritage from the past i gave up the past this is why i find it hard to relate to messianic jews their experience is unlike mine they still consider themselves jews while following jesus some would even say that i must do so too i am at a stage of my life now where i would like to have a heritage it was not something i valued very much when i gave it but i did have a sense that i was giving it for god it may have been a small sacrifice it may have been an unnecessary sacrifice but i gave it and do not want to ask for it back and while i don t have the heritage i was born with i do have another i am an outcast from the house of israel but i am a member of the church one of the things i like about being a catholic christian is that it is rich in tradition it gives me a feeling of once again being rooted in the past this is probably one of the reasons why i don t like it when people mess around with christian traditions for example changing the name of easter these traditions fill an important emotional need of mine i suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn t assume that all believers of jewish background are the same for some jewish christian is a good name for others it is an oxymoron jayne kulikauskas jayen mmalt guild org

re an agnostic s question perhaps you can tell your friend that you feel pressured by his continual discussions of this topic surely he doesn t feel you should be pressured into something you feel uncomfortable about since christianity should be a choice one should make on one s own please also realize that he is doing this out of friendship he probably feels you are missing out on something great and wants to tell you about it but since you know where you can learn about christianity you can tell him that it is now up to you to make that choice and if the choice is no you should be respected for that personally i believe that a christian s mission is just to be christ like showing his her own faith and happiness in that faith and make sure people know they are welcome to talk to you about it i do not believe in imposing your beliefs upon others but then again everyone s definitions of imposing may differ i hope i have made myself clear if not please correct me vera i am your clock i bind unto myself today vera noyes i am your religion the strong name of the noye midway uchicago edu i own you trinity no disclaimer what lard st patrick s breastplate is there to disclaim
re sspx schism here is some material by michael davies on the subject of schism in general and archishop lefebvre in particular he wrote it around the first part of the two part article was on the scandalous activities of archbishop weakland in this country but i cut all that and i pared down the rest to what was relevant joe buehler schism and disobedience according to st thomas aquinas schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the pope or communion with the members of the church united to him on first sight it would appear that whatever the subjective motivation of the archbishop as discussed above he must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to the pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of jurisdiction however standard catholic textbooks of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of disobedience are schismatic if this were so as was noted at the beginning of this article it would mean that the number of american bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures the distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative dictionnaire de theologie catholique the article is by father yves congar who is certainly no friend of archbishop lefebvre he explains that schism and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused father congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the church for example luther s rejection of the papacy father congar explains that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not constitute schism but disobedience the catholic encyclopedia explains that for a catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend to sever himself from the church as far as in him lies it adds that not every disobedience is schism in order to possess this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superiors a denial of their divine right to command not only does mgr lefebvre not deny the divine right of the pope to command but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the pope s authority and his intention of never breaking away from rome the archbishop made his attitude clear in the july august issue of days we pray for the pope every day nothing has changed with the consecrations last june we are not sedevacantists we recognize in john paul ii the legitimate pope of the catholic church we don t even say that he is a heretical pope we only say that his modernist actions favor heresy intrinsically schismatic the principal argument used by those claiming that mgr lefebvre is in schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is an intrinsically schismatic act a bishop who carries out such a consecration it is claimed becomes ipso facto a schismatic this is not true if such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involved the penalty of excommunication in the code of canon law the offence was punished only by suspension see canon of the code pope pius xii had raised the penalty to excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in china the consecration of these illicit chinese bishops differed radically from the consecrations carried out by mgr lefebvre as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the pope that is to deny that he has the right to govern the church and the illicitly consecrated chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise an apostolic mission neither archbishop lefebvre nor any of the bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of jurisdiction they have been consecrated solely for the purpose of ensuring the survival of the society by carrying out ordinations and also to perform confirmations i do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by mgr lefebvre the consecration of bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the roman pontiff but the archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the church could not be more grave and that grave measures were needed in response it appears to be taken for granted by most of the archbishop s critics that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism and the vatican has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression there is not so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation the new code of canon law includes a section beginning with canon entitled penalties for specific offenses de poenis in singula dicta the first part deals with offenses against religion and the unity of the church de delictis contra religionem et ecclesiae unitatem canon deals with the offense of schism which is evidently together with apostasy and heresy one of the three fundamental offenses against the unity of the church but the archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this canon or indeed under any canon involving an offense against religion or the unity of the church the canon cited in his excommunication comes from the third section of penalties for specific offenses which is entitled usurpation of ecclesial functions and offenses in their exercise de munerum ecclesiasticorum usurpatione degue delictis iniis exercendis the canon in question is canon which reads a bishop who consecrates someone bishop and the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical mandate incur an automatic latae sententiae excommunication reserved to the holy see the scandalous attempts to smear archbishop lefebvre with the offense of schism are then contrary to both truth and charity a comparable smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involving massive damages an accurate parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had been convicted of first degree murder i must stress that what i have written here is not the dubious opinion of laymen unversed in the intricacies of canon law canon lawyers without the least shred of sympathy for mgr lefebvre have repudiated the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable father patrick yaldrini dean of the faculty of canon law of the institut catholique in paris noted in the july issue of valeurs actuelles that as i have just explained mgr lefebvre was not excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function he added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrated bishop it is this usurpation of the powers of the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a parallel church cardinal rosalio lara president of the pontifical commission for the authentic interpretation of canon law commented on the consecrations in the july issue of la repubblica it would be hard to imagine a more authoritative opinion the cardinal wrote the act of consecrating a bishop without a papal mandate is not in itself a schismatic act in fact the code that deals with offenses is divided into two sections one deals with offenses against religion and the unity of the church and these are apostasy schism and heresy consecrating a bishop with a pontifical mandate is on the contrary an offense against the exercise of a specific ministry for example in the case of the consecrations carried out by the vietnamese archbishop ngo dinh thuc in and although the archbishop was excommunicated he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because there was no intention of a breach with the church it is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating bishops without a papal mandate archbishop lefebvre had the least intent of establishing a schismatic church he is not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic the archbishop considers correctly that the the church is undergoing its worst crisis since the arian heresy and that for the good of the church it was necessary for him to consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his society canon law provides for just such a situation and even if one believes that the future of the society could have been guaranteed without these consecrations the fact that the archbishop believed sincerely that it could not means as canon law states clearly that he has not incurred excommunication furthermore while the vatican allows such prelates as archbishop weakland to undermine the faith with impunity it cannot expect catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a great and orthodox archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to the service of the church and the salvation of souls dr eric m de saventhem president of the international una voce association is one of the best informed laymen in the church and he knows the archbishop intimately dr de saventhem like myself has no greater desire than to see a reconciliation between mgr lefebvre and the holy see during the archbishop s lifetime a quotation from a statement by dr de saventhem which was published in the february remnant merits careful study in retrospect the road leading to the consecrations of june appears more paved with grave roman and unfortunately also papal omissions than with lefebvrist obstinancies and from the eyes of an informed public this cannot be hidden by attempting to present the archbishop s act of grave disobedience as an offense against the faith it is said today that mgr lefebvre has an erroneous concept of tradition if this were so cardinal ratzinger could not on behalf of the pope have addressed to the archbishop the following words in his letter of july your ardent desire to safeguard tradition by procuring for it the means to live and prosper testifies to your attachment to the faith of all time the holy father understands your concern and shares it
re atheist s views on christianity was re accepting jeesus in your heart jason smith jasons atlastele com wrote the discussion begins why does the universe exist at all one of the laws of nature specifying cause and effect seems to dictate at least to this layman s mind there must be a causal event no reasonable alternative exists i would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime causes precede their effects but if you claim that there must be an answer to how did the universe our spacetime emerge from nothing science has some good candidates for an answer i have always wondered why christians use the there are questions science or atheism cannot answer argument i hope this is the appropriate group to ask this question the most popular question is the question of origins why does the universe exist or anything for that matter i think this question should actually be split into two parts namely why is there existence why anything exists and how did the universe emerge from nothing it is clear science has nothing to say about the first question however is it a meaningful question after all i would say it isn t consider the following a die hard skeptic being be it human or whatever attempts to doubt one s very existence since it is so easy to doubt everything else i cannot be sure the world exists it may be my mind fooling me can i ever be sure i exist however it is only possible to exist or not to exist someone insert an appropriate shakespeare quote here a being that does not exist cannot doubt one s existence a being that does exist can doubt one s existence but this would be pointless the being would exist anyway let us return to the original question why a being that does not exist does not need any reasons for its non existence this being is not sure whether anything else exists but his mind but let us assume that the world exists independent of the mind the objectivity postulate the question why anything exists can be countered by demanding answer to a question why there is nothing in nothingness or in non existence actually both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning things that exist do and things that don t exist don t exist tautology at its best i seriously doubt god could have an answer to this question some christians i have talked to have said that actually god is himself the existence however i see several problems with this answer first it inevitably leads to the conclusion that god is actually all existence good and evil devils and angels us and them this is pantheism not christianity another answer is that god is the source of all existence this sounds much better but i am tempted to ask does god himself exist then if god is the source of his own existence it can only mean that he has in terms of human time always existed but this is not the same as the source of all existence this argument sounds like god does not exist but meta exists and from his meta existent perspective he created existence i think this is actually a nonsolution a mere twist of words the best answer i have heard is that human reasoning is incapable of understanding such questions being an atheist myself i do not accept such answers since i do not have any other methods the second question how did the universe emerge from nothing belongs to the domain of science and i for one do not doubt the question can be answered by its methods many cosmologists have suggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge from vacuum this possibility has been suggested in a recent hawking biography see also lizhi shuxian creation of the universe world scientific however i think the sci groups are more appropriate for discussions like this as far as i can tell the very laws of nature demand a why that isn t true of something outside of nature i e super natural this is not true science is a collection of models telling us how not why something happens i cannot see any good reason why the why questions would be bound only to natural things assuming that the supernatural domain exists if supernatural beings exist it is as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist i believe the genetic code will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining reproducing life ever i ve never been much of a prophet though i can t even picture new york in my mind i don t believe any technology would be able to produce that necessary spark of life despite having all of the parts available just my opinion this opinion is also called vitalism namely that living systems are somehow fundamentally different from inanimate systems do christians in general adopt this position what would happen when scientists announce they have created primitive life say small bacteria in a lab there is a problem with your prophecy artificial life has been created although not yet in a chemical form computer simulations of evolution contain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium although their code is electronic as well as their metabolism see a recent book steven levy artificial life the quest for a new creation jonathan cape london artificial chemical life is just around the corner after all no spark of life has been found to be necessary living systems do not violate any physical laws as we know them you don t mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your research do you after all if we of christ are deluding ourselves you really have nothing to worry about eh exactly this is why i think atheists should not post any evangelical atheist arguments to soc religion groups since people who seek to find peace in religions must be allowed to gather together i

re a question that has bee bothering me wquinnan sdcc ucsd edu malcusco writes my problem with science is that often it allows us to assume we know what is best for ourselves god endowed us with the ability to produce life through sexual relations for example but he did not make that availible to everyone does that mean that if science can over ride god s decision through alterations that god wills for us to have the power to decide who should and should not be able to have children should men be allowed to have babies if that is made possible in a word yes i don t believe that physical knowledge has a great deal of impact on the power of god in the past god gave us the ability to create life through sexual relations now he is giving us the ability to create life through in vitro fertilization the difference between the two is merely cosmetic and even if we gain the ability to create universes we won t begin to approach the glory of god the power we are being given is a test and i am sure that in many cases we will use our new abilities unwisely but people have been using sexuality unwisely for millenia and i haven t heard an outcry to abolish it yet no matter how far we extend our dominion over the physical world we aren t impinging on god s power it s only when we attempt to gain control of the spiritual world those things that can t be approached through science and logic that we begin to interfere with god alan terlep and the scorpion says it s oakland university rochester mi in my nature atterlep vela acs oakland edu
re the arrogance of christians phs d vaxc cc monash edu au writes in article apr athos rutgers edu aa freenet carleton ca mark baker writes this is not true the athiest s position is that there is no proof of the existence of god as much as some people accept their church their priests or straight from their own scriptures as the proof this does not satisfy atheists you haven t fully explained the atheist position many theists believe that there is no proof of the existence of god but choose to believe in him anyway i haven t yet found an argument for atheism that can t quickly be broken down to unprovable assumptions this isn t a problem with me everybody needs to have a faith but if you believe that you can provide a purely logical argument for the nonexistence of god i d really like to see it are you asking us to believe blindly you are trying to deny that part of us that makes us ask the question does god exist i e self awareness and reason if we do not use our ability to reason we become as ignorant as the other animals on this earth does god want us to be like that you are right that science and reason cannot prove anything however if we do not use them we can only then believe on faith alone and since we can only use faith why is one picture of god e g hinduism any less valid than another e g christianity ahh but when you use science and reason you have faith in certain beliefs of the scientific method for example the physical laws of the universe are stable our observations of reality are a valid basis for a determination of truth objective reality exists logical argument is a valid way to answer all questions can you prove any of these alan terlep and the scorpion says it s oakland university rochester mi in my nature atterlep vela acs oakland edu
re being right about messiahs desiree bradley mindlink bc ca desiree bradley writes and from my meagre knowledge of the bible it seems that christians have been hard on the jews of christ s day for being cautious about accepting somebody that their religious authorities didn t accept as the messiah this is a good point christ was hardly the only person who claimed to be the messiah in fact a number of messiahs were active in the area from the time of the roman conquest to after the fall of masada many of the statements made by the apostles especially their repeated attempts to give jesus a sword give him military power point to the fact that they didn t realize the true nature of his reign until after the fact many of the statements in the bible can be seen as being oriented toward explaining this new definition of messiah to the jews who were being preached to alan terlep and the scorpion says it s oakland university rochester mi in my nature atterlep vela acs oakland edu
atheists and hell hello i have seen two common threads running through postings by atheists on the newsgroup and i think that they can be used to explain each other unfortunately i don t have direct quotes handy atheists believe that when they die they die forever a god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death is unfair i don t see what the problem is to christians hell is by definition eternal death exactly what atheists are expecting when they die there s no reason hell has to be especially awful to most people eternal death is bad enough literal interpreters of the bible will have a problem with this view since the bible talks about the fires of hell and such personally i don t think that people in hell will be thrust into flame any more than i expect to jesus with a double edged sword issuing from his mouth i treat both these statements as metaphorical alan terlep and the scorpion says it s oakland university rochester mi in my nature atterlep vela acs oakland edu rushing in where angels fear to tread jody

re sabbath admissions of in response to some of the discussions on the sabbath andrew byler commented that if we really followed sola scriptura we would worship on saturday the change to sunday was a law made by the church and we don t acknowledge its authority to make laws i noted that protestants do not consider sunday worship a law clh he was not referring to the faq but to the five sabbath admissions posted on the bible study group this is what prompted someone to send the faq to me the argument against the sabbath is that it is part of the ceremonial law and like the rest of the n ceremonial law is not binding on christians you cannot show from scripture that the weekly sabbath is part of the ceremonial laws before you post a text in reply investigate its context if you accept that the sabbath is not binding on christians then the day of worship falls into the category of items on which individual christians or since worship is by its nature a group activity churches are free to decide can the churches also decide what is and is not sin interesting where there is no divine imperative of course we must establish rules of operation but we cannot be as creative with what god has explicitly spoken on darius again in the normal protestant interpretation sunday is not a law and worshipping on another day is not a sin churches are free to decide on the day they will meet just as they are free to decide on the hour it would not be a sin to worship on some other day but if you belong to a church that worships on sunday and you show up on monday you will probably worship alone clh

assurance of hell i dreamed that the great judgment morning had dawned and the trumpet had blown i dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment before the white throne oh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fate they cried for the rock and the mountains they prayed but their prayers were too late the soul that had put off salvation not tonight i ll get saved by and by no time now to think of religion alas he had found time to die and i saw a great white throne now some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good for motivation yet jesus thought it was paul thought it was paul said knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men today too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of it is nothing but evangelical salesmanship we don t tell people anymore that there s such a thing as sin or that there s such a place as hell as jayne has said this doesn t mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit people over the head with a baseball bat yet the fact remains there is a place called hell a place so fearful that god died to save us from having to experience it whatever you or i as christians do we should do whatever we can to win people to the lord if for no other reason to keep them from going to outer darkness jesus in mt tells us that he didn t prepare hell for people he prepared it for the devil and his angels no where in the bible do i read anywhere that god predestined anybody to go to hell d l moody use to say that the elect are the whosoever will and the nonelect are the whosoever wont s whether or not that s theologically sound i couldn t defend but its practical jesus said to the people of israel ye would not now some of you may not be students of the bible heck some of you may not be christians have you ever said to somebody i don t believe in hell i believe in the religion of jesus but did you know that jesus talked more about hell than he did about heaven oh i believe in the religion of the sermon on the mount you find hell taught by jesus in the sermon on the mount you ll read that jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire several times he talks about hell and about judgment in fact over and over in the synoptics matthew mark and luke jesus talks about hell not isaiah not moses not john the baptist though he did but jesus the son of god the great beloved one preached about hell because he loved people and didn t want to see them go there now if there is no hell then jesus preached in vain it was our lord jesus not some angry baptist preacher that said where the worm never dies and where the fire never goes out jesus said that it was jesus who called hell a furnace of fire it was jesus that used the word condemnation and this is the condemnation that men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil jesus said that how can we get it across to you that a loving dying jesus preached about hell not only that but he went through hell that s what calgary was all about when my lord was on the cross darkness fell he called hell outer darkness do you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over here the drunks are getting drunk over there and the prostitutes are prostituting their bodies over there that s not what hell is hell s not a party there s no fellowship there he called it outer darkness outer away from god darkness god is light no when he was on the cross he was made sin for you and for me god treated jesus the way sinners have to be treated that s is a sobering thought as my son would say an awesome thought my god my god why hast thou forsaken me hell is isolation there s no fellowship in hell there s no friendship in hell there s no loving embrace in hell there s no hand shake in hell there s no word of encouragement in hell i thirst it goes much deeper than physical thirst hell is eternal craving with no satisfaction the man whose life was lived for drugs will crave it eternally the man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman s body will crave it eternally and not be satisfied one theologian has put it this way and i think it deserves merit what is hell hell is just the kind of environment that matches the internal condition of the lost in a recent post i was trying to remember the founder of the word of life ministries i ve remembered his name jack wertzen and found that the illustration that i gave wasn t his his illustration was that he was talking to his barber and his barber s wife and daughter had just recently been saved and he was commenting about it to jack they sing these songs and read bible verses and their praising this and that i can t stand it jack do you think god would send me to hell jack answered by saying yes i think he would of course the barber said what do you mean by that well if you can t stand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to god now what would you do in heaven where they ll do it for eternity you d be miserable because god loves you he d put you where it would match what you really are it makes a man think the crucifixion of jesus christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal existence of hell because on the cross he performed an eternal act don t ask me how i don t know but he is god and he is the infinite eternal and when he died he died an infinite eternal death it is by that eternal act that he purchased eternal life for the whosoever wills he suffered eternal judgment a lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying everybody is going to be saved eventually universalism my bible says no he ll separate them the sheep from the goats after you die there s a probationary period in which god prepares you for heaven no my bible says that it is appointed unto men once to die and then comes judgment some of the cultist believe in annihilation after you die sssswish just like a mosquito you re squished out no in rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as there is in heaven i don t enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don t enjoy listening to them but we have to preach the entire word of god there is a place called hell if i could give one verse of scripture that could give any hope that people aren t going there i d give it to you but i haven t found it that fact that there is a place called hell the fact that our god is a god of holiness and must judge sin the fact that he has made us the kind of creatures we are and therefore we re responsible the fact that he has placed us in a uni verse that has purpose and design behind it the fact that sin is such an awful thing and the fact that god himself went through hell to save us from hell leads us to two applications as i ve already mentioned if you are a christian you must worn others its not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just around the bend the bridge is out knowing therefore the terror of lord we persuade men if you haven t accepted jesus are your savior you re taking an awful chance as i say to the jehovah witnesses who no longer frequent my door if you are right and i am wrong then i will have lived a good life and will die and cease to exist but if i am right and you are wrong then you will die and suffer eternal damnation i don t mean to make fun at this point but its like dirty harry said you ve got to ask yourself do i feel lucky well do you a man s got to know his limitations don t be one of the whosoever wont s because while i was yet a sinner he died for me there s no greater love than this that a man lay down his life for another rex
re sabbath admissions of i find it interesting that cls never answered any of the questions posed then he goes on the make statements which make me shudder he has established a two tiered god one set of rules for the jews his people and another set for the saved gentiles his people why would god discriminate does the jew who accepts jesus now have to live under the gentile rules god has one set of rules for all his people paul was never against the law in fact he says repeatedly that faith establishes rather that annuls the law paul s point is germane to both jews and greeks the law can never be used as an instrument of salvation and please do not combine the ceremonial and moral laws in one in matt christ plainly says what he came to do and you say he was only saying that for the jews s benefit your christ must be a politician speaking from both sides of his mouth as paul said i have not so learned christ forget all the theology just do what jesus says your excuses will not hold up in a court of law on earth far less in god s judgement hall darius
re sabbath admissions of again in the normal protestant interpretation sunday is not a law and worshipping on another day is not a sin churches are free to decide on the day they will meet just as they are free to decide on the hour it would not be a sin to worship on some other day but if you belong to a church that worships on sunday and you show up on monday you will probably worship alone clh i totally agree with that sentiment but why do you have to go further and advocate violating what god has set up that is the question which you have not answered from scripture you can worship on every day as long as you work but god says the sabbath is all mine darius

re atheists and hell atterlep vela acs oakland edu writes hello i have seen two common threads running through postings by atheists on the newsgroup and i think that they can be used to explain each other unfortunately i don t have direct quotes handy atheists believe that when they die they die forever true to a point if you were to ask a buddhist atheist a god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death is unfair i don t see what the problem is to christians hell is by definition eternal death exactly what atheists are expecting when they die there s no reason hell has to be especially awful to most people eternal death is bad enough actually yes and no hell is eternal death actually the way i ve had it related to me it s more of an eternal damnation where sinners will feel the licking flames of hell if i supposedly can feel these flames i would assume i m still alive but suffering and away from god literal interpreters of the bible will have a problem with this view since the bible talks about the fires of hell and such personally i don t think that people in hell will be thrust into flame any more than i expect to jesus with a double edged sword issuing from his mouth i treat both these state ments as metaphorical i believe jehovah s witnesses have a similar view where the body sleeps for ever i don t have a problem with being condemned to hell either the way i see it if god wants to punish me for being honest in my skepticism that is for saying he doesn t exist he certainly wouldn t be changing his nature besides i would rather spend an eternity in hell than be beside god in heaven knowing even one man would spend his eternal life being scorched for his wrongdoings stephen atheist libertarian pro individuality pro responsibility jr and all that jazz

re certainty and arrogance in article apr geneva rutgers edu kilroy gboro rowan edu dr nancy s sweetie writes someone called rexlex has claimed that there is a way out of the loop but he did not bother to explain what it was preferring instead to paraphrase sartre ramble about wittgenstein and say that the conclusion of my argument leads to relativism i will answer this as i find time rexlex suggested that people read he is there and he is not silent by francis schaeffer i didn t think very highly of it but i think that mr schaeffer is grossly overrated by many evangelical christians somebody else might like it though so don t let my opinion stop you from reading it if someone is interested in my opinion i d suggest on certainty by ludwig wittgenstein darren f provine kilroy gboro rowan edu if any substantial number of talk religion misc readers read some wittgenstein of the postings would disappear if they understood some wittgenstein would disappear michael l siemon notice what i said about this book i called it easy reading the reason i dropped philosphy as my major was because i ran into too many pharisaical simon s i don t know how many walking encyclopedia s i ran across in philosphy classes the problem isn t in knowing sooooo much more than your average lay person the problem comes when you become puffed up about it schaeffer is just fine for the average lay person that was who he was writting to i suppose that you would have criticised john that his gospel was to simple i ve talked with schaeffer one on one i ve been in lectures with the man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and prof s from secular as well as christian universities nd alone would fill both those catagories his answers were enough that the prof s themselves often were taken back and caused to re think what their question was i saw this time and time again at different open forums so yes schaeffers books are by in large well simplistic it certainly isn t grad level reading but we must get off our high horses when it comes to recommended reading do you seriously think most people would get through the first chapter of wittgenstein i may have more to say about this secular scientist at another time also one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by insistent inquisitiveness one cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt base look the christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality but we must add a qualification to give this balance christianity is second to none in keeping reason in its place we never know the value of a thing until we know its limits put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust it of all value this is why xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic it also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism and not christian faith which leads to irrationality if we forget the limits of a thing we fly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic lesson of life more without limits is less less with limits is more or as i have so often stated it freedom without form soon becomes form w o freedom let s put it another way the rationality of faith is implacably opposed to absurdity but has no quarrel with mystery think about that it can tell the difference between the two if you will let it christianity s contention with rationalism is not that it has too much reason in it but that it has very little else when a christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust go hand in hand but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called to go on by itself without his understanding this is where the principle of suspended judgment applies at such time if the christian faith is to be itself and let god be god it must suspend judgment and say father i do not understand you but i trust you now don t read all your objections of me into that statement i wasn t saying i do not understand you at all but i trust you anyway it means that i do not understand you in this situation but i do understand why i trust you anyway therefore i can trust that you understand even though i do not the former is a mystery unrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity the latter is a statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of faith so the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational it is not a leap of faith but a walk of faith as believers we cannot always know why but we canalways know why we trust god who knows why and this makes all the difference now there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where i have parted company with philosophy what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit more difficult in practice in practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith like the insistent whying of a year old it isn t just that we would like to know what we do not know but that we feel we must know what we cannot know the one produces frustration because curiosity is denied the other leads to genuine anguish more specifically the poorer our understanding is in coming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after coming to faith if we do not know why we trust god then we will always need to know exactly what god is doing in order to trust him failing to grasp that we may not be able to trust him for anything we do not understand may count decisevely against what we are able to trust if on the other hand we do know why we trust god we will be able to trust him in situations where we do not understand what he is doing too many xian leaders teach as if the christian had a window in the back of his head which allows for understanding at every foot fall for what god is doing may be ambiguous but it will not be inherently contradictory it may be mystery to us but mystery is only inscrutable what would be insufferable is absurdity and that my friend was the conclusion of nietzche

article so dan johnson should be the st one in article athos rutgers edu jayne mmalt guild org jayne kulikauskas writes deletia no free gifts speil nuked by moderator fiat i find that i am dissatisfied with the little purposes that we can manufacture for ourselves little in the cosmic sense ah in the cosmic sence but who lives in the cosmic sence not me cosmicly we don t even exist for all practical purposes i can hardly use the cosmic sence of stuff as a guide to life it would just say don t bother luckily for mortals there are many sences of scale you can talk about in a human sence you can have big purposes even the greatest of the great pharos are long gone the pyramids historical oddities being worn down by the wind eventually to be turned into dust but the influence of aristotle confucious alexander ceasar and countless others is still with us although their works have perished but they have changed to course of history and while humanity exists their deeds cannot be said to have come to nothing even if they are utterly forgotten mankind itself will one day perish one day surely well unless you believe in the second coming which i do not but in that time we can make a difference without some interconnectedness that transcends the physical without god it is all pointless in the end in the end but it must be the end until then there is all the point you can muster and when that end comes there will be nobody to ask gee i don t think james sledd s deeds are gonna make much of a difference ulitmately ya know but they will have already have made a difference great or small before the end why must your ends be eternal to be worthwhile most people are able to live with that and for them little purposes success money power effecting change helping others suffice little is in the eye of the beholder of course i suppose they never think about the cosmic scale or are at least able to put it out of their minds i don t doubt it but i have thought about the cosmic scale and it does not seem to mean much to us here today to me it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion i would not find this comforting but perhaps it is merely my definitions here s what i think the relevant terms are reality that which is real illusion that which is not real but seems to be real objectively existing for reality to be an illusion would mean then that which is real is not real but seems to be or that which objectively exists does not objectively exist but does seem to objectively exist from which we can conclude that unless you want to get a contradiction that no things objectively exist but i have a problem with this because i would like to say that i objectively exist if nothing else cogito ergo sum and all that perhaps you do not mean all that but rather mean objective reality is unreachable by humans which is not so bad and so far as i know is true that the true reality underneath the the physical is spirit have on if reality is an illusion isn t true reality an illusion too and if true reality is spirit doens t that make spirit an illusion as well if i am not distinctly confused this is getting positively buddhist that this world is a school of sorts where we learn and grow and our souls mature that is one hell of a statement although perhaps true do you mean to imply that it was intended to be so if so please show that this is true if not please explain how this can give a purpose to anything that gives a purpose to my little purposes how does it do that wouldn t the world school w intent idea make the world a preparation for some greater purpose rather than a purpose in itself and takes some of the pressure off what pressure it s not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms if you re really just here to learn it is not necessary to be a success in human terms unless your goals either include doing so or require doing so before they themselves can be achived indeed many people have set goals for themselves that do not include success in human terms as i understand it check out yer buddhist monk type guy out for nirvana which is not at all the same thing it s more important to progress grow persist to learn to love yourself and others and to express your love especially when it s dificult to do so honest effort is rewarded by god he knows our limitations why is learning to love a goal what happens if you fail in this goal to you to god to the mysterious purpose deletia question about immortailty and my answer deleted because it was mostly quote two serious questions invitations to discussion what is the nature of eternal life how can we as mortals locked into space time conceive of it possible answer for the best we can do is metaphor analogy question a what is the best metaphor i ll have a crack at that the nature of eternal life is neatly described by its name it is the concept of life without death life without end no we can put together word to describe it but we cannot imagine it a no metaphor is adequate next to eternity if it were we could not understand it either or so i suspect dan johnson and god said jeeze this is dull and it was dull genesis

re sabbath admissions of in article apr athos rutgers edu pharvey quack kfu com paul harvey writes priority than the direct word of jesus in matt paul begins romans with if someone is weak in the faith do you count yourself as one who is weak in the faith do you count yourself as one who is weak in the faith you read jesus word in matt is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is sin greek hamartia missing the mark is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is missing the mark however i d like to be clear that i do not think there s unambiguous proof that regular christian worship was on the first day as i indicated there are responses on both of the passages cited whereas the ten commandments and jesus words in matt are fairly clear are they not are they clear or do you have doubts no i don t believe that paul can overrule god an important first step the realization that paul was human however paul was writing for a largely gentile audience yes and he was writing and speaking for an audience that was at best very weak in the faith most could not read most were unfamiliar with the hebrew scriptures in even the septuagint form paul adapted the message of the bible to a largely uneducated market granted this market still exists today but do you count yourself as part of it to be weak in the faith is not missing the mark hamartia if you do the best that your education allows are you doing the best the law was regarded by jews at the time and now as binding on jews but not on gentiles there are rules that were binding on all human beings the so called noachic laws but they are quite minimal let me make clear that the law is none other than the pentateuch of genesis exodus leviticus numbers deuteronomy what did jesus say about the law in matt where did jesus say that the law only applies to jews and that gentiles are above the law the issue that the church had to face after jesus death was what to do about gentiles who wanted to follow christ the decision not to impose the law on them didn t say that the law was abolished it simply acknowledged that fact that it didn t apply to gentiles who acknowledged this fact on what basis are we extra biblical at this point why not also acknowledge that the bhagavad gita is the only relevant text for gentiles after all we see in the bible that it was magus from the east who observed the star signs of jesus why bother with any texts at all why not just follow whatever the church has to say thus there is no contradiction with mat i don t see how you can say this with a straight face are you a follower of christ or do you follow someone else are you saying that the words of jesus only apply to jews as far as i can tell both paul and other jewish christians did continue to participate in jewish worship on the sabbath thus they continued to obey the law how jewish was paul after he changed his name from saul the issue was and is with gentile christians who are not covered by the law or at least not by the ceremonial aspects of it who says gentile christians are not covered by the first five books who says that gentile christians are above the ten commandments jesus dealt mostly with jews i think we can reasonably assume that mat was directed to a jewish audience you re implying that jesus words are valid only for jews is this really what you mean to say you do realize that you are gutting rather large portions of the bible when you read jesus words did you ever consider that maybe just maybe jesus is talking to you no matter what your race or sex if the hebrew scriptures and the gospel accounts of jesus are only directed to jews why were they translated into english he did interact with gentiles a few times e g the centurion whose slave was healed and a couple of others the terms used to describe the centurion see luke suggest that he was a god fearer i e a gentile who followed god but had not adopted the whole jewish law as paul would call him one who was weak in the faith he was commended by jewish elders as a worthy person and jesus accepted him as such this seems to me to indicate that jesus accepted the prevailing view that gentiles need not accept the law which is more important the recorded word of jesus or indications that you can deduce from the bible was jesus god only of the jews or god of all humankind of all race and sex however there s more involved if you want to compare jesus and paul on the law in order to get a full picture of the role of the law we have to come to grips with paul s apparent rejection of the law and how that relates to jesus commendation of the law at least as i read paul he says that the law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded this is your understanding of paul compare this to the word of jesus are you christian or pauline again this issue isn t one of the abolition of the law in the middle of his discussion paul notes that he might be understood this way and assures us that that s not what he intends to say rather he sees the law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness but ultimately it s an impossible standard and one that has been superceded by christ again this is your understanding of paul did jesus say that the law was an impossible standard did jesus say that he superceded the law are you christian or pauline paul s comments are not the world s clearest here and not everyone agrees with my reading you acknowledge that it is your reading of paul what did jesus say can you deny that matt is quite clear in its meaning are you christian or pauline but the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the law it still remains as an uncompromising standard from which not an iota or dot may be removed for its purpose of convicting of sin it s important that it not be relaxed when did jesus say that the purpose of the law was conviction of sin however for christians it s not the end ultimately we live in faith not law please reread matt are you christian or pauline jesus interpretations emphasize the intent of the law and stay away from the ceremonial details are you saying that the ten commandments are ceremonial details paul s conclusion is similar while he talks about the law being superceded all of the specific examples he gives involve the ceremonial law such as circumcision and the sabbath he is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards you call observance of the sabbath the day on which the lord rested ceremonial has circumcision been superceded for christians are you christian or pauline both there is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is not at least not in this case jesus did not deal explicitly with the question of whether the law was binding on gentiles that s why i have to cite evidence such as the way jesus dealt with the centurion as to general jewish views on this i am dependent largely on studies of pauline theology one by h j schoeps and one whose author i can t come up with at the moment both authors are jews also various christian and non christian jews have discussed the issue here and in other newsgroups mat is clear that the law is still valid it does not say that it applies to gentiles and yes i say that the specific requirement for worship on the sabbath in the ten commandments is a ceremonial detail when you re looking at the obligations of gentiles similarly circumcision i m not sure quite what else i can say on this subject again it s unfortunate the jesus didn t answer the question directly however we do know what the st cent jewish approach was how jesus dealt with at least one gentile and how jesus disciples dealt with the issue when it became more acute i m referring to acts more than paul given that these are all in agreement i don t see that there s a big problem clh

latest on branch davidians most of you will have probably seen the news by the time you read this but the branch davidian compound is no more this morning about the feds punched holes in the compound walls by using a tank they then started using non lethal tear gas shortly after noon cult members were seen setting fire to the compound so far about people have been seen outside the compound the fate of the other or people is unknown neither is the fate of the children that were inside the compound did burn to the ground koresh who at times has claimed to be the messiah but then backed off and only claimed to be a prophet had promised several times to come out peacefully if his demands were met first he demanded that his message be broadcast on the radio which it was but he didn t come out he claimed to be waiting for a message from god finally he said that god told him that he needed to decipher the mystery of the seals in revelation and when he was finished he d come out he finished the first one but didn t do any more work that anyone knows of since then the federal agents did warn him that if they didn t come out they would be subjected to tear gas i think it s really sad that so many people put their faith in a mere man even if he did claim to be the son of god and or a prophet i think it underscores the importance of putting you faith only in things that are eternal and knowing for yourself what the scriptures say and what they mean instead of relying on others to do it for you even if those others are learned and mean well paul conditt

refusing divine peace and alive prayer was re question about mary it s like refusing god s kingdom come in one of jesus revelation in this century same thing as in the old days people refuse to believe my messengers even when i was alive here on earth they refuse me what more when i am just talking through somebody else paraphrased with all the knowledge believers accumulated he would think that we would be enlightened enough to detect which ones are authentic and divine as opposed to evil or man made these signs these miracles are you afraid that they are not from god that these are the signs we should not open our hearts and mind to for thinking they are evil well is faith in god evil is true peace evil is true love that is divine and pure evil why can t someone accept that god can do what he wants in fulfillment of his generous love and jesus never ending forgiveness to those who turn back to him for salvation why are we refusing god s messenger of this truth the mother to all who are in christ what brings us these fears of being shamed by what others will think or say about us which in contrary could be pleasing to god fears of being humbled fears of being judged as wrong wrt mainstream standard of what is right why can t we tolerate non believers mockery or ridicule of us for the sake of peace love and obedience to god the humbling lessons left to us by martyrs and saints we d rather engage in never ending bickering and disproof of each other s opinion looking at each other s mistakes for the sake of arguments instead of having communion in one body with christ what makes us go blind to the truth that god is all powerful and that he can not be binded by what people wrote and have written about him in all ages why is our faith in god limited by all the words and literature we muster what prevents us from going beyond being saved and extend god s rich love to others who are not why are our eyes not wide open to see that he continuously sees our faith hope and love which glorify him and so he gives us indications of his acknowledgements with signs miracles ordinary common or divinely inspired everywhere isn t that like an atheist agnostic s view that all these are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural why then does the holy mother comes back to remind us we must really accept that prayer changes the course of things and that with prayers even wars can be prevented but then she continues you often have an egotistic attitude dear children in these days you have prayed very much but your hands have remained empty why hesitate in proclaiming what needs to be done prayer conversion peace penance fasting the holy mass living life as what the gospel brings why not do so how to the world to this the mother says start in your family be a good example live the word why worry if it is going to be of good use to many our holy mother says the fruits leave them to the lord do not worry about anything or anyone but entrust yourself to the lord although the holy mother does not insist because you are free i bow before the freedom which god gives you but she follows this with you are surprised because i say to you decide for god and yet see how you have lived this day why does she constantly conveys take this life toward god in the way as to experience the lord himself in your behavior and not only when you pray or one time when we decide that we are saved or talk write about god etc the holy mother warns satan the serpent is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from my peace plan and prayer rev the dragon became angry with the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings those who keep god s commandments and bear witness to jesus do you have fear or hate for god s current messenger of true peace love and our motherly protector from the anti christ the one who is being apprehensive of communism wars famine and other evils that the serpent brings upon us this obedient and blessed new eve the mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against satan haven t there been renewed faith hope love peace and obedience wherever this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that god has given her in good purpose why do we choose to be blind why fear the truth that god has been giving us a chance and sharing christ s ever forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother the mother who has been consecrated the task to reverse the disobedient harm and example done by the ancient eve she has been preparing the new eden with her immaculate heart the new eden as sanctuary the womb for the next coming and judgement of the righteous by our lord jesus christ when the lamb marries his bride shouldn t we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the second coming of her son as she has been conceived without sin to bear the son of god in her womb why fear true peace love and renewed faith and obedience to god that mary faithfully brings to god s children she has been protecting the flock the rest of the offsprings from the greedy dragon so as to present more righteous members for her son s coming not all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy of belief with prayer and guidance from the holy spirit and of course approval of our church authorities we should be aware of the true and divinely inspired ones specifically the ones which aligns with the scripture also our lady reminds us of recommendation of silence in our prayers if you speak unceasingly in your prayers how will you be able to hear god allow him room to answer you to speak to you she encourages us with motherly nurturing to continue in exuberant faith hope and love to jesus constantly not with mere emotions but with deep constant obedience to jesus her beloved son and acknowledgement of our need to have him as part of our lives let s not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the life that god wants us to live when there won t be enough time or when it will be late nowadays mary says pray pray pray for peace reconciliation my children have peace within yourself first before you can promote peace to others for without peace you can not fully accept my son and you think she s just an ordinary lady not to me she s our good mother messenger from god and she is so nice enough to share god s kingdom to us through her son and experience it with mary we are assured that the lamb always succeeds note all enclosed in quotes are from latest news of medjugorje number june by fr rene laurentin o new mother of eden most pure preparing the sanctuary for true christians cleansing us with peace for god s kingdom come bring us to your loving protective and obedient church that we may belong in one body to your

re so far so good this may be a really dumb one but i ll ask it anyways christians know that they can never live up to the requirements of god right i may be wrong but that is my understanding but they still try to do it doesn t it seem like we are spending all of our lives trying to reach a goal we can never achieve i know that we are saved by faith and not by works but does that mean that once we are saved we don t have to do anything i think james tells us that faith without works is dead paraphrase how does this work short reply we can never achieve perfect health yet we always strive for it we don t seek to do god s will because we re forced to we follow his way because his way is best the reason it s hard is because we are flawed not because he s unreasonable but we seek to follow his way because we want to improve ourselves and our lives mark
re tuff to be a christian please realize that i am frequently getting in trouble for straying from orthodoxy but here is my opinion in article apr geneva rutgers edu mdbs ms uky edu no name writes moreover the buddha says that we are intrinsically good as against christ s we are all sinners i never thought of these two ideas being against each other people might quibble about what intrinsically means but the reason we are sinners is because we do not behave as good as we are the message of christ is that each of us are not only good but great that we can approach perfection albeit perhaps through a different technique than you claim buddhism teaches because we do not realize our greatness we sin peter had no problem walking on water until a little doubt crept in doesn t david ask in the th psalm what is man that you god should care for him but you have made him just a little lower than the angels i probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid david was just as i probably exagerate what a gigantic monster goliath was but david s power easily defeated goliath s remember the rich young man who comes up to jesus and asks what he can do to enter the kingdom jesus says follow the commandments i always picture the smug look on his face as he says he s done that his whole life probably anticipating an attaboy from the messiah instead jesus gives him a harder task sell everything and follow him jesus is raising the bar the desciples say how can anyone do this if it s so hard even for rich people jesus says anyone can do it with god s help jesus says not only can we avoid killing people we can avoid getting angry at people not only can we avoid committing adultery we can control our own desires i realize this was not your main point but i wonder how other people see this parting question would you have become a christian if you had not been indoctrinated by your parents you probably never learned about any other religion to make a comparative study and therefore i claim you are brain washed please forgive any generalizations i am about to make your point about how hard other religions are is a good one just as your parting question is a tough question i think that muslims worship the same god as i do we can learn from their name submission hindus and buddhists and taoists etc claim that god is impersonal is god personal or impersonal i say yes but if i think a little more my answer is whichever is greater i think it is greater to be a personal entity with an individual consciousness but you re right that that might be a cultural bias if i think more i must admit that god s personal nature is as far beyond my conception as his impersonal nature is beyond the hindu s conception if somehow jesus could fit into hindu cosmology then maybe i wouldn t have a problem though that is hard to imagine are there any former or present eastern religion members here who could comment chris mussack

re sspx schism in article apr geneva rutgers edu jhpb sarto budd lake nj us joseph h buehler writes descriptions of true and false obedience obedience is not solely a matter of compliance refusal the nature of the commands must also be taken into account it is not enough to consider someone s compliance or refusal and then say whether they are obedient or disobedient you also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad you ask where we are i would echo that question i m not trying to be contentious but assuming that the pope has universal jurisdiction and authority what authority do you rely upon for your decisions what prevents me from choosing any doctrine i like and saying that papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time this is especially true since councils of bishops have basically stood by the pope it appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is disagreements over what is tradition and tradition and also over authority and discipline my question to the supporters of sspx is this is there any way that your positions with respect to church reforms could change and be conformed to those of the pope assuming that the pope s position does not change and that the leaders of sspx don t jointly make such choice if not this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority if i adopt the view that i m not wrong i can t be wrong and there s no way i ll change my mind you must change yours that i ve either left the catholic church or it has left me the orthodox church does not recognize papal authority jurisdiction viewing authority as present in each bishop and in ecumenical councils we regard the subsequent development of the doctrines regarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of the bishop of rome from the orthodox church without going into the merits of the great schism at least the orthodox agree that a split occurred and don t paly what appear to be semantic games like he s the pope but we don t recognize that what he does is effective words aside it appears to be a de facto split so where are we are we in another arian heresy complete with weak popes or are the sspx priests modern martin luthers well the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what and what the traditional teaching of the church is we sould argue from now until the second coming about what the real traditional teaching of the church is if this were a simple matter east and west would not have been separated for over years many catholics will decide to side with the pope there is some soundness in this because the papacy is infallible so eventually some pope will straighten all this out i thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term i may be wrong here i m not roman catholic what would be the effect of a pope making an ex cathedra statement regarding the sspx situation would it be honored if not how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility again i m not trying to be contentions i m trying to understand since i m orthodox i ve got no real vested interest in the outcome one way or the other schism is a superset of disobedience refusal to obey a legitimate command all schismatics are disobedient but it s a superset so it doesn t work the other way around not all disobeyers are schismatics the mere fact that the sspx priests don t comply with the holy father s desires doesn t make them schismatics it does if the command was legitimate sspx does not view the pope s commands as legitimate why this is a very slippery slope but my problem with this is this according to the traditional theology of holy orders episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction it only confers the power of order the ability to confect the sacraments true enough jurisdiction must be conferred by someone else with the power to confer it such as the pope the society bishops knowing the traditional theology quite well take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone they simply confer those sacraments that require a bishop one could argue that they are establishing a non geographic jurisdiction i don t know if that s even a concept or problem in catholic circles larry overacker llo shell com lawrence overacker shell oil company information center houston tx llo shell com

re sabbath admissions of in article apr athos rutgers edu dlecoint garnet acns fsu edu darius lecointe writes you cannot show from scripture that the weekly sabbath is part of the ceremonial laws before you post a text in reply investigate its context first of all ceremonial law is an extrascriptural term it is sometimes used as a framework to view scripture but if you look at collosions without going into it with the assumption that the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law you will see that it does refer to the sabbath paul writes in collosions how that christ nailed the laws that were against us to his cross and therefore we should not be judged in what what food we eat what we drink the keeping of new moons and holy days or the keeping of the sabbath the word for sabbath in this verse is sabbaton and is used throughout the new testament to refer to the th day if there is any scripture from which we get the idea of the ceremonial law this is one of them and the sabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws if one goes into this with the fundamental assumption the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law then he will have to find some way around it like saying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the th day because the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law but paul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal statement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin in his writings also why is the sabbath absent from the epistles except for hebrews which talks about the rest that comes through faith surely it would have been a big problem for first century christians living in a society that did not rest on the th day especially slaves many new converst were slaves it would have been difficult for slaves to rest on the sabbath if it had been mandatory why is there no mention of this in the epistles link hudson
re atheist s views on christianity was re accepting jeesus in your heart in article apr athos rutgers edu kempmp phoenix oulu fi petri pihko writes jason smith jasons atlastele com wrote the discussion begins why does the universe exist at all one of the laws of nature specifying cause and effect seems to dictate at least to this layman s mind there must be a causal event no reasonable alternative exists i would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime causes precede their effects and i must concede here cause before effect implies time time is part of spacetime hense the argument would be valid i could return and say that this does not infer the cause and effect relationship being unique to this spacetime but i won t because the point is moot doesn t address why which petri pikho addresses below i also concede that i was doubly remiss as i asserted no reasonable alternative exists an entirely subjective statement on my part and one that could be invalidated given time and further discovery by the scientist i also understand that a proving a theory does not necessarily specify that this is how it happened but proposes a likely description of the phenomena in question am i mistaken with this understanding but if you claim that there must be an answer to how did the universe our spacetime emerge from nothing science has some good candidates for an answer all of which require something we christians readily admit to faith the fact that there are several candidates belies that none are conclusive with out conclusive evidence we are left with faith it could even be argued that one of these hypotheses may one day be proven as best as a non repeatable event can be proven but i ask what holds someone today to the belief that any or all of them are correct except by faith a couple of paragraphs deleted summary we ask why does the universe exist i think this question should actually be split into two parts namely why is there existence why anything exists and how did the universe emerge from nothing it is clear science has nothing to say about the first question however is it a meaningful question after all i would say it isn t consider the following apparently it is for many persons hence we have religions the question why anything exists can be countered by demanding answer to a question why there is nothing in nothingness or in non existence actually both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning things that exist do and things that don t exist don t exist tautology at its best carefully examine the original question and then the counter question the first asks why while the second is a request for definition it doesn t address why something does or does not exist but asks to define the lack of existence the second question is unanswerable indeed for how do we identify something as nothing aren t they mutually exclusive terms how do we identify a state of non existence again this is nearing the limits of this simple layman s ability to comprehend and i would appreciate an explanation i might add the worldview of things that exist do and things that don t don t is as grounded in the realm of the non falsifiable as does the theist s belief in god it is based on the assumption that there is not a reason for being something as ultimately un supportable as the position of there being a reason its very foundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there is a reason we come to this either i am therefore i am or i am for a reason if the former is a satisfactory answer then you are done for you are satisfied and need not a doctor if the latter your search is just beginning i seriously doubt god could have an answer to this question time will tell some christians i have talked to have said that actually god is himself the existence however i see several problems with this answer first it inevitably leads to the conclusion that god is actually all existence good and evil devils and angels us and them this is pantheism not christianity agreed it would lead me to question their definition of christianity as well another answer is that god is the source of all existence this sounds much better but i am tempted to ask does god himself exist then if god is the source of his own existence it can only mean that he has in terms of human time always existed but this is not the same as the source of all existence this does not preclude his existence it only seeks to identify his qualities implying he exists to have qualities btw the best answer i have heard is that human reasoning is incapable of understanding such questions being an atheist myself i do not accept such answers since i do not have any other methods like the theist we come to a statement of faith for this position assumes that the evidence at hand is conclusive note i am not arguing against scientific endeavor for science is useful for understanding the universe in which we exist but i differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective i seek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of the creator i also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer why it appears that m pihko agrees as we shall see but because a tool is inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question asserting that why is an invalid question does not provide an answer as far as i can tell the very laws of nature demand a why that isn t true of something outside of nature i e super natural this is not true science is a collection of models telling us how not why something happens i cannot see any good reason why the why questions would be bound only to natural things assuming that the supernatural domain exists if supernatural beings exist it is as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist my apologies i was using why as why did this come to be why did pre existence become existence why did pre spacetime become spacetime but we come to the admission that science fails to answer why because it can t be answered in the realm of modern science does that make the question invalid i don t believe any technology would be able to produce that necessary spark of life despite having all of the parts available just my opinion this opinion is also called vitalism namely that living systems are somehow fundamentally different from inanimate systems do christians in general adopt this position what would happen when scientists announce they have created primitive life say small bacteria in a lab i suppose we would do the same thing as when galileo or capernicus was vindicated before someone starts jumping up and down screaming inquisition note i said vindicated i certainly hope we ve gotten beyond the shooting the messenger stage m pihko does present a good point though we may need to ask what do i as an individual christian base my faith on will it be shaken by the production of evidence that shatters our sacred cows or will we seek to understand if a new discovery truly disagrees with what god said and continues to say in his word why do i ask why apologies to budweiser and company jason jason d smith

re does just justifiable war exist some thoughts a on the non pacifist side killing to defend the innocent may be if anything more justifiable than killing in self defense i can turn my own other cheek but i have no right to turn someone else s it seems to me that if jesus had meant to teach pacifism he would have made his position more explicit he didn t tell the centurion to leave the army for instance and the nt is full of military metaphors b on the pacifist side apparently many early christians refused to fight in the roman army or stated that one should refuse if given a choice but it s not clear whether they were objecting to war per se or objecting to roman policies in modern warfare it seems to be impossible to direct attacks only at combatants bombing both conventional and nuclear kills lots of civilians it s hard to tell whether any particular war is justified at the time often it takes decades for the requisite information to become available to the general public please no email replies this is meant as a contribution to a public discussion and anyone wanting to reply should also reply publicly michael a covington associate research scientist artificial intelligence programs mcovingt ai uga edu the university of georgia phone athens georgia u s a amateur radio n tmi

re question about virgin mary a faris trl oz au aziz faris writes helllo netters i was told the bible says that god took the body of the virgin mary as she was being carried for burial is this true if so were in the bible does it say that regards a faris i think you re talking about the assumption of the blessed virgin mary it says that the immaculate mother of god the ever virgin mary having completed the course of her earthly life was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory this was defined by a papal statement in though it had certainly been believed by some before that like the immaculate conception this is primarily a roman catholic doctrine and like it it has no direct biblical support note that catholics do not believe in sola scriptura that is they do not believe that the bible is the only source of christian knowledge thus the fact that a doctrine has little biblical support is not necessarily significant to them they believe that truth can be passed on through traditions of the church and also that it can be revealed to the church i m not interested in yet another catholic protestant argument but if any catholics can tell us the basis for these beliefs i think it would be appropriate clh again i find myself wanting to respond to a posting and having neither the time nor the proper materials with me you would think i would learn my lesson by now but i m trying to finish writing my thesis and don t have tons of time anyway the basis for our the catholic church s belief in the assumption of mary body and soul into heaven is that to put it simply the apostles and all the early generation christians believed it in fact throughout their ministry the apostles kept in close contact with mary and of the were present when she died only thomas was missing when he arrived several days later he asked to be shown her body and moved with pity peter and several of the other apostles brought him to her tomb when they arrived the seal was still unbroken they broke the seal entered and the body was missing there was no sign that anyone had entered forcibly or otherwise and everything else was laid out exactly as it had been left the apostles present all believed that mary was assumed into heaven and the apostles taught this in their preaching of course this does not appear in any of the texts currently considered part of the bible but it does appear in other writings left behind by several of them basicaly as an apostolic church ie founded by the apostles we believe that the teachings of the apostles whether written down in the bible or written down in other sources is true providing that the authenticity of those other sources can be confirmed at least in the case of the assumption of mary the authenticity is quite clear hope this helps i would welcome anyone who has more information to add to what i ve said mike walker mdw uxa cso uiuc edu univ of illinois

re what was the immaculate conception biblical basis for the immaculate conception i will put enmity between you the serpent and the woman and between your seed and her seed she can also be read he shall crush your head and you shall bruise her or his heel genesis he who commits sin is of the devil john hail full of grace greek kecharitomene the lord is with thee luke from the above we prove the doctrine of the immaculate conception first god has given the proto evangel in genesis which is the first promise of a savior who will redeem mankind from the wiles of satan satan was a murderer from the beginning and has not stood in the truth because there is no truth in him john now the proto evangel promises several things enmity between satan and the woman and enmity between satan and her seed now the woman is both eve who is the immediate point of reference and mary the second eve her seed is jesus christ and he is also at enmity with satan in the same way as mary is said to be at enmity with satan thus knowing as we do that jesus christ is sinless hebrews we can conclude that mary is also sinless because if she wasn t she would not be at enmity with the devil as john tells us and the relation of her sinlessness to christ s sinlessness would be called into question as would god s veracity for god promised an enmity between mary and the serpent and it is not possible for god to lie or be decieved second we have the angelic greeting where mary is called by the archangle gabriel full of grace as i pointed out above this is from the greek word kecharitomene which means not just full of grace but a plenitude or perfection of grace the sense of it is best grasped by the footnote to the jerusalem bible hail you who have been and reamin filled with grace but that is a little to long to say so it is reduced to full of grace and as it says you who have been mary had always been filled with grace from the moment of her conception which was also the moment of her salvation until her death some years later it must be admitted that it is possible that god could have done what the doctrine of the immaclute conception says he did do and if god could keep himself free from any contact with sin through his mother he would have and the bible records this fact to which the fathers of the church such as st john damascus st augustine of hippo st ambrose and others are in complete agreement with as is all of christian tradition and as is the infallible declaration of the pope on the matter in ineffibilus deus andy byler

monophysites and mike walker mike walker if you are using the standard formula of fully god and fully human that i m not sure why you object to saying that jesus was human i think the usual analysis would be that sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity it s a consequence of the fall jesus is human but not a fallen human clh the proper term for what mike expresses is monophysitism this was a heresy that was condemned in the council of chalcedon in ad it grew up in reaction to nestorianism which held that the son and jesus are two different people who happened to be united in the same body temporarily monophysitism is held by the copts of egypt and ethipoia and by the jacobites of syria and the armenian orthodox it believes that jesus christ was god which is correct that he was man which is correct that he was one person which is correct but that he had only one nature and one will and oen energy which is heretical the orthodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and two energies both divine and human though the wills were in perfect harmony that is what mike is trying to get across that while jesus came in human form mike says he did not have a human nature or a human will in reality he had both though neither made him subject to original sin it is interesting to note that the monothelites were a reaction to this conflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures but not two wills or two energies it also was condemned at a late council in constantinople i believe andy byler these issues get mighty subtle when you see people saying different things it s often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously different things or whether they are using different terminology i don t think there s any question that there is a problem with nestorius and i would agree that the saying christ had a human form without a real human nature or will is heretical but i d like to be a bit wary about the copts armenians etc recent discussions suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from orthodoxy as many had thought nestorius was an extreme representative of one of the two major schools of thought more moderate representatives were regarded as orthodox e g theodore of mopsuestia my impression is that the modern monophysite groups inherit the entire tradition not just nestorius version and that some of them may have a sufficient balanced position to be regarded as orthodox clh

re question about virgin mary in article may athos rutgers edu a faris trl oz au aziz faris says a faris posting deleted the moderator replies i think you re talking about the assumption of the blessed virgin mary it says that the immaculate mother of god the ever virgin mary having completed the course of her earthly life was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory this was defined by a papal statement in though it had certainly been believed by some before that like the immaculate conception this is primarily a roman catholic doctrine and like it it has no direct biblical support note that catholics do not believe in sola scriptura that is they do not believe that the bible is the only source of christian knowledge thus the fact that a doctrine has little biblical support is not necessarily significant to them they believe that truth can be passed on through traditions of the church and also that it can be revealed to the church i m not interested in yet another catholic protestant argument but if any catholics can tell us the basis for these beliefs i think it would be appropriate clh that is generally accuate but contains one serious error we catholics do believe that god s revealed truth that is not explicitly recorded in the bible can be and is passed on through the tradition of the church it should be noted that the tradition of the church otherwise known as sacred tradition is not the same as ordinary human traditions however we do not believe that additional truth will be revealed to the church public revelation which is the basis of catholic doctrine ended with the death of st john the last apostle nothing new can be added theologians study this revelation and can draw out implications that were not recognized previously so that the council of nicea could define statements about the theology of the trinity and the incarnation that were not explicitly stated in the bible and had been disputed before the council but there was no new revelation at nicea or at any subsequent council cardinal newman s an essay on the development of christian doctrine written while he was still an anglican is an excellent discussion of of this point it was recently reprinted as a doubleday image books paperback with some related shorter works under the title conscience consensus and the development of doctrine marty helgesen bitnet mnhcc cunyvm internet mnhcc cunyvm cuny edu what if there were no such thing as a hypothetical situation

re athiests and hell in article apr geneva rutgers edu rexlex fnal fnal gov writes in article apr geneva rutgers edu sun gerry palo uunet uu net gerry palo writes note that in this perhaps the oldest of the creeds there is no mention of the danger of hell for non believers likewise there is no mention of the salvation of the believers soul and its destiny in heaven after death there is only the resurrection of the body and it does not say when or how you don t go far enough back if we believe in god and that he did create the heavens and the earth and he did create adam and eve and that they walked in the garden and history flowed from there if we can agree with that then would you agree that the further back you go the closer you get to people who had a stronger memory of who god was and what he said and commanded between adam and eve and golgotha the whole process of the fall of man occurred this involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual world this is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through history the greek for example could say better a beggar in the land of the living than a king in the land of the dead iliad i think the question of what happens to human beings who died before christ is an ever present one with christians i am not ready to conscign adam or abraham or even cain to eternal damnation yet they all died in their sins in the christian sense the same can be said of the whole of gentile humanity and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to him i do not limit the power of christ to save even him through whom satan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment in my studies of the ancient mystery reliegions i have run across many poems or rituals or what nots with the interpretation that those who are of god will be with him via the promised seed but those who rebel will suffer eternal life in dieing it was a standard belief back then it is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment the relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely extended conditions of greenwich mean time it is possible to imagine an eternity of agony or bliss or even many of them in the spiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth it was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous were lost this again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness that fled from us after the fall with our ever increasing involvement with the sense world it would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient people s ideas of life after death today we think we know so much and that if we could go back in time we could sure teach those people a thing or two but i think that as this age has grown older that it is we who opperate from a mist not those of the older ages mankind fell into mist and darkness and at the turning point of time a new light entered into the world the light still grows and we are developing the eyes with which to see by it much new revelation and growth in under standing lies before us our new vision and understanding is still very feeble but it contains something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and much more as well at this point i should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of rudolf steiner founder of anthroposophy for many insights that have led me to my views on this subject i have said it before i d love to post on this but the vulcan hammer would fall the history to purgatory can be shown from the druids in england to the greeks who pilaged it from the egyptians who ultimately got it from the babylonian mysteries and yes the eastern religions also show many similarities i mean its black and white the writings and the archeological finds plainly show its origin and the whys and wherefores of this doctine the way you refer to it as doctrine puts a modern intellectual coloring on it i think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually concrete a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or teachings today can be received i am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to simple dispersion from an original source even if they were passed on the question is to what extent did they reflect real perception and experience the similarity in the midst of great variety of expression of the different people s ideas of the time immediately after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality in any case we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of euclid but by contemplating the principles themselves on the other hand there is one notion firmly embedded in christianity that originated most definitely in a pagan source the idea that the human being consists essentially of soul only and that the soul is created at birth was consciously adopted from aristotle whose ideas dominated christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does today he was at once the father of modern thought and at the same time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our eternal spiritual being had grown dim maybe at sometime in the future indeed i should also clarify that i do not deny that eternal irrevocable damnation is a real possibility but the narrow range in which we conceive of the decisive moment i e after the end of a single earthly life is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the reality and i think that is why the early creeds were couched in terms that did not try to spell it out rex gerry

re the arrogance of christians in article may geneva rutgers edu you wrote the genius of science is that it discovered that enormous progress in knowledge could be made by isolating the study of physical interactions for the more general areas of study and proceeding not by logical argument but by experiment the scientific method is hypothesize attempt to disprove the hypothesis if you fail publish if others fail to disprove your hypothesis accept it as a working theory and move on this method is suitable only for the study of objects without will objects which do not take an interest in the experiment science does not progress via experimentation but by philosophising one aim of experiments is to investigate the validity of the hyptheses resulting from the models produced by this thinking process the arrogance of science is the assumption many advocates of science make that the scientific method is the only method of serious study the only one leading to knowledge rather than belief science has one advantage of all other approaches to explaining the world it is objective its further arrogance is the assumption which arises that since science is the only valid method of thought everything which exists must be the sort of thing which the scientific method can study and that if the scientific method cannot study it it either does not exist or cannot in any way be known anything which affects the physical world can be studied for example since we are part of the physical world anything including spirits which affects our behaviour can be observed science does not make any claims about the existence or non existence of objects which do not affect the physical world since these asumptions about the nature of the world cannot themselves be made the subject of experiment it is bad science to believe them as well as arrogance illogic and just plain sloppy thinking the purpose of science is to produce a model of the physical world the model must be able to explain all past observations and predict the outcome of future observations one of the aims of experiments is to carry out well defined observations which are objective ideally scientist will except the model which best describes the world and the model which realises on the minimal number of assumptions at the moment models which do not rely on the assumption of some spiritual world existing are equally powerful to ones which assume the assumption of a spiritual world as the non spiritual models has fewer assumptions it should be the currently accepted models the scientific process never assumes that its present models are the correct ones whereas many religions claim to represent the truth the arrogance of many theists is that they claim to represent the truth this cannot be said of scientists steve lang slang sling slink slick slack shack shank thank think thick
re question about virgin mary i think you re talking about the assumption of the blessed virgin mary it says that the immaculate mother of god the ever virgin mary having completed the course of her earthly life was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory this was defined by a papal statement in though it had certainly been believed by some before that like the immaculate conception this is primarily a roman catholic doctrine and like it it has no direct biblical support note that catholics do not believe in sola scriptura that is they do not believe that the bible is the only source of christian knowledge thus the fact that a doctrine has little biblical support is not necessarily significant to them they believe that truth can be passed on through traditions of the church and also that it can be revealed to the church i m not interested in yet another catholic protestant argument but if any catholics can tell us the basis for these beliefs i think it would be appropriate clh in the bible there are a lot of instances where god speaks to people where a person just came to know some piece of information where a person walks off into the desert for days etc with all of god s power he certainly can do whatever he wants when he wants it the bible ends with the book of revelations but does god s reign end there no so who can say for sure that god s messages are either no longer happening or still happening i can now hear the clamor for proof with the cold response i ve gotten from the past from this group it s very hard to get the point across i ll only go over the physical stuff so that skeptics can look at documents stored somewhere i ve cited the uncorrupted bodies of saints before they re still there the apparitions at fatima portugal culminated in a miracle specifically granted to show god s existence that was the spinning descending of the sun it was seen in several countries that event is approved by the pope currently images of mary in japan korea yugoslavia philippines africa are showing tears natural or blood these are still under investigation by the church but realize that investigations take decades to finish and if the message is christ will come in ten days that s a bit too late isn t it other events under investigation are inner locutions coming to know stigmata the person exhibits christ s wounds and they don t heal and doctor s don t know why non believers are welcome to pore through documents i m sure this stuff is not like koresh or oral roberts give me m or god will call me home it s free find out why they re happening as we ourselves are studying why if anybody can figure this out tell us you can be of any religion if you have the resources go to one of the countries i mentioned these are not members only events god and mary invites everybody so in conclusion finally we rc s believe in the modern day manifestations of god and mary we are scared to death sometimes although we re told not to there are more proofs and events and that is why not everything is in the bible although in a lot of the apparitions we are told to read the bible as far as the protestant vs catholics issue is concerned in the end god s churches will unite i m not sure how i have some idea but the point is we shouldn t worry about the versus part just do god s work that s all that matters unity will come btw i m just a plain person i m not the pope s spokesperson but i am rc mark ashley disclaimer my opinions not harris marka gcx ssd csd harris com the lost los angelino
re what was the immaculate conception in article may athos rutgers edu todd nickel laurentian ca writes your roommate is correct the immaculate conception refers to the conception of mary in her mother s womb okay now that we ve defined the immaculate conception doctrine would it be possible for those more knowledgeable in the area to give the biblically or other support for it i ve attempted to come to terms with it previously in an attempt to understand it for learning purposes and haven t been able to grasp the reasoning it was a gift from god i think basically the reasoning was that the tradition in the church held that mary was also without sin as was jesus as the tenets of faith developed particularly with augustine sin was more and more equated with sex and thus mary was assumed to be a virgin for life since she never sinned and since she was the spouse of god etc since we also had this notion of original sin ie that man is born with a predisposition to sin and since mary did not have this predisposition because she did not ever sin she didn t have original sin when science discovered the process of conception the next step was to assume that mary was conceived without original sin the immaculate conception mary at that time appeared to a girl named bernadette at lourdes she refered to herself as the immaculate conception since a nine year old would have no way of knowing about the doctrine the apparition was deemed to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine rcs hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources that being sacred scripture and holy tradition in this case mostly tradition joe moore

re what was the immaculate conception note i am cross posting actually emailing this to bit listserv catholic while main posting goes to soc religion christian quotations omitted this is in response to a question about the immaculate conception i explained it but left justification up to our catholic readers clh there is no direct reference in the holy scripture except for the mention of mary s blessedness full of grace in the annunciation by angel gabriel in luke and in the th month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin s name was mary and the angel came unto her and said hail thou that art highly favoured the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women now now hold that line of thought the lord is with mary blessed art thou among women while you read on in the book first lady of the world a popular history of devotion to mary by peter lappin the immaculate conception matter is really far more complicated than the assumption this arose in ad it is quite possible that the feast of mary s conception under the title the conception of saint anne originally commemorated the physical miracle of a woman beyond the age of child bearing conceiving a daughter just as elizabeth had conceived john the baptist a transfer in emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in anne to the miracle of grace wrought by god in the soul of mary was logical mary is the incorruptible timber out of which was hewn the tabernacle of christ s sinless body she is god s eden in whom there is no tree of knowledge and no serpent that harms her perfect beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in christ her purity in that of the father at the time of the council of ephesus she was hailed as innocent without blemish immaculate inviolate spotless holy in soul and body who was blessed as a lily from among thorns unlearned in the evil ways of eve at the end of the thirteenth century an irish franciscan john duns scotus god maintained that it was a greater thing for him to preserve his the son mother from all sin than to use his power to clease her from it later now let s go to the discussion of baptism and original sin from pocket catholic cathechism by john a hardon baptism concupiscence remains after baptism concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized but since it is left to provide trial it has no power to injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of christ jesus manfully resist canon original gifts of adam and eve before their fall in the light of the foregoing we see that our first parents were originally gifted three times over they had the natural gifts of human beings especially the power to think and to choose freely the had the preternatural gifts of bodily immortality and of integrity or the internal power to control desires they had the supernatural gifts of sanctifying grace the virtues of faith hope and charity and the corresponding title to enter heaven by their disobedience they lost the supernatural and preternatural gifts entirely and were weakened without losing their natural capacity to reason and to choose freely baptism restores the supernatural life lost by adam s sin it does not restore the preternatural gifts but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our bodies on the last day going back to immaculate conception i am not sure if this interpretation is in any other books but it may be another contribution to the puzzle given the miracle of st anne bearing a child at a non childbearing age and christ was not yet born and there was no baptism yet on mary s birth but still the angel gabriel s greetings was hail mary full of grace the lord is with you blessed art thou amongst women even mary was confused about this greeting mary could very well have possessed all of the treefold original gifts above given to our first parents adam and eve before their sin hail mary example of praise given by the angel gabriel full of grace natural preternatural supernatural the lord is with you at those times god would definitely want to be with those he has made blessed blessed art thou amongst women that says it all at the conception god made mary full of grace and blessed as the tabernacle for the coming body of christ and so immaculate conception of mary is true and mary still has maintained her immaculate heart marida p s i do hope that others will continue more light and facts on this matter thanks

re christianity and repeated lives in article may athos rutgers edu jek cu nih gov writes gerry palo writes there is nothing in christianity that precludes the idea of repeated lives on earth the apostle paul romans points out that god chose jacob rather than esau to be the ancestor of the covenant people and ultimately of the messiah and that he made this choice while the two boys were still in their mother s womb and therefore could not possibly have done anything good or evil to deserve their appointed destinies if we admit the possibility that they had lived previous lives and that in accordance with the asiatic idea of karma their present lives are a reward or punishment for past behaviour this makes nonsense of paul s whole point the existence of repeated earth lives and destiny karma does not mean that everything that happens is predetermined by past deeds there is an oriental view of it that tends in that direction but i did not subscribe to that view god may choose one individual over another as the fit instrument for his plans but that does not preclude that the development of that individual into what he is in this earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development i do not and rudolf steiner did not subscribe to the oriental view of an inexorable mechanistic karma determining everything that befalls one this is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greater law in the context of which the deed of christ on golgotha and the ultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of christ can be seen as the master theme and indeed a new impulse that was completely free of karma christ incarnated only once in the flesh and in that he had no debt of karma or sin the oriental concepts of reincarnation and karma which are even more trivialized and mechanized in some new age teachings incorrectly assume jesus christ to have been the reincarnation of a master avatar etc their teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the continuing individuality from one life to the next e g buddhism more important they have no concept of the resurrection of the body the ultimate continuity of the whole human being to ultimate resurrection and judgement on the last day there is another biblical passage that also has a bearing it is the tenth chapter of john devoted almost entirely to the man born blind clearly here jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma or that of his parents that led to his blindness but rather that a new impulse is to be revealed through him but note that he does not refute the disciples question in fact they ask it as a matter of course the question being stated as if it were self evident that only one of two possibilities existed it was either the sins of the man himself obviously not in this incarnation or the sins of his parents the fact that they even asked about the first possibility at all indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of christ s answer indicates that he did not disagree with it there is also matthew where jesus says straight out about john the baptist if you care to accept it he himself is elias who was to come this also emphasizes that the gospels do not have a positive teaching either way about reincarnation or in fact about what happens to the human being at all between death and the last day even jesus did not push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it if you care to accept it so i took care to point out not that the bible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either and that much in both scripture and fundamental christian doctrine becomes understandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way i pointedly used repeated earth lives to distinguish a little from the oriental doctrines usually associated with the word reincarnation the phrase is rudolf steiner s wiederholte erdenleben he noted too that the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west completely free from eastern tradition it did in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the most important expression of it being lessing s the education of the human race to return to your original point paul s statement about jacob and esau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma and both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the incarnation death and resurrection ascension and return of jesus christ in my view regards gerry palo compuserve com
re the truth of the bible sodium asc slb com asc slb com michael a montgomery writes i believe that the god has preserved the bible perfectly in that it perfectly conveys all of the truth that he intended this he has done oh yea which version of the bible is the perfectly preserved one and why are there so many translations that are not perfectly preserved is god trying to confuse us minor changes in wording or even accidental omission of passages in some manuscripts does not change the truth being conveyed nor would it lead a serious student into doctrinal error note also that god provided many but that is exactly what happend there are so many branches of denominations of christianity and deviations of doctrine portruding from varying translations of biblical texts by serious students that are much too numerous to begin to count if there is a perfect bible then there would be no possible misinterpretation and there would be no need for anyone here to be debating it on the other hand maybe the bible is perfect but no one on this planet is perfect enough to read it correctly but then there would be no point in god giving us something we cannot use correctly in short if you attack the credibility and reliability of the bible you are on weak ground furthermore the only reason that i can see for wanting to do so is to remove the bible as the final authority and instead put that responsibility on men to sift the bible to strain out the nuggets of truth that it contains in other words what they want to believe and ignore the rest the bible is truth it does not just contain truth imho if you trust your salvation on the reliability of a single book you are on weak ground remember in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god this word existed before the bible was written note word god this word that john is trying to describe cannot be fully described in any written language all languages being imperfect realization comes only from contemplation of the word and is outside the boundaries of language i use the bible as a guide a stepping stone but in no way is it my final authority god alone is the final authority daniel cossack danc procom com compuserve com senior software engineer dupont drive irvine ca procom technology inc

re why do people become atheists undoubtedly people adopt atheism for many reasons but i suspect that a biggie is that the god they ve believed in is in j b phillips s words too small if a person s understanding of god is not allowed to grow and develop it will eventually become inadequate the grey haired gentleman on a throne who was a comforting image in childhood becomes a joke a therapist friend of mine sometimes suggests to her clients that they fire god what she means by that is letting go of an inadequate understanding of god to make room for a fuller one but she follows up by encouraging them to hire a new one my guess is that a lot of folks go through the firing process but are not adequately supported in the subsequent re hire billh

re athiests and hell in article may geneva rutgers edu sun gerry palo uunet uu net gerry palo writes between adam and eve and golgotha the whole process of the fall of man occurred this involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual world this was precisely my point from a theological bent those who lived immediately after the flood such as noah ham his son cush and his son nimrod had a much stronger appreciation of divine wrath they also had a stronger understanding of the true god in fact this immediacy was a cause of hardship for some so much so that atlas who is seen with heavens resting on his shoulders but this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting it is to put god and the strict spirituality of his law at a distance and thus he became the elevator of the heavens this god made men able to feel as if heaven were afar off and as if either the god of heaven could not see through the dark cloud or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of his laws it is interesting to see that it was that was titled emancipator or deliverer or phoroneus it was nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system and abridged the liberties of mankind yet was worship for having given many benefits he was a deliverer all right but not as we think of christ as a deliverer one delivered from a conscious feeling of god s wrath the other actually performed a delivery from gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it as true the question of what happens to human beings who died before christ is an ever present one with christians i am not ready to consign adam or abraham or even cain to eternal damnation i don t see the problem from the time of adam those who looked forward to the coming anointed one and put their faith in the fact that it was god who was to do the provision were accounted as righteous but up to the crucifixion their sins were only covered not taken away therefore the dispensation of the church views the accountability of sin the same but see it as a completed action rom s makes it clear that it has always been salvation via faith and nothing else it is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment the relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely extended conditions of greenwich mean time i understand what you re trying to convey but i don t think i d lay hold of it because the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the eternality of say the church ruling with christ jn tells us what eternal life is exactly as you are correct that it is much more than non cessation of consciousness it was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous were lost it depends upon your def of lost the elect were lost only in time as outside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world existentially we were all born lost but the righteous were in christ and therefore never assuredly lost it would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient people s ideas of life after death maybe this summer i could find time to put together a paper on it i simply have to buy more books for myself and these older books are very expensive either that or countless trips to the oriental museum mankind fell into mist and darkness and at the turning point of time a new light entered into the world the light still grows and we are developing the eyes with which to see by it much new revelation and growth in under standing lies before us our new vision and understanding is still very feeble but it contains something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and much more as well couldn t agree with you more our understanding of say eschatology is clearly clearer than that of say isaiah but that is not what i was referring to at this point i should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of rudolf steiner founder of anthroposophy for many insights that have led me to my views on this subject the way you refer to it as doctrine puts a modern intellectual coloring on it i think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually concrete a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or teachings today can be received no i understand it as you have said this was my point i am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to simple dispersion from an original source even if they were passed on the question is to what extent did they reflect real perception and experience ah this is it this is the big question however i would say again i think that the best lie is one that has an appreciable amount of truth to it look at satan s twist of god s word when he coerced eve that is a very interesting study the similarity in the midst of great variety of expression of the different people s ideas of the time immediately after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality yes that is my point but it is a two edged sword for some do not want the underlying reality to be revealed they were not known as mystery religions for no reason there was the public side of them and there was the private side that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they revealed that private side that is why it is so hard to bring their teachings to light the mystery of iniquity that we find in the bible correlates to this i think the primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately little by little under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath what it would not have been safe to openly profess was the true religion case in point today might be the masons just a note that they too worshipped osiris in egypt who can be traced to nimrod the husband son on the other hand there is one notion firmly embedded in christianity that originated most definitely in a pagan source the idea that the human being consists essentially of soul only and that the soul is created at birth was consciously adopted from aristotle whose ideas dominated christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does today no i disagree with you here gerry i know what you re alluding to in that the church primarily the rcc did endorse aristotelian philosophy into their worldview but i would disagree with you that it originated in greece if you are a student of history you will come to see that much of what greece came to expound to the world as their original was just an adulteration of that which they had taken from conquered countries the soul is clearly mentioned and discussed at length in the egyptian religions as was the unity of god and also the trinity of god see if you can find wilkinson s egyptians he really does a number on what the greeks did to what they pilfered from the egyptians he was at once the father of modern thought and at the same time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our eternal spiritual being had grown dim i m not knocking aristotle or plato or any other greek thinker its just that there is nothing new under the sun indeed i should also clarify that i do not deny that eternal irrevocable damnation is a real possibility but the narrow range in which we conceive of the decisive moment i e after the end of a single earthly life is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the reality and i think that is why the early creeds were couched in terms that did not try to spell it out each age has its own focus of theology the early church struggled with the trinitarian formulation the reformation dealt with authority today eschatology has had much study the early creeds do not spell these things out in detail because they weren t the topic of concern there was insufficient wisdom accumulated they didn t have the exegetical tools that we have today also each age seems to have an air of revelation to it one age has a well tended and cultivated garden in which a particular doctrine is given growth it would be natural for the end of times to have the garden appropriate for the growth of eschatology wouldn t it tangents never ending tangents rex
re monophysites and mike walker hello src readers again the misconception that copts among other oriental orthodox churches believe in monophysitism pops up again we had a discussion about it a while ago in article may geneva rutgers edu db n andrew cmu edu d andrew byler writes the proper term for what mike expresses is monophysitism this was a heresy that was condemned in the council of chalcedon in ad it grew up in reaction to nestorianism which held that the son and jesus are two different people who happened to be united in the same body temporarily monophysitism is held by the copts of egypt and ethipoia and by the jacobites of syria and the armenian orthodox then ofm comments these issues get mighty subtle when you see people saying different things it s often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously different things or whether they are using different terminology i don t think there s any question that there is a problem with nestorius and i would agree that the saying christ had a human form without a real human nature or will is heretical but i d like to be a bit wary about the copts armenians etc recent discussions suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from orthodoxy as many had thought with my appreciation to the moderator i believe that further elaboration is needed this is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue of the copt net newsletter under the authority of the eastern roman empire of constantinople as opposed to the western empire of rome the patriarchs and popes of alexandria played leading roles in christian theology they were invited everywhere to speak about the christian faith st cyril pope of alexandria was the head of the ecumenical council which was held in ephesus in the year a d it was said that the bishops of the church of alexandria did nothing but spend all their time in meetings this leading role however did not fare well when politics started to intermingle with church affairs it all started when the emperor marcianus interfered with matters of faith in the church the response of st dioscorus the pope of alexandria who was later exiled to this interference was clear you have nothing to do with the church these political motives became even more apparent in chalcedon in when the coptic church was unfairly accused of following the teachings of eutyches who believed in monophysitism this doctrine maintains that the lord jesus christ has only one nature the divine not two natures the human as well as the divine the coptic church has never believed in monophysitism the way it was portrayed in the council of chalcedon in that council monophysitism meant believing in one nature copts believe that the lord is perfect in his divinity and he is perfect in his humanity but his divinity and his humanity were united in one nature called the nature of the incarnate word which was reiterated by st cyril of alexandria copts thus believe in two natures human and divine that are united in one without mingling without confusion and without alteration from the declaration of faith at the end of the coptic divine liturgy these two natures did not separate for a moment or the twinkling of an eye also from the declaration of faith at the end of the coptic divine liturgy the coptic church was misunderstood in the th century at the council of chalcedon perhaps the council understood the church correctly but they wanted to exile the church to isolate it and to abolish the egyptian independent pope despite all of this the coptic church has remained very strict and steadfast in its faith whether it was a conspiracy from the western churches to exile the coptic church as a punishment for its refusal to be politically influenced or whether pope dioscurus didn t quite go the extra mile to make the point that copts are not monophysite the coptic church has always felt a mandate to reconcile semantic differences between all christian churches this is aptly expressed by the current th successor of st mark pope shenouda iii to the coptic church faith is more important than anything and others must know that semantics and terminology are of little importance to us throughout this century the coptic church has played an important role in the ecumenical movement the coptic church is one of the founders of the world council of churches it has remained a member of that council since a d the coptic church is a member of the all african council of churches aacc and the middle east council of churches mecc the church plays an important role in the christian movement by conducting dialogues aiming at resolving the theological differences with the catholic greek orthodox presbyterian and evangelical churches as a final note the oriental orthodox and eastren orthodox did sign a common statement of christology in which the heresey of monophysitism was condemned so the coptic orthodox church does not believe in monophysitism peace nabil nabil ayoub engine research center dept of mechanical engineering university of wisconsin madison email ayoub erctitan me wisc edu as i mentioned in a brief apology the comment quoted above from me is confused i appear to say that nestorius was monophysite as andrew byler correctly stated it the nestorians and monophysites were actually opposite parties the point i was making which nabil explains in some detail is that some groups that have been considered heretical probably aren t chalcedon was a compromise between two groups the alexandrians and antiochenes it adopted language that was intended to be acceptable to moderates in both camps while ruling out the extremes i agree that there were extremes that were heretical however in the course of the complex politics of the time it appears that some people got rejected who didn t intend heresy but simply used language that was not understood or even was mispresented and some seem not to have jointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine there are groups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps this posting discussed the descendants of the alexandrians there are also a remaining nestorians like some of the current so called monophysites there is reason to believe that the current so called nestorians are not heretical either they sheltered nestorius from what they saw as unfair treatment but claim they did not adopt his heresies and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of the antiochene tradition clh

public private revelation formerly re question about virgin mary mark ashley s account of private revelation does not as some might think contradict my posting in which i said that the catholic church believes that public revelation on which catholic doctrine is based ended with the death of st john the last apostle in that posting i made sure i used the word public public revelation contains god s truth intended for everyone to believe the revelation contained in the bible is a significant subset of public revelation private revelation is revelation that god gives to an individual he may speak directly to the individual he may send an angel or he may send the virgin mary or some lesser saint the only person who is required to believe a private revelation is the person to whom it is revealed devotional practices may be based on reported private revelations but doctrines can not when an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention the church may investigate it if the investigation indicates a likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from god it will be approved that means that it can be preached in the church however it is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from god a catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved private revelations such as those at fatima and lourdes i suspect that few if any catholics do reject fatima and lourdes but if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not orthodox catholics in good standing i do not have at hand a list of the criteria the church uses in evaluating an alleged private revelation it s not something i need every day but i know that one of the primary requirements is that nothing in the alleged private revelation can contradict anything known through public revelation marty helgesen bitnet mnhcc cunyvm internet mnhcc cunyvm cuny edu what if there were no such thing as a hypothetical situation

re question about virgin mary as the moderator noted i think you mean the assumption catholics believe that the blessed virgin mary went to heaven body and soul at the end of her life this is unusual because the normal course of events is for your body to decay in the grave and stay that way until the resurrection of the dead well it wasn t that way for enoch and elijah both of whom were translated directly into heaven it s beyond my grasp why some object that mary who was far greater than either enoch or elijah should not benefit from the same privelege they recieved she was after all mother of god full of grace and immaculate historically belief in the assumption can be found in the writings of st gregory of tours late th century and in st germain of constantinople and st john of damascus and in st andrew of crete among others and it should be noted that the monophysite chruches of egypt and syria also hold to this belief as part of divine revelation even though they broke away from the unity of the chruch in ad by rejecting the council of chalcedon it might be argued by some protestants that the catholics and orthodox made this belief up but the monophysites put a big hole in that notion as they also hold the belief and they split from the chruch before the belief was first annunciated in writing as far as is known much has been lost from the time of the fathers andy byler

the nicene creed was re major views of the trinity michael bushnell writes the so called creed of athanasius however has always been a western creed and has always had the filioque the orthodox have said that they accept all that it says with the exception of the filioque but it is not in use which is exactly what i pointed out though i was wrong about your use of the creed the catholic encylcopedia in which i read about it said the orthodox do use the creed minus the filioque apparently that has changed the athanasian creed has always had the filioque the nicene constantinopolitan did not of course the orthodox did not delete the filioque from the nicene creed it wasn t there to begin with but they certainly did from the athanasian creed which did have it from the beginning i might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in ways of explaining the generation of the blessed trinity the east emphasizing the idea of the holy spirit proceeding from the father through the son and the west using proceeding from the father and the son in fact some such as tertullian used both formulations see below following therefore the form of these examples i profess that i do call god and his word the father and and his son two for the root and the stem are two things but conjoined the fountain and the river are two kinds but indivisible the sun and the ray are two forms but coherent ones anything which proceeds from another must necessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds but it is not on that account separated from it where there is second however there are two and where ther is third there are three the spirit then is third from god and the son just as the third from the root is the fruit of the stem and third from the fountain is the stream from the river and thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray tertullian against praxeas about ad and i believe that the spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the father through the son tertullian against praxeas about ad and as st thomas showed in his summa theologica part question articles and there is no contradiction between the two methods of generation and in fact the two methods of reckoning the procession emphasize what st augustine among others taught that the holy spirit proceeds from the father and the son but he proceeds from the father in a more preeminent way for whatever the son has he has from the father certainly he has it from the father that the holy spirit proceeds from him for the father alone is not from another for which reason he alone is called unbegotten not indeed in the scriptures but in the practice of theologians and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a matter so great the son however is born of the father and the holy spirit proceeds principally from the father and since the father gives to the son all that he has without any interval of time the holy spirit proceeds jointly from both father and son he would be called son of the father and of the son if which is abhorent to everyone of sound mind they had both begotten him the spirit was not begotten by each however but proceeds from each and both st augustine of hippo the trinity to ad so in a sense all of the formulations are correct to the west at least because the holy spirit proceeds from both father and son but in proceeding from the son the orgin of that procession is the procession from the father so the holy spirit is proceeding from the father through the son but as all that the son has is from the father the holy spirit can be said to proceed from the father without any mention of the son being necessary in any case i am happy to know that i follow in the beliefs of pope st leo i st fulgence of ruspe st cyril of alexandria pope st damsus i st augustine of hippo st epiphanius of salamis st ambrose of milan st hilary of poitiers tertullian and others among the fathers who all have very quotable quotes supporting the catholic position which i enunciated above as for the issue of the adoption of another creed being forbidden i will point out that the holy fathers of ephesus and chalcedon both spoke of the creed of nicea in their statement forbidding anyone to produce write or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by the fathers of nicea that creed is a different creed than that of constantinople which is commonly called the nicene creed not of course in that they were condemning the adoption of the constantinopolitan creed which is but an enlargement upon the creed of nicea but that they were condemning the impious opinions of nestorious who had adopted a radically different creed from the one used by the church which among other things denied the procession of the holy spirit form the son thus the additions of the constantinopolitan creed were not thought to be in violation of this and as the council chalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the holy spirit from the son which nestorius denied they could hardly have been against explaining in a fuller way the creed for they themselves approved of previous additions to it and if the further explanations of the creed made in constantinople were not denigrating of the work done by the holy fathers of nicea or in any way heretical it follows that the council of toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed by the faithful to the creed so as to combat the impieties of the arians in spain because the filioque was not in dispute in the church until many years later under photius and others and that the filioque was not disputed i provide more quotes below since the holy spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to god and he actually proceeds from the father and son it is abundantly clear that he is of the divine essence in it in essence and proceeding from it st cyril of alexandria the treasury of the holy and consubstantial trinity thesis ad the holy spirit is not of the father only or of the son only but he is the spirit of the father and the son for it is written if anyone loves the world the spirit of the father is not in him and again it is written if anyone however does not have the spirit of christ he is none of his when the father and the son are named in this way the holy spirit is understood of whom the son himself says in the gospel that the holy spirit proceeds from the father and that he shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you pope st damasus i the decree of damasus ad the only begotten holy spirit has neither the name of the son nor the appelation of father but is called holy spirit and is not foreign to the father for the only begotten himself calls him the spirit of the father and says of him the he proceeds from the father and will receive of mine so that he is reckoned as not being foreign to the son but is of their same substance of the same godhead he is spirit divine of god and he is god for he is spirit of god spirit of the father and spirit of the son not by some kind of synthesis like soul and body in us but in the midst of father and son of the father and of the son a third by appelation the father always existed and the son always existed and the spirit breathes from the father and the son and neither is the son created nor is the spirit created st epiphanius of salamis which is on cyprus the man well anchored and ad concerning the holy spirit i ought not to remain silent nor yet is it necessary to speak still on account of those who do not know him it is not possible for me to be silent however it is necessary to speak of him who must be acknowledged who is from the father and the son his sources st hilary of poitiers the trintiy to ad thus as i have pointed out before gaul spain italy africa egypt palastine and the lands of the greeks all of christnedom at that time all have fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine expressed by the filioque i suggest to those of the orthodox church that they come up with some of the fathers besides st john of damascus who all will admit denied the filioque to support their views it is not enough to bring up the proceeds from the father line of the creed or the gospel of john for that says what we believe also but it does not say the holy spirit does not proceed from the son only that he does proceed from the father andy

re good jewish arguments kwfinken pooh harpo uccs edu kevin w finkenbinder wrote scott born phys virginia edu wrote intro deleted jesus wasn t really descended from david as the messiah was supposed to have been joseph was but christians say that joseph wasn t related to jesus truthfully if you look at the geneology of christ in luke and the one in matthew you will notice that they trace different lines back to david i have been told that one traces mary s line back to david and the other traces joseph s line back to david both of them go beyond david in history acording to some of my jewish friends jewishness is passed to a child by the mother and the legal rights of jewishness are passed through the father if it is true that one of these geneologies is mary s then christ s bloodline is from david through his mother this also means that christ had all of the legal rights of a decendant of david as according to at least roman law and possibly mosaic law as well but i am not sure joseph was christ s legal father the argument for luke s genealogy being that of mary is very weak according to luke and when he began his ministry jesus himself was about thirty years of age being supposedly the son of joseph the son of eli aside from the fact that mary is not mentioned there are two possible interpretations either joseph was her father or he was her brother clearly this is not acceptable a third would be that joseph the son of eli was her father and just happened to have the name as the man to whom she was betrothed but that would seem to be grasping at straws the most straightforward interpretation is that luke had no intention of tracing mary s genealogy in which case he would have named her but that he traces her husband s from david s son nathan the matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from david s son solomon to joseph matthew reads and to jacob was born joseph the husband of mary by whom was born jesus who is called christ there are two apparent problems the first is how to reconcile the two paternal genealogies which diverge with the sons of david solomon and nathan the second is why is any genealogy of joseph relavent at all if joseph had nothing to do with it if joseph was not jesus s physical father then the original poster is quite correct that claims for jesus s messianic heritage are not based on truth but only on appearances whatever jesus s divine nature was the second problem is easy in my mind we assume that joseph was not involved in the conception of jesus in any way however a holy spirit capable of working a physical conception in mary is also capable of employing the physical agency of joseph s seed in this work in our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss solely in terms of a physical act whereas it is really a matter of purity on a much higher level as well the important thing is that neither mary nor joseph was conscious of any union between them they had not known each other thus the first gospel s dedication of half its opening chapter to the genealogy of joseph is quite relevant to jesus the virgin birth not withstanding to the first question there is an answer that creates to begin with more problems than it resolves it is that the two evangelists are relating the births of two entirely different children of two entirely different sets of parents except for the names of the parents and the child and the birthplace in bethlehem there is no point in common between the two stories matthew and luke converge in their accounts only thirty years later with the baptism of jesus in jordan rudolf steiner offered his explanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge with their accounts of the one jesus of nazareth he did not derive his resolution from biblical study or speculation or from other external documents and the discussion of how this could be might bring us beyond the limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup in any case the details are described in steiner s the spiritual guidance of the human being and of humanity the gospel of st luke and the gospel of st matthew whether or not rudolf steiner s methods and explanation are accepted as valid at least this interpretation resolves the apparent contradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact as for the passing of one s jewishness through the mother this was never an issue with jesus no one ever questioned his or mary s jewishness the issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal line of descent from david the king gerry palo compuserve com

re mormon temples mserv mozart cc iup edu mail server writes one thing i don t understand is why being sacred should make the temple rituals secret on of the attributes of being sacred in this case is that they should not be spoken of in a common manner or trampled under feet such as the lords name is today the ceremonies are performed in the temple because the temple has been set aside as being as sacred holy uncommon place we believe that the ceremonies can only be interpreted correctly when they are viewed with the right spirit which in this case is in the temple so from our point of view when they are brought out into the public they are being trampled under feet because of misinterpretations and mocking and it is therefore offensive to us please do not assume that because of my use of the words we and our that i m an official spokesman for the lds church i am merely stating what i believe is the general feeling among us others feel free to disagree steve ward saw bcstec ca boeing com
re what was the immaculate conception maxwell c muir writes just a quick question if mary was immaculately concieved so she could be a pure vessel does this mean that she was without sin and therefore the perfect meaning sinless female human being is this why she is held so highly in the catholic church despite it s basically patriarchical structure she was immaculately conceived and so never subject to original sin but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life this was possible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by god she is regarded so highly because of her special relationship to god and everything that flows from that relationship the catholic church sees her as the new eve the fathers in the early church use this particular figure a lot eve is the mother of all the living in a genetic sense mary is the mother of all the living in the order of grace as sin came through eve so grace jesus christ came through mary

re serbian genocide work of god note i am not the original poster i am just answering because i think this is important in article may athos rutgers edu db n andrew cmu edu d andrew byler writes revdak netcom com writes evil result of human sinfulness rather than the will of god in a certain sense yes but in the sense that god allows evil to happen when obviously he being god he could have not had it happen does in a certain sense mean that he wills it to happen god does not condone evil but instead uses it for good as you say however what god desires must be seperated from what actually happens for example god desires that all should be saved timothy however it is quite obvious that nowhere near all are saved was god s will thwarted no because his will cannot be escaped for even when it appears that it is your will doing something it is actually the will of god which by his grace has disposed us to do as he wishes so we come to the age old question why does evil occur to which we must answer that god allows evil to occur though he does not condone it so that his ultimate plan may be brought to sucess personally i suggest reading the parts of the summa theologica of st thomas that deal with the knowledge of god to get a good grasp on this whole idea whoo i m going to have to be very careful with my language here i think god is voluntarily giving up his omniscience in this world so that we can decide on our own where we go free will in this sense god allows evil to occur and in this sense can be held responsible as my chaplain says however his will is of course that all be saved he s not going to save us by himself we have to take a step in his direction before he will save us read that last sentence carefully i m not saying we save ourselves i m saying we have to accept our salvation i do not believe in predestination it would appear from what you say further down that you do stuff deleted i am not saying that anyone deserves punishment more than someone else i am simply pointing out that god could be using the serbians and croatians as instruments of his punishment as he did with the israelites against the cannanites ok i have trouble with that but i guess that s one of those things that can t be resolved by argument i accept your interpretation more deleted the issue is not questioning why god has made the world in the way god so chooses it is whether i am discerning the world in the way god intends it the debate is about whether we should not oppose the serbians in their ethnic cleansing because they might be doing the will of god and i said christians should not be participants in such wars and slaughters that does not mitigate the fact that god allows this evil to continue for he is patient and willing that none should perish so he waits for those whom he has foreknown to turn to him from their evil this is what indicates to me that you may believe in predestination am i correct i do not believe in predestination i believe we all choose whether or not we will accept god s gift of salvation to us again fundamental difference which can t really be resolved yet more deleted i am not saying that the evil befalling the bosnians is justified by their guilt i am saying that it is possible that god is punishing them in this way in no way is this evil justified bu that does not mean that god cannot use evil to further his purposes i am not accusing the bosnians though they may very well be guilty of great sins but that is up to god to judge we are all defendants when the time comes for our judgement by god let us all sincerely hope and pray that we will have jesus christ as our advocate at that judgement yes it is up to god to judge but he will only mete out that punishment at the last judgement as for now evil can be done by human beings that is not god s will and the best we can do is see taht some good comes out of it somehow the thing that most worries me about the it is the will of god argument is that this will convince people that we should not stop the rape and killing when i think that it is most christ like to do just that if jesus stopped the stoning of an adulterous woman perhaps this is not a good parallel but i m going to go with it anyway why should we not stop the murder and violation of people who may or may not be more innocent andy byler vera i am your clock i bind unto myself today vera noyes i am your religion the strong name of the noye midway uchicago edu i own you trinity no disclaimer what lard st patrick s breastplate is there to disclaim

mormon temples mserv mozart cc iup edu mail server writes one thing i don t understand is why being sacred should make the temple rituals secret the so sacred it s secret explanation is a bit misleading while there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment there is no injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public but since public discussion is often irreverent most mormons would rather keep silent than have a cherished practice maligned but there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the ceremony itself granted the gnostic christians had their secret rituals but these seem to have been taken entirely from pagan pre christian mystery religions there are other interpretations to christian history in this matter one must recall that most of what we know about the gnostics was written by their enemies eusebius claims that jesus imparted secret information to peter james and john after his resurrection and that those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the twelve eusebius historia ecclesiastica ii irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and bishops against heresies iv but eusebius disagrees he claims the secret ceremonies of the christian church perished with the apostles interestingly enough eusebius refers to the groups which we today call gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis eusebius op cit iii his gripe was not that thay professed a gnosis but that they had the wrong one writings dealing with jesus post resurrection teachings emphasize secrecy not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching certain things indiscriminately in one story simon magus opens a dialog with peter on the nature of god peter s response is you seem to me not to know what a father and a god is but i could tell you both whence souls are and when and how they were made but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you clementine recognitions ii if any one theme underlies the recognitions it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught but can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways i don t intend that everyone interpret christian history as i do but i believe that evidence exists favorably interpreted of course of early christian rites analogous to those practiced by mormons today neither new testament christianity nor biblical judaism made a secret of their practices but if judaism and christianity had such ceremonies would you expect to read about them in public documents one can search the book of mormon and other mormon scripture and find almost no information on temple worship yes you could establish that mormons worship in temples but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that worship on that basis can we conclude that the bible explains all practices which might have taken place and that absence of such descriptions proves they did not exist mormon scholar dr hugh nibley offers us a list of scriptures from which i have taken a few it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given matt all men cannot receive this saying save they to whom it is given matt i have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now john the time cometh when i shall no more speak unto you in proverbs but i shall shew you plainly of the father john unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter cor many things i would not write with paper and ink but i come unto you and speak face to face jn nibley since cumorah pp again these can also be interpreted many different ways i believe they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught were actually taught openly i have heard that joseph smith took the entire practice i e both the ritual and the secrecy surrounding the ritual from the freemasons anybody in the know have any authoritative information on whether or not this claim is true historically joseph smith had been adiministering the temple endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the freemasons there is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not change after smith became a mason it can be argued that smith had ample exposure to masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his time and through his brother hyrum a mason though no specific connection has yet been established my conversations with masons with respect to temple rite transcriptions which have appeared on the net have led me to believe that the connection from masonry to mormonism is fairly tenuous as our moderator notes most of what was similar was removed in the recent revisions to the temple ceremony i believe that critics who charge that mormon rites were lifted from freemasonry do not have adequate knowledge of the rites in question jay windley

re the doctrine of original sin nothing unclean shall enter heaven rev therefore babies are born in such a state that should they die they are cuf off from god and put in hell which is exactly the doctrine of st augustine and st thomas of coures having only original sins on thier souls they suffer the lightest punishment the loss of the vision oand presence of god but that does not change the undeniable fact that they cannot possibly come to a forgivenss of original sin nor can they inherit eternal life that as st augustine said is what the pelagian heretics taught which is why he said later if you want to be a christian do not teach that unbaptized infants can come to a forgivenss of original sin doesn t the bible say that god is a fair god if this is true how can this possibly be fair to the infants

re portland earthquake archau saturn wwc edu austin c archer writes i am interested in views about the non event of may seriously how can a christian discriminate between messages from god which are to be taken seriously and those which are spurious is there a useful heuristic which would help us avoid embracing messages which by their non fulfillment are proven to be false thus causing the name of christ to be placed in disrepute is this a problem at all i believe that a careful understanding of scripture can help us here it seems to me that anytime we are proven by events to be mistaken it points to a serious failure in understanding god s will it should result in a reevaluation of what we accept as truth i must hasten to add that i was always skeptical even cynical about these prophesies as i tend to be concerning all such but clearly many christians put much stock in them if the church represents christ in the world then christians must avoid being made the laughing stock of the world lest we dishonor him further the more often we cry wolf the less seriously we tend to be taken any comments good point it is very true that these false predictions are dangerous we are warned more than once in scripture about false prophtets however as is often the case with other issues one cannot let those who falsly report such visions as a reason against believing in any of them i did not get the impression you were asserting this by the way i consider my response not so much a response to your posting but a response to the topic as a whole example the appearances of mary at fatima portugal in among other things she predicted the conversion of russia to atheism something that happened less than a year later w the bolshevik revolution she also predicted the second world war that is predicte predicted that it would occur during the papacy of a certain pope who was not the current one it happened just like she said she warned there would be fire in the sky as a warning that the second world war was about to start about a week before germany invaded weathermen and women i suppose all over europe from england to spain to eastern europe reported the most spectacular reddish color in the sky ever recorded to this day some try to explain it off as the northern lights and the relation to mary s prediction simply coincidence you all can decide for yourselves mary predicted that the atheistic russia would spread her evils all over the world and persecute religion she said many other things as well too numerous to list here every single one has been realized one can only use the term coincidence so many times in the same explanation before its use becomes ridiculous so yes there are many false prophets and many false reports there are true ones too we must always remain open to that fatima was one example there is another one currently occuring the apparitions that have been taking place at medjurgorje yugoslavia or whatever its called now mary has been appearing every day for eleven years now it s time the world started listening more info available to any who want it peace in christ our lord mike walker mdw uxa cso uiuc edu

re christianity and repeated lives there is nothing in christianity that precludes the idea of repeated lives on earth there is a paragraph in the new testament which in my opinion clearly makes a positive inference to reincarnation i don t remember which one it is off of the top of my head but it basically goes like this jesus is talking with the apostles and they ask him why the pharisees say that before the messiah can come elijah must first come jesus replies that elijah has come but they did not recognize him it then says that the apostles perceived that he was refering to john the baptist this seems to me to clearly imply reincarnation can anyone offer a reasonable alternative interpretation i would be very interested to hear it

re why do people become atheists in article may athos rutgers edu mayne nu cs fsu edu writes in article may athos rutgers edu fil sapienza med umich edu fil sapienza writes why are atheists atheists believes it could be the result of brokenness this is condescending at best and a slightly disquised ad hominem attack this attitude on the part of many theists especially the vocal ones is one reason for the hostility you sense how do you like it when atheists say that people turn to religion out of immature emotionalism i agree if you are going to find out anything from people who don t share your beliefs do not attack them or condescend to them and hope to get a neutral picture of them come to them with an open mind i don t believe that atheists are generally any more broken than anybody else any cause and effect is likely to be the other way there is an emotional price to pay for being different hearing one s beliefs or lack thereof condemned and one s motives and character attacked well you do believe in something as i see it even if it is a sort of anti belief no negative connotation meant i mean simply that you believe that god does not exist christians can also feel that sense of difference however when they are associated with those weird televangelists who always talk about satan if you ll excuse the cliched sound of this everyone has to deal with his her differences from other people i can understand how being an atheist could be hard for you being a christian is sometimes hard for me i became an atheist when i got old enough to reason because there was just no good reason to believe the religion i had been taught this was very painful because of the pressure i was placed under by my family and friends i wanted to fit in believe and be accepted i tried but finally the cognitive dissonance was just too great you should not have to repress how you feel you should be able to discuss it without fear i think there are admirable things to learn from any belief which can enrich your own by asking myself the questions that atheists may ask me i can learn the answers and become stronger in my faith if my faith can t support knowing the answers to those questions it is weak and untrue i have sympathy for gays growing up in repressive environments and having to hide and sometimes at first try to deny a part of themselves because i ve been there only in my case it was my rationality instead of sexuality which i was forced to try to repress in some way the pressures were different of course because you chose your beliefs or are you saying that they were not your choice but born of necessity please no flames about whether or not gay people choose their lifestyle that s elsewhere in this newsgroup i must say that i wasn t hurt by my experiences in church any more than some of my friends who didn t become atheists i was just hurt differently i m not sure i understand this sentence could you explain moderator points out that many most atheists aren t hostile they just cease believiing in xiantiy religion true consider also that people like pat robertson and many of the christian extremists in soc religion christianity naturally evoke hostility by their attacks on anyone who disagrees and their attempts to force their views on others you are known by the company you keep christians trying to preach in alt atheism should not be surprised by hostility ouch yes part of being a christian is accepting everyone with an open heart including people of our own camp with whom we completely disagree by the same token i believe that accusation and suspicion are not the best way to reach out to those not of our faith nor is it effective to try to browbeat people into accepting our religion i have a different idea of mission be what i am a christian who is happy in her faith and if others see that and want to know about either the happiness or the religion i ll share what i know without pressure and let them make their own decisions at some point you just have to agree to disagree acceptance of diversity not uniformity is the way to sow peace bill mayne vera noyes i am your clock i bind unto myself today vera noyes i am your religion the strong name of the noye midway uchicago edu i own you trinity no disclaimer what lard st patrick s breastplate is there to disclaim

re monophysites and mike walker in article may geneva rutgers edu db n andrew cmu edu d andrew byler writes mike walker if you are using the standard formula of fully god and fully human that i m not sure why you object to saying that jesus was human i think the usual analysis would be that sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity it s a consequence of the fall jesus is human but not a fallen human clh i differ with our moderator on this i thought the whole idea of god coming down to earth to live as one of us subject to sin and death as one of the consecration prayers in the book of common prayer puts it was that jesus was tempted but did not succumb if sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity then jesus fully human nicea would not be subject to sin but then the resurrection loses some of its meaning because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin to distinguish between human and fallen human makes jesus less like one of us at the time we need him most these issues get mighty subtle when you see people saying different things it s often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously different things or whether they are using different terminology i don t think there s any question that there is a problem with nestorius and i would agree that the saying christ had a human form without a real human nature or will is heretical but i d like to be a bit wary about the copts armenians etc recent discussions suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from orthodoxy as many had thought nestorius was an extreme representative of one of the two major schools of thought more moderate representatives were regarded as orthodox e g theodore of mopsuestia my impression is that the modern monophysite groups inherit the entire tradition not just nestorius version and that some of them may have a sufficient balanced position to be regarded as orthodox clh first the monophysites inherited none of nestorius s version they were on the opposite end of the spectrum from him second the historical record suggests that the positions attributed to nestorius were not as extreme as his successful opponents who wrote the conventional history claimed mainly nestorius opposed the term theotokos for mary arguing i think correctly that a human could not be called mother of god i mean in the athanasian creed we talk about the son uncreate surely even arians would concede that jesus existed long before mary anyway nestorius s opponents claimed that by saying mary was not theotokos that he claimed that she only gave birth to the human nature of jesus which would require two seperate and distinct natures the argument fails though because mary simply gave birth to jesus who preexisted her either divinely if you accept nestorianism as commonly defined or both natures intertwined a la chalcedon second i am not sure that nestorianism is not a better alternative than the orthodox view after all i find it hard to believe that pre incarnation that jesus s human nature was in heaven likewise post ascension i think rather that god came to earth and took our nature upon him it was a seperate nature capable of being tempted as in gethsemane since i believe the divine nature could never be tempted but in its moments of weakness the divine nature prevailed comments on the above warmly appreciated jason albert there may be differences in what we mean by subject to sin the original complaint was from someone who didn t see how we could call jesus fully human because he didn t sin i completely agree that jesus was subject to temptation i simply object to the idea that by not succumbing he is thereby not fully human i believe that you do not have to sin in order to be human i again apologize for confusing nestorianism and monophysitism i agree with you and have said elsewhere that there s reason to think that not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in fact heretical there are scholars who maintain that nestorius was not nestorian i have to confess that the first time i read some of the correspondence between nestorius and his opponents i thought he got the better of them however most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to chalcedon was an advance and that nestorius was at the very least rash and dogmatic as the editor of the christological controversy refers to him in rejecting all approaches other than his own as regular usenet readers know narrowness can be just as much an impediment as being wrong furthermore he did say some things that i think are problematical he responds to a rather mild letter from cyril with a flame worthy of usenet in it he says to attribute also to the logos in the name of the incarnation the characteristics of the flesh that has been conjoined with him is my brother either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the greeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of arius and apollinaris and the others those who are thus carried away with the idea of this association are bound because of it to make the divine logos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some degree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his fearfulness these things are taken falsely when they are put off on the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us who perpetrate the falsehood it s all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between humanity and divinity but the whole concept of incarnation is based on exactly the idea that the divine logos does in fact have to some degree a part in being born growing up and dying of course it must be understood that there s a certain indirectness in the logos participation in these things but there must be some sort of identification between the divine and human or we don t have an incarnation at all nestorius seemed to think in black and white terms and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this area you say i find it hard to believe that pre incarnation that jesus s human nature was in heaven i don t think that s required by orthodox doctrine it s the divine logos that is eternal clh

satan and mtv somewhere someone told me that satan was the angel in charge of music in heaven and on top of that he was the most beautiful of the angels isn t it funny that these days how mtv has become the bible of music and beauty these days mtv controls what bands are popular no matter how bad they are in fact it is better to be politically correct like u madonna than to have any musical talent then of course you have this television station that tells us all how to dress think about it who started the retro fashion craze mtv and madonna gag anyway just food for thought it is really my own wierd theory if revelation was to come true today i think mtv would the ever changing waters music and fashion world that the beast would arise from and madonna will be the whore of babylon riding the beast and drinking the blood of the martyrs hmmmm great idea for a book movie steven c salaris we re a lot more dangerous than live crew salaris carcs wustl edu and their stupid use of foul language because we have ideas we have a philosophy geoff tate queensryche
re satanic tounges in article may athos rutgers edu koberg spot colorado edu allen koberg writes there is dis crepancy even among charismatic organizations as to the proper use of tongues be it revelatory with interpretation for prayer use or for signifying believers which i doubt since any one can do it pentecostals assembly of god church of christ seem to espouse all three neo pentecostals tend to view prayer use and as a sign as the uses speaking in tongues during a service is not usually done by neo pentecostals because for the most part they still attend protestant churches non denominational churches seem to view the use as a sign as merely optional but recommended koberg just a couple of minor corrections here the churches of christ do not usually believe in speaking in tongues in fact many of them are known for being strongly opposed to pentecostal teaching you are probably thinking of church of god in christ the largest african american pentecostal denomination i m not sure what you mean by signifying believers but it should be pointed out that the assemblies of god does not now nor has it ever held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a christian the doctrine that traditional pentecostals including the a g maintain is that speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming a christian in which one is baptized in the holy spirit that may be what you were referring to but i point this out because pentecostals are frequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order to be a christian such a position is only held by some groups and not the majority of pentecostals many pentecostals will quote the passage in mark about these signs following them that believe but they generally do not interpret this as meaning if you don t pactice the signs you aren t saved i know it s hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that has such diversity but i think you ve made some pretty big generalizations here do neo pentecostals only believe in tongues as a sign and tongues as prayer but not tongues as revelatory with a message i ve never heard of that before in fact i would have characterized them as believing the same as pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as a sign of spirit baptism also while neo pentecostals may not be inclined to speak in tongues in the non pentecostal churches they attend they do have their own meetings and in many cases a whole church will be charismatic ken banner dept of religious studies university of pennsylvania kbanner philae sas upenn edu
re major views of the trinity ann jackson ajackson cs ubc ca wrote on may in article may geneva rutgers edu jim green writes can t someone describe someone s trinity in simple declarative sentences with words that have common meaning the answer to this question appears to be no i would like to submit the following which helped me enormously if it has already been posted i apologize it seems that during the middle ages it was customary for pastors to explain the trinity to their parishoners by analogy to water water is water but can exist in three forms liquid ice and vapor thus it is possible for one essence to exist in three forms and recently the pastor of my church drew an analogy which i also found useful a woman is often percieved by others in three ways depending on their relationship to her a mother a wife and an employee in a business thus it seems clear to me that the essence of god can subsist in the father son and holy spirit or depending on one s particular need for him carol bocher
re homosexuality issues in christiani any one who thinks that homosexuality and christianity are compatible should ck out romans i corinthians i timothy jude ii peter gen lev to name a few of the verses that pertain to homosexuality in christ s love bryan whitsell i was waiting for this i think your question should be rephrased the many verses of the bible which condem homosexuality by our beliefs have been shoved down the throats of homosexuals for a long time by well meaning christians the question is how do they interpret these verses any discussion of any issue this or any other issue requires a proof of your case as well as a disproof of the opposing view we are already familiar with those verses and many have proven to themselves that these condem homosexual behaviour we must now establish reasons for not believing this to be true based on the interpretation of these scriptures given by someone who has come to grips with them todd

mary s assumption a few points about mary s being taken into heaven at the end of her life on earth one piece of evidence for mary s assumption into heaven is the fact that no christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was buried some christian churches claimed to be located at the final resting places of peter mark and other saints but no one ever claimed to possess the body of mary the greatest of the saints why because everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven although there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of mary some passages seem suggestive like the passage in revelation that describes a woman giving birth to a son and later being crowned in the heavens of course the woman in this passage has other interpretations she can also be taken a symbol for the church the assumption of mary makes sense because of her relationship to christ jesus perfect god and perfect man fulfilled the requirements of the law perfectly under the law god gave to us we are to honor our mother and father and christ s act of taking his mother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law also he took his flesh from her so it seems appropriate that he decide not to allow her flesh to rot in the grave one last point an ex catholic attempted to explain catholic doctrine on the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that mary did not die this is not a correct summary of what catholics believe the dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying whether mary did or did not die in fact the consensus among catholic theologians seems to be that mary in fact did die this would make sense christ died and his mother who waited at the foot of the cross would want to share in his death brian finnerty
should christians fight justifiable war i posted this a couple of weeks ago and it doesn t seem to have appeared on the newsgroup and i haven t had a reply from the moderator we were having intermittent problems with our mail at the time please excuse me if you have seen this before should christians fight last week alastair posted some questions about fighting and whether there are such things as justifiable wars i have started looking into these things and have jotted down my findings as i go i haven t answered all his questions yet and i know what i have here is on a slightly different tack but possibly i ll be able to get into it more deeply later and post some more info soon our duty to our neighbour do good to all men gal love our neighbour as ourselves matt act the part of the good samaritan luke toward any who may be in trouble we will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured man and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes people harm even medical corps of the army etc christians are by faith citizens of the commonwealth of israel ephesians and also recognise that god rules in the kingdoms of men and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles of those nations which we are not part of due to our faith we are to be strangers and pilgrims amongst the nations so we are just passing through and not part of any nation or any national aspirations this can also be applied to politics etc but that s another story we are not supposed to strive or resist evil even suffer yourselves to be defrauded it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in preserving a state which christ will destroy when he returns to set up god s kingdom our duty to the state render therefore unto caesar the things which be caesar s and unto god the things which be god s luke let every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of god whosoever resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god rom submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lord s sake whether it be to king as supreme for so is the will of god that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men pet these scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a divine command but it is equally clear from acts that when any ordinance of man runs counter to god s law we must refuse submission to it the reason for this is that we are god s bond servants and his service is our life s task an example of the type of thing is in col where bondservants were to work heartily as unto the lord so also we should work as if our boss was god i e pressed down shaken together and running over oops a bit of a side track there in the contests between the nations we are on god s side a side that is not fighting in the battle but is testifying to the truth when we believe in god and embrace his promises we become fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are no longer interested in associations of the world think of this in relation to unions etc as well paul tells us to lay aside every weight that we may run the race that is set before us and if we are wise we will discard any association which would retard our progress thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier tim one of these entanglements he warns about is be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers one of the obvious applications of this is marriage with unbelievers but it also covers things like business partnerships and any other position where we may form a close association with any person or persons not believing the truth about god in this case the army the principle comes from deut remember that as well as them being different animals of different strengths one was clean and one unclean under the law these ideas are strongly stressed in cor i suggest you read this the yoking also has another aspect that of servitude and jesus says take my yoke upon you so we are then yoked with christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers we have already seen that we are bondservants of christ and paul says become not ye the bondservants of men cor rv an example from the old testament the question is asked in chr shouldest thou help the ungodly the situation here is a good example of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers jehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life here are the facts he had made an affinity with ahab who had sold himself to work wickedness before the lord kings when asked by ahab to form a military alliance he had agreed and said i am as thou art my people as thy people kings an unequal yoking he sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted on hearing the prophet of the lord trying to do the right thing he found that he was yoked and therefore couldn t break away from the evil association he had made god says to us come out from among them and be ye separate and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and ye shall be my sons and daughters cor this is more or less what i have found out so far i m still looking into it as i don t think i ve answered all the questions raised by alastair yet heres a summary and a few things to think about the christian in under command obedience to this command is an essential factor in his relationship with christ john total dedication to this course of action is required romans disobedience compromises the close relationship between christ and his followers pet we are to be separated to god rom this involves a master servant relationship rom no man can serve two masters matt all that is in the kosmos is lust and pride quite opposed to gos john christs kingdom is not of this world i e not worldly in nature if it was his servants would fight to deliver him if christ is our master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom was not of this world then his servants cannot possibly fight for another master strangers and pilgrims have no rights and we cannot swear allegiance to anyone but god the servant of the lord must not war but be gentle to all tim this does not just apply to war but also to avoiding strife throughout our lives there is a war to be waged not with man s weapons cor but with god s armour eph i ll probably post some more when i ve had time to look into things a bit further gideon king phone

divorce i deleted much of the following article in order to discuss the specific issue of whether it is acceptable to divorce in article may athos rutgers edu crs carson u washington edu cliff slaughterbeck writes along the way she was married happily to a wonderful and supportive husband and gave birth to two sons still everything was not perfect for jane since she could never open up the deepest part of her soul to her husband she always found that she could be much closer to her women friends than to her husband as good and loing as a husband as he might be she struggled very much with this until at the age of she decided that she was a lesbian when she came home to announce this understanding of herself her husband told her that he had come to the same understanding several years before and was waiting for her to come to that realization in her own time her children ages and at the time were also extremely supportive of her as the youngest put it that just means that you love people very much jane and her husband agreed to divorce but remain friends and still consider each other as part of the extended family to this day one of the interesting things that jane said in this whole discussion was homosexuality is not about what goes on in the bedroom she found that she was much more able to have a deep committed relationship with a woman than a man sex in her mind is only a part of the whole relationship the key thing is how one interconnects with other people she made a specific point to say that it was not that she had never met a good man since she was married to a wonderful man for a dozen years take a few seconds and honestly ponder that thought and it s implications i have thought about the implications and it is scary we have a whole generation of families broken up because some men have decided that is is okay to leave their wives and children for the thrill of a younger more attractive woman if we accept that it is legitimate for jane to have divorced how can we not accept anyone s decision to divorce because he has found someone with whom he can have a more deep committed relationship marriage is not a state of being it is a mutual journey in life love is not a passive feeling it must be actively willed is it acceptable for an older executive to dump his wife of many years who stayed home to care for the children because he can t be happy sexually unless he is with a beautiful young blonde the real solution for both in the couple to make a renewed effort hold fast to the faith has not the lord repeatedly compared his relation to his people as a faithful and enduring husband we learn something very deep and very mystical when we marry and remain faithful through times of trial my spouse has a brain tumor that has left her partially paralyzed if it were to resume growing it is in remission thanks be to god then perhaps the time would come when we could not have sexual relations that s life the lord would certainly not give me permission to seek someone else to satisfy my needs the idea that it is alright to divorce if a couple grows apart seems to me to lead to such a monstrous destruction of the meaning of marriage that i feel we must make every effort to avoid any hint of compromise we have become so petty and small minded that some husbands are threatening to divorce their wives unless the wives lose weight i praise the lord for guiding me to marry my wife she married me anyway despite the possibility that i could have a terrible illness and it turned out that she was the one with the brain tumor but had i known i wouldn t have cared either and maybe i ll be in a car accident tomorrow and become paralyzed from the neck down a married couple should deal with these situations with the help of the lord not divorce and run away from them
re mormon temples i was wondering if anyone knew any changes to the temple ceremony within the last fifty years also why do you think they were made revelation assimilation to mainstream christianity etc i know that the god makers was published quite a while ago could rituals have been changed since then i am also very interested in the influence of freemasonry on early mormonism especially in the smith family and in the nauvoo settlement info on any new studies would be appreciated thanks freddie eaton llcoolj athena mit edu
re homosexuality issues in christianity can someone cite biblical references to homosexuality being immoral other than leviticus so far when i ask around here i get the verses from leviticus spouted at me but the whole rest of that book tends to be ignored by christians haven t seen any stonings in a long time later max bob muir the list was posted not long ago as i recall aside from lev commonly cited passages are the story of sodom note however that this was a homosexual rape and there s no disagreement that that is wrong i take an intermediate position on this note that sodom is referred to elsewhere in the bible for its sinfulness it doesn t seem to have been known specifically for homosexuality rather i think it was considered a cesspool of all sins however from what we know of jewish attitudes homosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action described it almost seems to have been contrived to combine about as many forms of evil in one act as possible homosexual rape of guests who were actually angels but this story is not specifically about homosexuality in the nt the clear references are all from paul s letters in rom there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil note that the passage isn t about homosexuality it s about idolatry homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment or at least result of idolatry there are a number of arguments over this passage it does not use the word homosexuality and it is referring to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality so it s not what i d call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality but it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway that paul shares the general negative jewish attitude towards homosexuality the other passages occur in lists of sins in i cor and i tim unfortunately it s not entirely clear what the words used here mean there have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning such as wanton and that another may be specifically male prostitute again we don t have here a precise teaching about homosexuality but it is at least weak supportive evidence that paul shared the ot s negative judgement on homosexuality jude is sometimes cited however it s probably not relevant the context in jude involves angels since those who were almost raped in sodom were angels it seems likely that strange flesh refers to intercourse with angels as you can see the nt evidence is such that people s conclusion is determined by their approach to the bible conservatives note that the passages from paul s letters imply that he accepted the ot prohibition this is enough for them to regard it as having nt endorsement liberals note that there s no specific teaching and no clear definition of what is being prohibited or why is the concern in rom the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship what exactly do the words in the lists of sins mean thus some believe it is legitimate to regard this as a attitude paul took with him from his background and not a specific teaching of the gospel this is an explosive topic which tends to result in long dissertations on the exact meaning of various greek words but it s clear to me that that s mostly irrelevant what it really comes down to is whether people are looking to the bible for law or whether they believe that such as approach is inconsistent with the gospel this appears to depend upon one s reaction to the message of the bible as a whole as well as one s perception of the needs of the church today this is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference between protestant and catholic in the th cent and one where both sides believe that the bible is so obviously on their side that they keep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the other side will finally come to their senses that makes things very frustrating for a moderator who realizes that such an optimistic outcome is not very likely clh
god morality and massacres a listmember d andrew killie i think wrote in response to the suggestion that genocide may sometimes be the will of god any god who works that way is indescribably evil and unworthy of my worship or faith nobuya higgy higashiyama replied as in substance did others where is your source of moral standards by which you judge god s behavior it is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge god s actions who is the clay to talk back to the potter but we find a contrary view in scripture when god proposes to destroy the city of sodom genesis abraham says suppose that there are some good men in the city will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked far be it from you lord to do such a thing shall not the judge of all the earth do right i am told that the hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this and can perhaps be better rendered dynamic equivalence as shame on you lord if you do such a thing there are those who say that the definition of good is whatever god happens to want but if that is so then the statement that god is good has no meaning it simply says that god does what he wants that being the case no one can either love or obey god because he is good the only motive left for obeying him is that he is powerful just as it makes sense to obey a dictator even when he tells you to round up all jews and exterminate them because if you defy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself so it makes sense to obey god because he has the power to punish you if you don t this ethical theory i take to be in radical contradiction to genesis and to christianity in general any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any further discussion of morality or of the goodness of god meaningless however it does not follow that our moral judgements are always infallible in particular cases still less our judgements in particular cases about the course of action most likely to achieve a good result when i read the scriptural accounts of the actions of god in history those actions often seem to me very different from what i might expect of a god who loves us and desires what is best for us moreover leaving the scriptures aside and considering the natural world i find that nature is often very different from what i might expect if it were the work of a benevolent deity origen said those who believe that the author of nature is also the author of the scriptures must expect to find in the scriptures the same sort of difficulties that they find in nature now that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an argument against the existence power wisdom and goodness of god on the contrary their absence would be such an argument suppose that i am watching bobby fisher play chess and suppose that every time he makes a move i find myself nodding and saying good move just what i was expecting him to do same move i would have made if i were playing that would be a sign that fisher is no better a chess player than myself given that he is better i expect that at least some of his moves will have me thinking now what do suppose induced him to do that or even boy that was a real slip he s just thrown the game away similarly if god understands the workings of the universe better than i do it is to be expected that sometimes it will look to me as if he has made a mistake one difference between fisher at the chessboard and god at the controls of the universe is that i can see the end of the chess game if fisher wins i revise my earlier inference that it was carelessness that made him lose his queen moves earlier however if he loses and particularly if i can see that there was a time when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did not take it then i know that he is not as good a player as i had thought with god on the other hand i shall not in this life see the total result of some of his actions therefore my grounds for judging that i have seen a bad move on his part must always be far shakier than my grounds for making a similar judgement about fisher in the book of genesis we read that joseph s ten older brothers who with good reason found him insufferable conspired to sell him into slavery in egypt there he eventually became viceroy and when there was a famine in canaan he was able to provide for his family when his brothers nervously apologized he told them do not worry you meant to do me evil but god turned it into good i once heard a rabbi speak on this text he said the history of the jews is largely a history of events that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued survival of the religion or the people or both but amazingly those events turn out to be the saving of the jews and of judaism the sale of joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup of the family but in fact it ended with a reconciliation of the quarrel between them the famine that drove the family out of canaan looked like a misfortune for them but in fact if they had stayed in canaan they would almost certainly have intermarried with the canaanites and been assimilated into their culture their oppression by the egyptians a few generations after their arrival in egypt again looked like a disaster but god used it to bring them out of egypt and into the promised land here the people built a temple and regularly offered sacrifices but the babylonians captured jerusalem and judea destroyed temple and city and countryside and deported most of the people to babylon you might have thought that that would be the end of the people and the religion but it was not living in canaan the people had been under constant danger of assimilation again and again they had turned from the worship of the lord to the worship of the canaanite fertility cults with their ritual prostitution and ritual human sacrifice the babylonian captivity put a stop to that never again did the jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry neither the worship of the canaanites mor that of the babylonians ever again had a foothold among them nor is that all judaism had been in danger of becoming simply a system of sacrifices and temple observances the only prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to jerusalem every so often and offering a sacrifice during the captivity with the temple gone the jews invented the synagogue a place of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the scriptures they came to realize clearly what they were in danger of forgetting while they continued to live in judea that god is not simply a local or tribal deity not just the controller of the land of canaan or the patron of the jewish people but the creator of the world and the ruler and judge of all humans everywhere time passed and the babylonian empire was replaced by that of the persians and then that of the greeks or rather the macedonians the ruler antiochus epiphanes was determined to stamp out judaism and to this end he made the reading and the study of the torah punishable by death again one might think that this would be the end of judaism but it was not the people met for worship and instead of reading the torah portion appointed for the day they would read some passage from the prophets that had a similar theme and then discuss that before this time the torah the so called five books of moses genesis exodus leviticus numbers and deuteronomy were the only books read and studied in the synagogue if it had not been for antiochus the books of the prophets would probably have been forgotten altogether his hatred for judaism saved them other examples here omitted for brevity s sake some of you may remember that julie andrews first became famous as eliza doolittle in the stage production of my fair lady when warner brothers undertook to make a movie of it everyone expected that julie who had been so magnificent on stage would play the same role in the movie instead the studio decided to go with an established screen star and cast audrey hepburn julie andrews was naturally crushed but she later realized that if she had played the screen role she would have been type cast for life as an elize doolittle type it would have been a disaster for her as it was walt disney offered her the role of mary poppins and she won an oscar for it at the presentation she stood there smiling and looking at walt disney she said and now my special thanks to the man who made all this possible jack warner it was the most memorable line of the evening in a similar spirit we jews might thank the men who in the providence of god have preserved judaism and kept it alive to this day beginning with joseph s brothers and continuing with two pharaohs with nebuchadnezzar with antiochus epiphanes after the formal meeting had broken up one woman came up to him privately and said you were talking about the holocaust weren t you he answered if that is an example that came to your mind then you are right i was talking about it to you but i would not talk about it to everyone for not everyone can bear it i assume that he meant that without the holocaust there would have been no state of israel someone hearing the rabbi s lecture might leap to the conclusion that god is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish his purposes or at least that the rabbi thought so he might then go on to suppose that the wickedness is in fact god s doing that he stirred up joseph s brothers to a murderous hate against him and that when the israelites were in egypt god hardened pharaoh s heart so that he oppressed the people and would not let them go and this raises questions about how an action can be considered wicked and at the same time be considered something that god has brought about i suggest another way of looking at it consider a sculptor who has a log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue but the log instead of having a smooth even grain throughout has a large knot that spoils the appearance of the surface the sculptor considers the wood for a while and then carves a statue that features the knot that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color of the wood correspond to some feature of the statue so that observers will say how fortunate the sculptor was in finding a piece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place its presence is the crowning touch the thing that makes the statue a great work of art in reality the knot far from being what the sculptor was looking for was a challenge to his skill if the wood had not contained that flaw he would still have made a great work of art but a different one so if joseph s brothers had not sold him god would still have brought about his purposes for the jewish people but he would have done so in another manner if judas had not betrayed jesus if caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected jesus but had rather acknowledged him as the annointed of god if pilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set jesus free it might appear that there would have been no crucifixion and therefore no redemption and therefore no salvation not so god did not need judas sin to redeem us if judas had done right then god in christ would still have reconciled the world to himself we do not know how just as we do not know how michelangelo would have painted the sistine chapel if its interior had instead been shaped like grand central station and just as we do not know how bobby fisher would have won his fourth game agianst spassky if spassky had refused the exchange of bishops and had attacked fisher s knight instead don t bother to look up the game in question i am making up this example but the point is none the less valid thus we may say both that god used say the cowardice of pilate to accomplish his purposes and that the said cowardice was not god s doing and that pilate would not have thwarted god s plans by behaving justly and courageously what then are we to make of the place where god says to moses i will harden pharaoh s heart so that he will not let the people go some christians have taken this to mean that pharaoh was a puppet with god pulling the strings and that his stubbornness and cruelty were not his own work but the work of god in him i suppose rather that what god was telling moses was something like this if you see that pharaoh is not willing to let the people go do not be discouraged or suppose that the situation is out of my control my purposes will not be thwarted if pharaoh chooses to hear you and let the people go well and good if he does not i will fit his resistance into my plans and fit it so perfectly that future historians and theologians will suppose that i would have been thrown for a loss if pharaoh had obeyed me to return to the question that started this all off is it possible that the serbs in slaughtering the moslems of bosnia are instruments of god s will first point what they are doing is wrong just as what joseph s brothers did was wrong just as what judas did was wrong they intend it for evil if god somehow brings good out of it that does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and punishment second point of course god will bring good out of it but not the same good that he would have brought if the serbians had refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder nor does the good he purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right yours james kiefer
re question from an agnostic hi damon no matter what system or explanation of creation you wish to accept you always have to start with one of two premises creation from nothing or creation from something there are no other alternatives and if we accept one or the other of those two premises then again there are two alternatives either creation was random or was according to some plan if it was random i am unable to accept that the complex nature of our world with interrelated interdependent organisms and creatures could exist as they do therefore i am left with creation under the control of an intelligence capable of devising such a scheme i call that intelligence god i also prefer the creatio ex nihilo rather than from chaos as it is cleaner there is obviously no way to prove either or neither we are and we must have come from somewhere choose whatever explanation you feel most comfortable with damon you are the one who has to live with your choice shalom len howard

deuterocanonicals esp sirach dave davis writes let my state my point as provocatively as possible after going through several study bibles i m leaning heavily towards the assertion that sirach the wisdom of ben sira or ecclesiasticus is directly referenced by james in fact i think sirach is more directly referenced by james than job or ruth is referenced in any nt verse i ve seen good point the new testament does not quote ezra nehemiah esther ruth job ecclesiastes or song of songs just as it does not quote from the deuterocanon but if the non quotation of the former does not disqualify them neither does the non quotation of the later and the wisodm of solomon was quite clearly an influence on st paul especially in the letter to the romans cf especially romans and wisdom stuff deleted i think everyone would agree that principles that cannot be consistently applied are not very useful as principles so if we are to exclude them not accord them the authority of scripture we would appear to require other reasons what might these reasons be tradition always a fav with episcop tradition is equivocal on this subject sirach i believe is in vaticanus sinaiticus i don t know if it is listed in the muratorian canon the oldest list i know of sirach and the others are discussed by the fathers as scripture but not unanimously true not all accepted them as scripture though niether were all the books of the new testament so accepted which puts to the lie the whole argument of the books being excluded because they were debated and not universally accepted hebrews the apocalypse peter esther and others were debated at various times but eventually retained as for the codexes you mention both vaticanus and sinaitcus include the deuterocanon bothe of the new and old testaments and vaticanus i think inlcudes clement the shepard of hermas and the epistle of baranabas as for the muratorian canon it deals with the new testament only though it is very valuable in its witness to those books my interim conclusion is that protestant exclusion of at least one of these writings is one of those traditions of men one hears of so often they were excluded during the reformation and that appears to be the reason many people continue to exclude them any takers i can be reasonable if all else fails show me where i m wrong you re not wrong it is a tradition of men to exlcude them as i will explain below that nothing be read in the church under the nmae of divine scripture except the canonical scriptures and the canoncial scriptures are genesis exodus leviticus numbers deuteronomy joshua judges ruth four books of kingdoms being samuel and kings two books of paralpomenon being chronicles job the psalter of david the five books of solomon being proverbs ecclesiastes song of songs wisdom of solomon and misatributed to him the wisdom of jesus son of sirach the books of the twelve minor prophets isaiah jeremiah being jeremiah the lamentations baruch and the letter all of which were formerly counted as one ezekiel daniel tobit judith esther two books of ezra being ezra and nehemiah two books of maccabees and of the new testament four books of the gospel one book of the acts of the apostles thirteen letters of paul the apostle one letter of the same to the hebrews two of peter the apostle three of john one of the apostle jude one of the apostle james one book of the apocalypse of john council of hippo statute ad this same list was promulgated again at the third council of carthage ad and at the sixth council of carthage ad at which council the same list was enumerated with the words because we have recieved from the fathers that these are the books to be read in the church which ought to quiet those who assert in the name of holy scripture we do understand those books of whose authority there was never any doubt in the church as the episcopal church does in removing the deuterocanon from the realm of scripture though the episcopalians hold them in high regard and read them in the church they are not counted as scripture by them and may not be used to prove dogma the lutherans hold out similarly earlier mention of the so called apocrypha as divine scripture can also be found and below i inlcude only a portion of the quotes calling it divine scripture that could be found among the writings of the fathers and this is the reason why the law of the old testament is reckoned as consisting of twenty two books so that they may correspond to the number of letters in the hebrew alphabet it is to be noted also that by adding to these tobias and judith there are twenty four books corresponding to the number of letters used by the greeks st hillary of poitiers commentaries on the psalms prologue ad the twenty two books according to the hebrews are jeremiah with lamentations and the letter reckoned as one and also there is maccabees origen commentaries on the psalms psalm ad divine scripture addressing itself to those who love themselves and to the boastful says most excellently baruch follows st clement of alexandria the instuctor of children ad i learned accurately the books of the old testament proverbs of solomon and also wisdom st melito of sardes fragment found in eusebius history of the church and dating from crica ad book it is likewise decreed now indeed we must treat of the divine scriptures what the universal catholic church accepts and what she must shun the list of the old testament wisdom one book ecclesiasticus one book tobit one book judith one book of maccabees two books st damasus i pope the decree of damsus section ad i would think this enough though more can be shown that the church has always accepted the deutero canon though parts have been disputed by various persons for if disputes involving the new testament deutero canon does not disqulaify those books i e hebrews james peter john jude revelation in protestant eyes than neither should it disqulaify the old testament books and i must point out that the jews only drew up their canon in ad years after the founding of the christian religion upon the cross why should we adhere to a canon that was drawn up by the faithless in reaction to the chrsitian use of the greek septuagint which includes the deutero canon as early as ad st justin had already accused the jews of mutilating the canon of scripture by their removal of certain books protestants apparently prefer to think that god s revelation was limited by a decree of the jews in the ordering of their the jews faithless canon and that he could not use other people like the apostles in drawing up the canon the apostles were most certain users of the septuagint as some of the old testament quotes use the wording of the septuagint and not the hebrew and the septuagint includes the deuterocanon
re deuterocanonicals esp sirach wagner grace math uh edu david wagner writes the deutero canonical books were added much later in the church s history they do not have the same spiritual quality as the rest of scripture i do not believe the church that added these books was guided by the spirit in so doing and that is where this sort of discussion ultimately ends david h wagner a confessional lutheran now thank we all our god whoah whoah whoah whoah what that last paragraph just about killed me the deuterocanonicals have always been accepted as inspired scripture by the catholic church which has existed much longer than any protestant church out there it was martin luther who began hacking up the bible and deciding to remove certain books not the fact that the catholic church decided to add some much later that is the reason for the difference between catholic and protestant bibles sorry for the tone but that comment really irked me mike walker mdw uxa cso uiuc edu univ of illinois

re is ot valid peir yuan yeh asks i wonder if the ot is not exactly like jewish history are they the same or part of them are the same how about torah are the first five books of ot as the same as torah yes yes and yes jewish history as recorded in the old testament and as shown by archaeology are the same kings revivals temples and all the torah as far as i know is the five books of moses then come the prophets all the prophets plus joshua judges samuel kings and the writings psalms proverbs lamentations ruth esther ezra nehemiah ecclesiates song of songs chronicles job and the veracity of isaiah which you quoted to your moslem friend is quite well known a complete manuscript exists that dates back to past bc and is kept in a museum in israel it was found among the dead sea scrolls which greatly enhanced our knowledge of the veracity of the old testament as they date back to around the time of christ whereas before the oldest complete manuscript in hebrew was from around ad your moslem friend is sorely mistaken but understandably so if jesus was crucified and atoned for our sins he must have been god for only the death of god could atone for the sins of all humanity and as isaiah predicts the messiah will be called the mighty god and if he was god then he must have rose for as st paul wrote it was not possible that death could hold him and if jesus rose from the dead your moslem friend would have little reason to be a moslem which is why he denies the authenticity of the old testament andy byler
re revelations babylon rex rexlex fnal fnal gov writes it is also of interest to note that in on the occasion of a jubilee pope leo the th had a medallion cast with his own image on one side and on the other side the church of rome symbolized as a woman holding in her left hand a cross and in her right a cup with legend around her sedet super universum the whole world is her seat you read more into the medal than it is worth the woman is the church catholics have always called our church holy mother church and our mother an example would be from st cyprian of carthage who wrote in ad can anyone have god for his father who does not have the church for his mother hence the image of the church as a woman holding a cross and a cup which tell of the crucifxition of our lord and of the power of his blood the grail legend but also more significantly it shows that this is the cup of the new covenant in my blood which shall be shed for you and for many luke the cup represents the new covenant and holds the blood of redemption the fact that the woman is holding both and is said to have the whole world for her seat is that the catholic church is catholic that is universal and is found throughout the world and the church shows the crucifixtion and applies the blood of redemption to all mankind by this spread of hers thorugh which the holy sacrafice of the mass can be said and celebrated in all the nations as malachi predicted in malachi from the rising of the sun to its setting my name is great among the gentiles and everywhere there is sacrafice and there is offered to my name a clean oblation for my name is great among the gentiles says the lord of hosts and so we acknowledge what st paul wrote for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you show the lord s death until he comes corinthians you are quite right about the identification of babylon the great mother of all harlots with rome i think we simply disagree as to what time period of rome the apostle john is talking about andy byler
re revelations babylon hal heydt writes that was only the fall of the western empire the eastern empire continued for another years and a key element in it s fall was the christian sack of constantinople note that i said the fall of rome not of the empire the roman empire lasted until with its transfered capital in constantinople the main reason for it s fall was not so much the sack of constantinople by the men of the th crusade who were not christians they had been excommunicated down to the last man after attacking the christian city of zara in croatia but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle of mazinkert after the turks breached the frontier it was only a matter of time before the empire fell the inability of the empire to hold onto the rim of anatolia with the ottomans and rum seljuks in the middle should be quite obvious to any student of history the sack of constantinople only hastened the inevitable along for if the greeks had wanted to save their empire why would they not cooperate with the crusaders when they came to do battle with the saracens in the st rd crusades because of their obstinacy over cooperating with people they considered heretics even though those heretics were fighting for the cause of the empire and christendom in doing battle with the turkish hordes in anatolia edessa lebanon palastine and syria the some hordes who were to later sack constantinople and overrun a third of europe the balkans hungary the ukraine the caucasus etc andy byler

re serbian genocide work of god vera shanti noyes writes this is what indicates to me that you may believe in predestination am i correct i do not believe in predestination i believe we all choose whether or not we will accept god s gift of salvation to us again fundamental difference which can t really be resolved of course i believe in predestination it s a very biblical doctrine as romans shows among other passages furthermore the church has always taught predestination from the very beginning but to say that i believe in predestination does not mean i do not believe in free will men freely choose the course of their life which is also affected by the grace of god however unlike the calvinists and jansenists i hold that grace is resistable otherwise you end up with the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of god timothy for god must give enough grace to all to be saved but only the elect who he foreknew are predestined and receive the grace of final perserverance which guarantees heaven this does not mean that those without that grace can t be saved it just means that god foreknew their obstinacy and chose not to give it to them knowing they would not need it as they had freely chosen hell people who are saved are saved by the grace of god and not by their own effort for it was god who disposed them to himself and predestined them to become saints but those who perish in everlasting fire perish because they hardened their heart and chose to perish thus they were deserving of god s punishment as they had rejected their creator and sinned against the working of the holy spirit yes it is up to god to judge but he will only mete out that punishment at the last judgement well i would hold that as god most certainly gives everybody some blessing for what good they have done even if it was only a little for those he can t bless in the next life he blesses in this one and those he will not punish in the next life will be chastised in this one or in purgatory for their sins every sin incurs some temporal punishment thus god will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it cf samuel david s sin of adultery and murder were forgiven but he was still punished with the death of his child and i need not point out the idea of punishment because of god s judgement is quite prevelant in the bible sodom and gommorrah moses barred from the holy land the slaughter of the cannanites annias and saphira jerusalem in ad etc if jesus stopped the stoning of an adulterous woman perhaps this is not a good parallel but i m going to go with it anyway why should we not stop the murder and violation of people who may or may not be more innocent we should stop the slaughter of the innocent cf proverbs but does that mean that christians should support a war in bosnia with the u s or even the u n involved i do not think so but i am an isolationist and disagree with foreign adventures in general but in the case of bosnia i frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily involved it would not be a just war blessed after all are the peacemakers was what our lord said not the interventionists our actions in bosnia must be for peace and not for a war which is unrelated to anything to justify it for us andy byler
re the doctrine of original sin eugene bigelow writes doesn t the bible say that god is a fair god sic if this is true how can this possibly be fair to the infants what do you mean fair god is just giving to everyone what they deserve as all infants are in sin from the time of conception cf romans psalm they cannot possibly merit heaven and as purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins it is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven hence the unbaptized infants are cut off from the god against whom they with the whole of the human race except mary have sinned which is why jesus said truly truly i say to you no one can enter the kingdom of god unless he is born of water and spirit which is the true meaning of born again john thus as infants are in sin it is very fair for them to be cut off from god and exlcuded from heaven as st augustine said i did not invent original sin which the catholic faith holds from ancient time but you who deny it without a doubt are a follower of a new heresy de nuptiis lib c andy byler

re gun control was re we re mad as hell at the tv news jim de arras jmd cube handheld com wrote last year the us suffered almost wrongful or accidental deaths by handguns alone fbi statistics in the same year the uk suffered such deaths scotland yard statistics the population of the uk is about that of the us weighted for population the us has x as many handgun related deaths as the uk and no the brits don t make up for this by murdering x as many people with baseball bats you just can t compare this way all homicides must be shown per capita not just handguns the availability of them in the usa makes them the preferred murder weapon but ban them and some other weapon will step in as the favorite as a favorite sure as lethal not likely a study of violence in chicago produced this table percentage of reported gun and knife attacks resulting in death weapon deaths as percentage of attacks knives total attacks guns total attacks source firearms and violence in american life it might be contended that if gun murderers were deprived of guns that they would find a way to kill as often with knives if this were so knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide would be expected to show a low fatality rate and knife attacks in cities where guns were not so widely used like vancouver would show a higher fatality rate but the nat l commission on the causes and prevention of violence task force analyzed the data and found this not to be the case it appeared to them that as the number of knife attacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants the proportion of fatal knife attacks did not increase relative to the proportion of gun attacks in fact the reverse was true what was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on the part of the assailant to kill fatalities caused by knife tended to show a single mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave physical injury multiple stabs wounds wounds concentrated about the head neck and chest etc most gun homicides did not show this pattern rather more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of rage and not the focused intent to kill the victim source report on firearms and violence then since england usa my ancestors left because of the oppression you must compare england before strict gun laws to england after strict gun laws to be able to draw any meaning at all england has essentially legalized drugs so there are no drug gangs battling for turf etc there if you drop out the drug related killings here the usa would look a whole lot more peaceful there are a lot of factors which make a difference actually i m not fond of making any kind of social parallels between europeans and americans there are more cultural beahvioral and economic differences between us than similarities i just sort of found myself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks i don t think we could ever attain the low levels of european violent crime here in the us whether we banned guns or required every law abiding citizen to carry a loaded uzi on the other hand we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more culturally similar namely the canadians in fact an exhaustive seven year study has already been done of the respective crime rates of vancouver british columbia and seattle washington cities with roughly the same population urban economy geography and crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control in seattle handguns may be purchased legally for self defense after a day waiting period a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed weapon the recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted in vancouver self defense is not considered a valid or legal reason to purchase a handgun concealed weapons are not permitted recreational uses of handguns target shooting collecting are regulated by the province purchase of a handgun requires a restricted weapons permit a permit to carry may be obtained in order to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs handguns transported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box in short gun control but not unreasonably so both cities aggressively enforce their gun laws convictions for gun related offenses carry similar penalties the researchers studied all cases of robbery assault simple and aggravated burglary and homicides occurring in seattle and vancouver from to in defining the cases they used the same standard the fbi s unified crime report results during the seven year study the annual rate of robbery in seattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in vancouver burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates assaults were recorded in seattle versus in vancouver the risk of being a victim of a simple assault in seattle was found to be only slightly higher than vancouver and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher however when aggravated assaults were subdivided by weapon and the mechanism of assault a clear pattern emerged although both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated assault involving knives and other dangerous weapons firearms were far more likely to be used in seattle in fact times as often over the seven year study homicides occurred in seattle per vs homicides in vancouver per after adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in seattle as compared to vancouver was found to be when homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death the rate of homicide by knives and other weapons excluding firearms in seattle was found to be almost identical to that in vancouver virtually all of the increased risk of death in seattle was due to a more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms handguns accounted for roughly of homicides involving firearms handguns were times more likely to be used in homicides in seattle than in vancouver the authors of the report also investigated legally justifiable homicides self defense only such homicides occurred during the seven year study of which were committed by police only cases of civilians acting in self defense occurrred in seattle and in vancouver only involved firearms after excluding these cases there was virtually no impact on these earlier findings this is i feel a very fair report one might even make the argument that it is biased against canada as a whole because vancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times that of ottawa calgary and toronto while seattle reports annual homicide rates only half to two thirds that of nyc chicago los angeles and houston critics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access to handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because persons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a gun or will kill by other means this report shows differently if the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by the strength of intent than by the availability of weapons we could expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to be higher in vancouver than in seattle however during the study interval vancouver s rate of homicide by weapons other than guns was not significantly higher than that in seattle suggesting that few would be assailants switched to homicide by other methods as well ready access to handguns for self defense by law abiding citizens was not endorsed in this report although seattle did experience a higher rate of firearm death for self defense these cases accounted for less than of the homicides in both cities during the course of the study period and as was reported seattle apparently didn t enjoy relief

vancouver seattle study critiques open letter by dr paul h blackman research coordinator for nra ila nra official journal dear sir by now we are used to the new england journal of medicine s publication of small scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are drawn which are quantum leaps from the data followed by announcements of momentus scientific findings these are regularly released to the press without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs and often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings generally while they at least present a few interesting data however meaningless the studies misinterpret statistics and ignore or belittle serious studies by criminologists the latest effort handgun regulations crime assaults and homicide a tale of two cities by j h sloan et al with the accompanying editorial firearms injuries a call for science by two employees of the centers for disease control november however is an insult to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few data and so many flaws that i feel compelled to write at some length to call attention to various major and minor failings in no particular order the authors misleadingly cite wright et al ref to support the statement that some have argued that restricting access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate of homicide wright et al in fact studied and rejected that contention the authors pretended that vancouver and seattle are very similar cities with similar economic circumstances histories demographic characteristics and the like in fact the cities are very different with very different demographic characteristics which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in seattle both cities are over three forths non hispanic white and the non hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be the same in seattle and vancouver it is the different back grounds problems circumstances and behaviors of the various ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide the authors pretend they are evaluating canada s gun law compared to washington state s but they do not examine at all the situation in vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect in as it happens in the three years prior to that vancouver averaged homicides per year one eighth involving handguns ref and in the seven years of the nejm article there were homicides per year one eigth involving handguns surely even the medical profession recognizes that one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding that a change made a difference would a physician conclude that a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day for seven years because his cholesterol level was without at least seeing if it was before he started the regimen the authors pick two medium sized cities to evaluate a national gun law nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily selected sample seattle appears to have been selected because it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific reason would physicians call something a scientific study which involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar control had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen opposite scientific conclusions would follow vancouver s homicide rate exceeds that of such wild west cities in texas as el paso corpus christi austen and in colorado colorado springs ref the authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or handguns are far more commonly owned in seattle than in vancouver they use two surrogate approaches in pretending to study the availability of firearms handguns the first is an apples and oranges effort to compare the number of carry permits in seattle to the number of registered handguns in vancouver but the number clearly understates the number of handguns in seattle and counts primarily protective handgun owners the second however tells nothing about the number of handguns in vancouver and counts non protective handguns for the most part where is it difficult to obtain handguns legally for protection registration figures are meaningless there are registered handguns in new york city new york daily news sept comparing the two that method suggests about handguns per population in new york city compared to in vancouver meaning vancouver has a greater prevalence of weapons than new york city the second method of measuring gun density is cook s gun prevalence index a previously validated measure of intercity differences but the validation was by cook of his own theory ref normally second opinions are sought from a different doctor more significantly the cook index is based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement in suicide and homicide so the authors are basically taking a measure of misuse unsurprisingly gun misuse in homicide in seattle in vancouver is related to gun misuse in homicide plus suicide divided by two in seattle in vancouver the authors are not measuring the relative avail ability of firearms or of handguns in seattle and vancouver the authors misstate the laws of both washington and canada they neglect to mention the significant fact that washington has a waiting period and background check prior to the purchase of a handgun and that provisions exist in canadian law for owning and carrying handguns for personal protection the authors also make it appear that it is more difficult to get a handgun legally in canada than is actually the case the authors ignore all other factors which might explain the differences in crime rate beyond some vague mention of the penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of clearence for one particular offense homicide involving a firearm there is no measure of the differences in the number of law enforcement officers their aggressiveness in making arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions arrest rates for other offenses conviction rates actual sentences imposed for gun related crimes violent crimes without guns or gun law violations or incarceration rates whereas social scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences the authors of the nejm tale of two cities fail even to mention most factors related to crime control the authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective means for protection unless the criminal is killed such is not the case criminologists ref have found that almost americans annually use handguns for protection from criminals and that using a gun for protection reduces the liklihood that a crime rape robbery assault will be completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury to the victim it is interesting nonetheless that the authors reported the same number four of civilian justifiable homicides without firearms in each city but that less restrictive seattle accounted for of the reported civilian justifiable homicides involving firearms the centers for disease control which funded the study editorially praised the paper ref saying it applied scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb advocates of stricter regulation of firearms particularly handguns there is nothing in the paper which could possibly be mistaken for scientific methods by a sociologists or criminologists the vancouver seattle study is the equivolent of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding two ordinary looking middle class white males one aged and the other and without first taking their vital signs administering the experimental drug to the year old while giving the year old a placebo then taking their blood pressure and on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure announcing in a special article a new medical breakthrough it would be nice to think that such a study would neither be funded by the cdc or printed by the nejm since the longstanding anti gun biases of the nejm and the cdc make them willing to present shoddy research as scientific breakthroughs in special articles and editorials relating to firearms we are obligated to correct the record by notifying the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight over the activities of the centers for disease control about the distortions contained in handgun regulations

a call for science nejm guns and sputter by james d wright from july issue of reason free minds free markets someone once wrote statistics are like a bikini what they real is suggestive but what they conceal is vital the problem is demonstrated by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide funded by the federal government and published last year in the new england journal of medicine the study compared homicide rates in seattle and vancouver and suggested that a handgun ban may reduce the rate of homicide in a community the nine medical doctors who published handgun regulations crime assaults and homicide essentially reasoned in three steps despite many historical social and demographic similarities vancouver has a markedly lower homicide rate because its stricter gun regulations make guns less available the second step in their reasoning seems indisputable the overall homicide rate in seattle for the period was per popuation compared with in vancouver homicide is definitely more common in seattle the question then becomes why the authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case to support the notion as claimed in the third step of their reasoning that vancouver s handgun regulations are much more stringent but their evidence on the difference in gun availabilty is indirect and unpersuasive indeed they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point does not exist they offer two fragments of inferential data in support of the claim that guns are more available in seattle but for all anybody knows as a matter of empirical fact the opposite could be true we are therefore being asked at the conclusion of the study to believe that a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established indeed the situation is even more troublesome the first of the two indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed weapons permits issued in seattle and the number of restricted weapons permits issued in vancouver differences between the two cities in the permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable the second bit of evidence is cook s gun prevalence index which stands at percent for seattle but only percent for vancouver cook s index however does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in various cities it measures gun misuse it is an average of the percentage of homicides and suicides involving firearms in the present case the index shows only that in homicides and suicides firearms are more likely to be used in seatte than in vancouver to take cook s index as a measure of general firearms availability it must be assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides is directly related to their relative availability in the general population but this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove to assume what one is seeking to prove then to prove it on the basis of that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything even if we were to grant on the basis of no compelling evidence that guns are less common in vancouver we might still question what causes what the authors attribute seattle s higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun ownership but it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns in other words that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership not vice versa in fact it was once commonly argued that great britain s low rate of violent crime was a function of that nation s strict gun laws and the consequent low rate of gun ownership until british researcher colin greenwood found that great britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted to invoke an ancient methodological saw correlation is not cause nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data on gun ownership the authors say seattle and vancouver are similar in many ways implying that they differ mainly in gun availability gun law stringency and crime rates this is an evident attempt to establish the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis that all else is equal among things being compared clearly the two cities are similar in some ways but a closer look reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime or homicide rates the cities are closely matched in what percentage of their population is white percent and percent but seattle is about percent black while vancouver is less than percent vancouver s minority population is overwhelmingly asian so although the authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half dozen readily available demographic indicators they have not shown that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out in fact the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is particularly relevant in light of the study s breakdown of homicide rates according to the race of the victim for the white majority the homicide rates are nearly identical per in seattle in vancouver the differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities for blacks the observed difference in homicide rate is to and for hispanics to methodoligical complexities render the asian comparison problematic but it too is higher in seattle than in vancouver racial minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in seattle than in vancouver the white majority is equally likely to be slain in either city since the nearly initial difference in homicide reates between the cities is due exclusively to or differences between minority groups it is fair to ask why postulated difference in gun availability or gun law strigency would matter so dramatically to minorities but not matter at all to whites can differential gun availability explain why blacks and hispanics but not whites are so much more likely to be killed in seattle than in vancouver studies in the united states incidentally do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership or are other explanations more plausible could the disparity between canadian and american rates of poverty among racial minorities have anything to do with it what are the relative rates of drug or alcohol abuse of homelessness among each cty s minority population the city of seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the mississippi unemployment among young central city nonwhite men in the united states usually exceeds percent what is the comparable canadian percentage the crucial point is that canada and the united states differ in many ways as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries absent more detailed analysis nearly any of these many ways might explain part or all of the difference in homicide rates in gross comparisons such as those between seattle and vancouver all else is not equal the authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide result in a complex picture they do not acknowledge that the ensuing complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument they also acknowledge that socio economic status is probably an important confounding factor in our comparison remarking further that blacks in vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in than the rest of vancouver s population given the evidence presented in the article it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between seattle and vancouver results from greater proverty among seattle s racial minorities but the authors pay no further attention to this possibility since detailed information about household incomes according to race is not available for vancouver the largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple example if one were to take all u s couties and compare them in terms of pervalence of gun ownership and crime or homicide rates one would find an astonishing pattern counties with more guns have less crime would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce crime or would one insist that other variables also be taken into account in this example the hidden variable is city size guns are more common in small towns and rural areas whereas crime is a big city problem if researchers failed to anticipate this variable or lacked the appropriate data to examine its possible consequences they coud be very seriously misled in the study at hand the authors matched two cities for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables and their results are impossible to interpret in the editorial firearm injuries a call for science accompanying the study two officials from the centers for disease control lauded the authors for applying scientific methods to a problem of grave public heath significance but in attempting to draw causal conclusions from nonexperimental research the essence of scientific method is to anticipate plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them out absent such effort the results may well seem scientific but are little more than polemics masquerading as serious research that this study is but one of a number of recent efforts all employing practical

re the usual in article viking ponderous cc iastate edu viking iastate edu dan sorenson writes yes i am pro gun and yes i do disagree with this statement nuclear weapons in and of themselves are dangerous radioactive decay of plutonium and uranium as well as the tritium in the weapon tends to be somewhat dangerous to living things can you say neutron flux can you say i get more background radiation from living in denver or having an office in a limestone building than i do standing next to a power reactor at full power or standing next to a nuclear warhead that is armed look up shielding in your dictionary you don t need six feet of lead to make decent shielding your dead skin cell layer does an excellent job on alpha particles and neutrons are slowed by mere water what do you think of you is but whatever the neutrons hit has a good chance of absorbing the neutron and becoming radioactive itself mostly that means water turning into harmless heavy water but some neutrons would also hit bones and the resulting harmfull secondard radioactives would remain in the body for decades i think an unshielded nuclear warhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard as for a shielded warhead i think a fair amount of maintaince is required for it to remain safely shielded e g storage in a dry temperature regulated facility etc for private ownership to be unregulated i think a single individual must be able not only to keep the weapon but keep it in a safe condition if any random private citizen could not properly keep maintain and store a nuclear weapon then some regulation is clearly appropriate plus these things have no self defense purposes it s kinda hard to justify their use as a militia weapon when at best they are meant for battlefield use low yield weapons or at worst for industrial target obliteration translation cities and population centers if the militia has as its job the overthrow of an illegal government they are indeed useful weapons to the militia i disagree with this purpose the job of the militia is to defend themselves and their community if you look at the american revolution as an example the militias won by seperating themselves from and becoming independent of a repressive government they didn t overthrow it and those communities canada and england for example that didn t defend themselves were still under that same old regime if the role of the militia were offensive to go out and destroy repressive governments nuclear weapons might be appropriate but their jobs is defensive and nuclear weapons aren t suited for that there is also the question of personal and collective arms the second amendment definately protects ownership of personal weapons since the very nature of the militia requires members to provide their own arms but it isn t clear if it covers other arms certainly not all members would supply for example a tank only a few could or if they were to be used effectively should however those providing the heavy weapons have a disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower the militias as the framers envisioned them were extremely democratic if only of the members supported the cause only would respond to a muster and the militia s firepower would be proportionately reduced militia firepower and the popular will were therefore linked but if a small minority of the members supplied a large fraction of the firepower in the form of heavy weapons this would all change the militia s firepower would depend on the will of a small minority not of the general public worse that minority would be quite different from the general public at the very least they would be much richer as a result i think the nature and character of the militia requires that each member provide a roughly equal share of the militia s firepower his personal weapons and some equitable fraction of a squad s heavier firepower frank crary cu boulder

letter to a liberal colleague l neil smith posted by cathy smith for l neil smith letter to a liberal colleague author s note adrian name changed to protect the guilty and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with the same editor at a famous new york publishing house dear adrian i m way behind schedule on my current book again so this reply to your note criticizing the recent magazine interview i gave and generally attacking gun ownership will necessarily consist mostly of assertions you re free to believe or not i can back with evidence and logic i ve neither time nor energy to present now i ve written fully on this topic before and will again in the future when i do i ll make sure you get copies there are many arguments i might make from the futility and danger of delegating self defense to the police see don kates in the jan wall street journal to the real effect of prohibition shifting consumers from newly outlawed handguns or semiautomatic rifles to items like sawed off shotguns or homemade bombs but i ll limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent with your note first the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility second publication of some latter day scientific study doesn t alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists i discussed in my interview annoying you so much in the process were lying third the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility fourth as often happens with these things the study doesn t support the gun prohibitionists original numerical contentions anyway but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older body of lies omissions and distortions fifth the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility sixth the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on countless occasions carl bakal author of no right to keep and bear arms even confessed to it publicly makes the value of this present study dubious to say the least seventh the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility eighth given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction you should be better aware than most people how progress in designing studies to prove whatever you want outstrips our ability to collect meaningful data a case in point we might agree on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist or years to create studies proving that pornography causes crime more naive and probably more honest efforts in the s and s clearly indicate the contrary ninth the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility tenth another reason to doubt all such studies is that human behavior as the austrian school of economics demonstrates is far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified the attempt to do so and then create public policy based on the resulting pseudo information is wrecking our civilization eleventh the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility twelfth the study is also worthless because it incorporates figures for suicide which is not necessarily a tragedy but basically another individual right sometimes with ancillary social benefits if anything perhaps suicide intervention should be a criminal offense thirteenth and finally the national rifle association officials quoted in the article whatever their shortcomings and they are many are correct in this instance the study is meaningless because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility and because of that adrian even if the study were valid it wouldn t deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however whenever and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody s permission in this i m ably assisted by gun prohibitionists themselves whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed people to go out and buy their first gun while they still can before the gun control act most of the shooting fraternity viewed handguns incorrectly as it turned out as inaccurate ineffective toys there probably weren t six million of them in the whole country now thanks to kennedy metzenbaum the bradys and their ilk america s greatest sporting goods sales team we probably manufacture at least that many every year the fascinating datum is that handgun control et al are perfectly aware of this so i guess you ll have to ask them yourself what their real motives are look gun making isn t an arcane or difficult art and by the way it s easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic the fact that i can still obtain my own weapon of preference the self loading pistol is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing this further even if it were difficult there are already a quarter billion firearms in america with an estimated half life of years possibly more for stainless steel guns are gonna be around a long time adrian whether you like it or not as for me to paraphrase elmer keith regardless of what the law provides or any court decides i m always going to be armed and i will always work to see that others are as well the bad news is that there are thousands more perhaps even hundreds of thousands where i come from we can t be stopped by passing laws we can only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and given both
