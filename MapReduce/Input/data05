re ide vs scsi in article c lkev hpj feanor xel com shaw feanor xel com greg shaw writes why don t you start with the spec sheet of the isa bus first you can quote scsi specs till you re blue in the face but if they exceed the isa bus capability then what s the point who said isa was necessary eisa or vlb are the only interfaces worth investing thousands of dollars e g a new pc s worth of money in then don t complain maybe it wasn t you that scsi was so expensive on pc s because all we ve had until a year or two ago was the isa bus ie no one buys scsi for isa because isa is slow are you saying that scsi on an isa bus is not an automatic winner when compared to ide you didn t read to carefully vlb ide uses the same connection mechanism as standard ide if transfer rate is limited by ide whether it s interfaced to isa eisa or vlb matters not i get different transfer rates out of my ide when i change my isa bus speed on mine for one thing scsi blows ide out of the water hands down if ide has better throughput why isn t it used on workstations and file servers ide is just a variant of the old ibm mfm at controller at least that s how it looks from a software point of view it was never meant to be an all encompassing protocal standard to be implimented across different platforms is there any argument that ide can or can t transfer data from the ide drive at least as fast as the drive is able to provide the data are scsi versions of ide drives able to deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their scsi interface because of a higher rpm platter different arrangement of heads etc given the original question scsi used only as a single hard drive controller is it then necessary to get a scsi drive that will do at least maybe megs sec for the scsi choice to make any sence what does a meg megs sec scsi drive cost no that s the nice thing on a multitasking os scsi can use both drives at once i ve got unix loaded on one of my pcs along with windogs and the os can only use one of the two ide drives at one time it s pretty ugly if data is going from one drive to another and if scsi has the ability to perform that transfer without the data having to go through the cpu or main memory then yes that is the optimal way to do it as far as i know ide can t do that but when the cpu wants data from both drives data to be stored in main memory are you saying that scsi can grab data from both drives at the same time and store transfer that data to main memory also at the same time working off irq and dma channel on an isa or whatever bus i just bought at quantum for my mac at home i paid for it i haven t seen ide drives cheaper a friend of mine just got a maxtor meg ide drive for that s million bytes or mega bytes with the basic interface he gets close to meg sec transfer on his does your figure include a few hundred for scsi drivers no actually we re talking about scsi being expensive simply because nobody did a common interface for the pc if they had a common read easily implemented method of adding scsi to a pc like as in a sun or mac then you d find scsi the connection medium of choice so you re saying that scsi would have been the default interface type considering that the vast majority of pc s don t have cd rom drives or tape backups or etc that most pc s only have or had hard drive and run dos that scsi hard drives cost a lot more than mfm or rll drives at the time and how common were scsi drives under megs to years ago there s a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that prevented scsi from becoming the connection medium of choice i won t argue that the scsi standard makes for a good well implimented data highway but i still want to know why it intrinsically better than ide on an isa bus when it comes to multi tasking os s when managing data from a single scsi hard drive on a single drive scsi is more expensive but on that point is it faster this is what all this is about do you get more performance for the money for all the people that will only have a single hard drive in their system regardless of the os will the scsi choice really give them more performance than ide but you bought your pc for expandibility so you d want to add more drives or whatever true but expandibility can also start on the bus which means the option is there for cd rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards you can add many different types of devices and access them concurrently no argument this is always held up to the first time scsi buyer as the best reason but how many scsi devices will the first time scsi buyer eventually acquire again does it make sense to go scsi for a single hard drive system a scsi device works on many different machines i have a mac and a pc at home and moving hard drives between them is very nice with scsi hook them up and away they go with all the postings on the scsi i or ii specs are you really sure that pc and apple scsi hard drives are compatible and even if they are is the data accessible from either machine ie are there no formatting partitioning or file table differences is it really plug n play scsi devices work together better than ide devices for instance recently i added an older connor meg ide to a maxtor meg ide the connor must be setup as the slave it will work no other way on scsi you set the address check the termination plug it in and away it goes so the c drive on the connor becomes a logical d drive to dos is this really a problem i have a problem with ide s mutual exclusion i notice that the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c to drive d is quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c to d on a scsi system under a multitasking os this is very noticable as many things can be going on at once after having two ide drives in my system for temporary file transfers i have never seen any differences when switching between drives nor have i ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives or to from the same drive one neat thing that i ve noticed lately a fringe benefit has been the ability to add older almost dead drives as storage on a scsi system with little problem we ve got a bunch of almost dead meg drives that i ve added to my pc i ve now got the interface full but it does allow me to have meg drives meg drive tape drive and meg drive all on the same card that is nice as long as the power supply can keep up i do believe that there is the possibility for up to ide drives on a pc simply put scsi is handier than ide no mysterious jumpers to figure out but what about mysterious and expensive drivers to figure out at least ide doesn t require drivers that consume precious conventional dos memory

re buslogic b questions beta support for the buslogic cards is not included with os any longer why not this is rather disappointing if you wish to install the beta from the cd rom you will need to rem out the adaptec device drivers as they have a nasty tendency to crash the buslogic cards when os attempts to use them thanks adaptec yep that s cause the latest and presumably all future adaptec drivers look for the string adaptec or something to that effect in the cards bios

re ide vs scsi in article c i fx fc ucdavis edu ez rocky ucdavis edu the great randalli writes can anyone explain in fairly simple terms why if i get os i might need an scsi controler rather than an ide will performance suffer that much for a mb or so drive if i don t have a tape drive or cd rom any help would be appreciated richard randall ez hamlet ucdavis edu there is a way in which a multi tasking computer actually gives you more cpu power then you had before and that is with i o overlap with i o overlap your cpu can continue to think while disk operations are underway whereas without overlap your cpu sits idly waiting for each disk operation to finish and disk operations take an eternity compared to a fast cpu so when you ve got multi tasking you want to increase performance by increasing the amount of overlapping you do one way is with dma or bus mastering either of these make it possible for i o devices to move their data into and out of memory without interrupting the cpu the alternative is for the cpu to move the data there are several scsi interface cards that allow dma and bus mastering ide however is defined by the standard at interface created for the ibm pc at which requires the cpu to move all the data bytes with no dma richard krehbiel richk grebyn com os will do for me until amigados for the comes along

re perfect mag mx f monitors in article apr brtph bnr ca adcock bnr ca doug adcock writes i ve been intently following the mag thread while waiting for mine to arrive in the mail there seems to be a lot of complaints about minor alignment problems with the mx f one article contained a comment that the owner called the factory and was told that his screen rotation was within spec that figure for image rotation would seem to be a little high on my nec fg the specs call for no greater than mm well my monitor arrived last night and sure enough it has a very noticable barrel distortion it s not dramatic but it is there and it is especially noticable when the image doesn t fill the entire screen the fact that it is worse on the right side doesn t help matters what i m trying to find out is if these minor imperfections are the norm or are most of their monitors perfect i don t want to send it back and get one with the same or an even worse problem does the factory consider this kind of thing normal and ship their monitors with less than perfect alignment i can t speak for mag innovision but as far as nec is concerned they are adjusted to factory spec before leaving the central usa distribution point ma for the eastern canadian market now here s the key nec knows that the monitors adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over distances with all the bumps rough handling and such and therefore expect and at least in theory require that the local distributor not dealer have it adjusted at the local service centre bull hn information systems in toronto before sale this is the correct and probably only way of having any chance of receiving a perfect monitor the definition of perfect seems to depend on how picky one is in my case quite are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections i for one was not willing to accept what i considered a substandard monitor and after two months of wrangling and direct contact with nec finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor not perfect imho but a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying convince me was normal the short answer is no don t accept these imperfections as normal because for the premium one pays for the larger screen monitors one has a right to expect higher quality and if you re persistent you ll receive it comments and opinions are mine not bnr s doug adcock adcock bnr ca bell northern research research triangle park nc regards paul yee yee nimios eng mcmaster ca

re ide vs scsi in article richk apr gozer grebyn com richk grebyn com richard krehbiel writes can anyone explain in fairly simple terms why if i get os i might need an scsi controler rather than an ide will performance suffer that much for a mb or so drive if i don t have a tape drive or cd rom any help would be appreciated so when you ve got multi tasking you want to increase performance by increasing the amount of overlapping you do one way is with dma or bus mastering either of these make it possible for i o devices to move their data into and out of memory without interrupting the cpu the alternative is for the cpu to move the data there are several scsi interface cards that allow dma and bus mastering how do you do bus mastering on the isa bus ide however is defined by the standard at interface created for the ibm pc at which requires the cpu to move all the data bytes with no dma if we re talking isa at bus here then you can only have dma channel active at any one time presumably transferring data from a single device so even though you can have at least devices on a scsi bus explain how all of those devices can to dma transfers through a single scsi card to the isa at bus at the same time also i m still trying to track down a copy of ibm s at reference book but from their pc technical manual page the fdd adapter is buffered on the i o bus and uses the system board direct memory access dma for record data transfers i expect to see something similar for the pc at hdd adapter so the lowly low density original pc fdd card used dma and the pc at hdd controller doesn t that makes real sense
re ide vs scsi in article apr grebyn com richk grebyn com richard krehbiel writes heck if ide used dma then you d hear all kinds of complaints about isa bus systems with more than m ram not working with their ide drives m is the dma addressing limit of the isa bus and if ide did dma there would be trouble there would be no problems as long as the os didn t set up a dma transfer to an area above the mb area the dma controller probably can t be programmed that way anyways so there probably isin t a problem with this besides like i said before the fdd controller uses dma channel and i don t yet believe that the hdd controllers any of them mfm rll etc don t also use dma

re ide vs scsi how do you do bus mastering on the isa bus by initiating a dma xfer seriously busmastering adapter have their own dma ability they don t use the motherboards on board dma which is much slower isa has no bus arbitration so if two busmastering cards in isa system try to do dma xfers on the same dma channel the system will lock or crash i forget their are dma channels in an isa system are bit are bit the system uses dma a soundblaster uses dma i could buy a busmastering xga video card a busmastering scsi ha in order for them to work properly i would have to find out what dma channel the xga card uses and then simply configure the scsi ha to use a different dma channel for its dma xfers i don t know if multiple dma xfers can go on at the same time on isa i m not sure if they can on eisa systems either i do know that on eisa mca systems you can allow bm cards to use the same dma channel thanks
re soundblaster irq and port settings they don t have a conflict because technically lpt does not use irq the parallel printer processor the actual number escapes me contains a printer control register which enables the chip to transmit an interrupt to the interrupt controller as irq then onto the main processor as int x f by default the parallel printer processor does not enable it s interrupt line therefore no int x f s will be sourced from the printer controller chip thus enabling other devices to use the actual irq note this applies to com ports also which by default do not route interrupts to the system bus although com s software usually enable this feature as it make monitoring com port activity easier than polling the serial uart thus probably getting the sound card slighty confused windows may be a different story

re recommendations for a local bus cache penio penev penev rockefeller edu wrote i have a maxtor mb on an isa ide controller although my machine is dx vlb i has the save transfer rate of mb s regardless of the variations of the isa bus speed i tested it with speed between mhz and mhz not any difference the problem is not the interface between the controller and the memory chris brinton brinton icd teradyne com wrote i also have a dx and a maxtor i have a local bus ide controller generic and i get kb s i tried swapping my local bus ide controller for an isa ide controller and my transfer rate went to kb s the specs for this drive show a maximum platter to controller transfer rate of mb s i dont know how to get there from here the local bus interface got me a little but certainly not as much as i had hoped i am also looking for a way to what is the deal with the ide transfer rates is anybody getting throughput anywhere close to the platter controller rate i haven t seen anything even close to the mb sec limit of the ide interface these drives are non interleaved aren t they here are the rates i get sequential read msdos c program that uses bios calls to read sector blocks sequentially from outside first track inward mhz bus mhz bus maxtor lxt kb sec kb sec quantum lps kb sec kb sec disk buffer read same c program but re reads the same block repeatedly so in effect is reading the ram buffer on the drive mhz bus mhz bus maxtor lxt kb sec kb sec quantum lps kb sec kb sec coretest v transfer rate seems to agree with above mhz bus mhz bus maxtor lxt kb sec kb sec quantum lps kb sec kb sec i managed to get hold of the quantum lps at product manual and it goes into excrutiating detail describing how the bits get from the platter through the controller and out the ide interface nowhere do i see anything like after the bits are whipped of the platter at high speed they sit around in a buffer to thaw before they are sent to the host even though i swear that s whats happening here are some relevent quotes from the manual data is transferred from the disk to the read buffer at a rate of mb s maximum mb s minimum my calculations show kb sec maximum and kb sec minimum disk spins at rpm with sectors per track on the outside and on the inside single burst errors of up to bits within one sector can be corrected on the fly in real time as they occur allowing a high degree of data integrity with no impact to the drive s performance i take this to mean error correction isn t the bottleneck for page mode operations the data transfer rate to and from the buffer ram is up to mb s this high transfer rate allows the at interface ic to communicate over the at bus at a data transfer rate of mb s while the dcs simultaneously controls disk to ram transfers so the thing can even do it s cache pre fetch while it s sending the requested sector it has kb read buffers for pre fetching i guess you could call that a cache so when i do a sequential read on the outer tracks why am i getting a measly kb sec when i should be getting around mb sec any of you hard disk engineers out there know wondering why my disks are so slow david o o ooo ooo david stam linux the choice of a gnu generation stam netcom com un x x r openlook gcc tex free

wanted your opinions on the insight talon ta or ta multimedia kits for those of you who might be familiar with insight distribution network inc and their multimedia kits i m seriously considering buying the insight talon ta mm kit which is bundled with the cd rom drive with ms access time kb dtr multispin multi session photo cd capability etc and with the pas sound card etc if you are familiar with insight you know the kit i mean i believe the drive is either a texel ms or an nec ms but it is not clear to me which one is actually a part of the bundle at least two of their sales people couldn t give me a straight answer as to which one ah yes one of the drawbacks of oem other questions excuse my ignorance but is texel a reputable maker in the cd rom market or do you think nec is the better drive bottom line is this kit worth the money currently for the ta and for the ta alternatively i was thinking that the ta might be overkill for my uses however i do want full multimedia capabilities photo cd stuff educational programs for my kids etc and considered the lower end ta kit and using the difference around to get something else useful like a tape back up drive unit basically i would just like to hear from those who have actually used these kits and whatever pros cons you might advise preferably directly to the email address below thanks koji koji kodama by nippon motorola ltd ryvg email sps mot com note the opinions expressed herein are mine and do not reflect the opinions or policies of motorola inc or its affiliates

mounting cpu cooler in vertical case i just installed a dx cpu in a clone motherboard and tried mounting a cpu cooler on the chip after about hour the weight of the cooler was enough to dislodge the cpu from its mount it ended up bending a few pins on the cpu but luckily the power was not on yet i ended up pressing the cpu deeply into its socket and then putting the cpu cooler back on so far so good have others had this problem how do you ensure that the weight of the cpu fan and heatsink do not eventually work the cpu out of its socket when mounting the motherboard in a vertical case will estes internet westes netcom com

re soundblaster irq and port settings these lpt com disk controller are call devices there are devices that requires exclusive interrupt ownership eg disk controller i and keyboard i there are also devices that does not require exclusive ownership ie it will share an interrupt with another device eg lpt no in a standard isa bus the one that almost all non laptop pcs use two separate interface cards cannot share an interrupt this is due to a screwup in the bus design for example if your soundblaster wants to drive interrupt number then it must hold a certain bus wire to or at all times depending on whether or not it wants an interrupt this precludes letting another card assert interrupt number when two or more devices in an isa bus pc share an interrupt it s because they re implemented by a single card andrew klossner andrew frip wv tek com
re zeos computers i have had a zeos for a couple months while the experience was not painless or perfect it was way better than that endured by most people i personally know who have ordered gateways of course several of the gateway buyers were rewarded by getting free stuff as gateway can t seem to keep track of what it has or hasn t sent out b i got the mb viper card the first one was defective but zeos replaced it with only minor hassles this one works fine i haven t noticed any problems in any of my applications i also ordered it because of all the complaints about the ati a few months ago guess you can choose either buggy state of the art stuff or robust average stuff for my particular configuration tower watt supply pkg no monitor viper etc the zeos was slightly cheaper than gateway austin etc but this can change from month to month mike

re orchid p vs fahrenheit mini review in article apr adobe com sherwood adobe com geoffrey sherwood writes in going with the modern trend the orchid p card only supports colors in x mode without a driver of course this breaks any dos program which uses svga modes like most of my cd roms this is not the case the rom on the p supports vesa modes of up to x in colors vesa compliant applications should have no trouble setting these modes but i m forwarding your posting to our software group just in case can t be too careful not that i doubt that your applications are failing to run lots of stuff depends on figuring out which exact svga they re looking at and don t use vesa calls vesa is still pretty new every new chip set confuses them the supported resolutions really annoy me you can do x at hz if you tell the driver you have an nec fg they only have about six monitors listed plus generic and if you choose generic you can t get any high refreshes at all but at x you are limited to hz seems to me that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth if it can do hz at it sure should be able to do it at higher vertical resolution was the main reason i bought the card over the orchid f vlb i currently have and it will do x x hz as well i think we go to at least hz at x x and maybe more and it s a function of the ramdac speed not the power we need to fix the problems you ve noted they were already on the list if you re really interested though take a look at the text file p res dat which holds the data from which the choices in the p monitor installation program are built working by analogy you can build up a new monitor definition that has the right combinations of refresh rates for your monitors keep a backup copy of the file once you ve built a new version of the p res dat file run the p installation program inst and your new choices should show up this assumes you have the weitek v drivers you can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of the driver is version microsoft uses this gimmick too the board is faster that the ofvlb for most things according to the hercules speedy program this program tests various operations and reports the results in pixels second i don t have the numbers for the graphite card but they were close to half of the ofvlb ie slower but that was running in a mhz isa so the numbers aren t really comparable the following numbers were all obtained using a mhz air motherboard umc chipset with mb memory i give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it computes them and these tend to jump around a bit the speedy benchmark was put out by hercules and iit who to my knowledge were unencumbered by any motivations except making the hercules graphite iit agx card look really good so i d take the numbers with a ton of salt texas instruments did the same thing with wintach trying to make the look good compared to the as if anyone cared it s safer though not safe to use benchmarks from unbiased sources such as testing labs columnists etc interestingly the solid vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement and hatched polygons ie filled with cross hatching and ternary rops whatever they are graphics operations like xors maybe are a dead loss on the i think you ll a large discrepancy between the results of speedy and the results of anything else in the universe on these things i give two numbers for the fonts because i think they are caching when the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly the speed of the ofvlb then the speed increases dramatically sounds like programming to a benchmark to me font caching is a perfectly legitimate optimization windows has hooks for it built right into the gdi what s kind of silly is iit s use of a hardwired the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog then sat on a tack string in their driver not only is it useless in real applications it lacks the programming elegance of the bart simpson optimization in which you save the bitmap of the most recently drawn string in off screen memory and just do a screen to screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string a second time in a row we call it the bart simpson optimization because bart s the only person we can see benefiting from it he could right i will not cheat on benchmarks a hundred times and be done in half the time it would take to actually form each character i make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all its just what i saw when i ran them on my computer i normally don t write disclaimers but this time maybe i d better my testing is totally unconnected with my work i program under unix on decstations is done completely without the knowledge blessing or equipment of my company we don t have any lawyers they re all working for

re ide vs scsi in article apr julian uwo ca wlsmith valve heart rri uwo ca wayne smith writes stuff deleted so the lowly low density original pc fdd card used dma and the pc at hdd controller doesn t that makes real sense actually it does make a reasonable amount of sense fixed disk sectors are buffered by the controller and transferring them to memory with a rep insw or whatever the instruction is called is quite efficient single instruction goes as fast as the controller cpu know how to use the bus since the wasn t cached the bus is likely a critical resource relative to cpu performance and it s possible that dma bus interference would cause as much or more loss of cpu cycles for computing as does the rep insw sequence the floppy on the other hand is not buffered so that using the cpu for floppy data transfer as was done on the pc jr by the way really does stink wally bass
re date is stuck in article apr oec orbital dialix oz au oecjtb oec orbital dialix oz au john bongiovanni writes stuff deleted did i once hear that in order for the date to advance something like a clock has to make a get date system call apparently the clock hardware interrupt and bios don t do this date advance automatically the get date call notices that a midnight reset flag has been set and then then advances the date anybody with more info there are two problems the bios tod routine which updates the bios clock uses only bit for day increment so a second wrapping of the clock past midnight will get lost if no one calls the bios to read the clock in the meantime and the bios resets the day wrap indicator on the first get date call from anybody after the wrap indicator has been set so unless the first bios get date call after midnight is done by the dos kernel which is the only part of dos which knows how to increment the date the day wrap indication is normally lost my guess is that kevin s menu system uses bios calls to read the clock in order to display the time and is hence the entity which causes the day wrap indication to get lost even if the menu system notices the day wrap which i think is indicated by a non zero value in al there really isn t any particularly good way to tell dos about it so that dos can update the day the menu system should use dos calls to get the time which would cause the dos kernel to do the bios call and the wrap indicator would hence be processed properly possibly though the menu system can t easily use dos calls for time because dos is not reentrant and perhaps time incrementing ofters occur while the menu system is inside some other dos call wally bass

list of ide harddisk specs configuration of ide harddisks last update collected by carsten grammes ph hucg rz uni sb de and published regularly on comp sys ibm pc hardware there is explicitly no warranty that the given settings are correct or harmless i only collect i do not check for myself there is always the possibility that the settings may destroy your hardware since i hope however that only well minded people undergo the effort of posting their settings the chance of applicability exists if you should agree or disagree with some setting let me know immediately in order to update the list if you possess a hd not mentioned here of which you know bios and or jumper settings please mail them to me for the next update of the list only ide at bus harddisks will be accounted for if not specified the landing zone should be set equal to the number of cylinders if not specified the write precompensation should be set there are bioses that don t even ask for it another statement maybe right ide harddisk don t have precomp and lzone the precomp is a built in parameter and lzone isn t used because most if not every ide disk has autopark the jumpers names are given as printed on the

described in the relevant product specification i a single drive environment the drive is described as a master in a dual drive environment the drives are described as a master and a slave this is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives when performing diagnostics there are four links lk lk lk and lk adjacent to the way interface connector they have the following functions and are described in order as viewed from the end of the drive with the first jumper described nearest the way interface connector lk led when fitted this jumper connects the led drive to pin of the interface this allows a led to be connected to the interface an external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with the led when this option is selected the value of the resistor will be dependant on the led type chosen but will be in the range of ohms ot ohms lk dual drives this jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single bus it fallows communication across the way interface connector indicating to the master drive the presence of a slave lk master when fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a master if there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be jumpered in this way lk iochrdy when fitted this connects the iochrdy signal to the drive it is fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher data transfer rate than the drive i e greater than mbytes per second when using interleave this jumper is not normally fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than mbytes per second there are four possible

re modems and uarts ryan jeffrey baucom rjbaucom eos ncsu edu wrote what is a uart i don t know the exact meaning of uart but i think it is something like universal arithmetic receiver transmitter normally the older boards have a or uart on board those chips generate an irq for every char they received the uart has an internal byte buffer so with the right software installed it generates an irq every chars what does it do for high speed modems is it necessary for k or higher throughput if you ran dos you don t need a because dos runs only one task at a time and the whole cpu power could be used for the transfer but if you are running a multitasking os such as os unix etc windows the cpu cannot work the whole time with one task the result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts is it only for internal modems no the only diffrence is that internal modems have the uart on board whereas external modems are connected to the computer over a serial port which has the uart on board if you have any experience with or higher speed modems please let me know what you think also any particular brand name reccomended or will a cheapo clone do just a well i use a zyxel b with a uart under coherent i m very satisfied with it but i think that nearly everyone is satisfied with his own modem michael michael jester gun de michael gerhards preussenstrasse germany neuss voice
ide cable i just bought a new ide hard drive for my system to go with the one i already had my problem is this my system only had a ide cable for one drive so i had to buy cable with two drive connectors on it and consequently have to switch cables the problem is the new hard drive s manual refers to matching pin on the cable with both pin on the drive itself and pin on the ide card but for the life of me i cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug in the cable to align these secondly the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them i figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into the drives does it matter which i plug into the master drive and which into the slave any help appreciated thanks

re help installing second ide drive another possibility is that the mb one is already partitioned into two seperate drives c and d and the cmos asks for c drive and d drive setup info rather than drive and drive like most others i ve seen could this be confusing things so i need help the drive came bereft of any docs except for some info for the cmos setup the controller has a little piece of paper about the size of an index card i cannibalized the cable it s one of those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle so it looks like a serial connection now i be lost many many thanks in advance this is practically an emergency i have two papers to do on this thing for monday help william barnes suranet operations wbarnes sura net voice fax disclaimer i don t speak for suranet and they don t speak for me i ve been told by our local computer guru that you can t do this unless you perform a low level format on your existing hard drive and set your system up for two hard drives from the beginning i took him at his word and i have not tried to find out any more about it because i m not going to back everything up just to add another hdd if anyone knows for sure what the scoop is i would like to know also thanks in advance also bill willis if you bought your ide drive from a dealer you shouldn t have to perform a low level format even if the st hd is already partitioned into c and d fdisk will automatically assign the nd hd to d and change the nd partition of st drive to e check the jumper settings and cmos setup in particular the correct number of cylinders and tracks

re cd rom multisession in article pgifo efb msuinfo cl msu edu gary ah cal msu edu writes as i said i know a multisession cd rom is necessary if you do more photos but what if it is just a writable cd rom drive and do a second session do you need one for that too if you write a second time to a cd you need to have multi session capability to read the second session whether it is photos or just data or whatever here is a simplified way of looking at it the first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks the second session has a newer directory structure but the first directory still exists because you cannot change only add so if you put that in a normal drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all data multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last directory written to the disc older systems look only for the directory not taking multiple directories into account lex van sonderen philips interactive media
disappointed by la cie approximately four months ago i purchased a quantum lps hd from la cie for after two months the drive started having problems first there were intermittent freezes then corrupted files and resources then silverlining wouldn t even recognize the drive so i got an rma from la cie and exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one well about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems often when i boot up my iisi i get the flashing question mark sometimes if i then insert the silverlining program i can get it to recognize the drive by making it scan over and over for drives at that point i can restart the iisi and boot from the hd i ve called la cie again and they ve given me another rma their tech support people tell me that if silverlining doesn t see the drive there s a definite hardware problem given that this is the second bad drive in four months i asked la cie to send me a new one but they said no also within three weeks after i purchased my original drive la cie dropped the price on it by over i can accept that a drive or two may be bad and i know that hardware vendors make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs and i understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden price fluctuations nevertheless taken together the convergence of these facts events have left a bad taste in my mouth i should have added above that when i asked la cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one they will send i think the data is still in good shape and i ll have to again reinstall everything from floppies they said it would cost me for data recovery it seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a discounted price and that replacements for new hardware gone bad still covered under a day warranty should be new i feel a little helpless about all this i don t mean to necessarily flame la cie their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful but c mon sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way i sent a letter to la cie s customer service when the first drive was returned and i asked them for a credit on the price difference since i had purchased the drive three weeks before they slashed the price i told them i would like to apply the credit toward the purchase of another la cie product they didn t even have the courtesy to reply one way or the other what s the moral of this story i m not sure but i do know i won t buy any other products from la cie in the future bill krauthammer f ehg umiami ir miami edu ps please don t email or post about how good your la cie product and service has been i m not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything like that all i m saying is that i ve had a disappointing experience with them and i ll be taking my business elsewhere in the future

re info on apple gc requested in article apr alijku edvz uni linz ac at norbert mueller k alijku edvz uni linz ac at writes newsgroups comp sys mac hardware in article prudhom iros serge prud homme prudhom iro umontreal ca writes any info on the video processor am that sit on it any way to program that chip what companie makes that chip apple was never able to provide any docs or tools to program that chip i value it as the least value per piece of computer hardware i ever bought due to the complete lack support tools there was a refund for us buyers of this card but we europeans were left out in the rain once again i agree completely but there was only a refund for people who bought the gc with a quadra i have seen an alpha version of an extension from apple called gc quicktime video which offloads quicktime compression decompression from the cpu to the am on the card so it seems it can be done even though in a developer article it states that the gc can t be programmed but they asked that any suggestions be sent in anyway steve margelis melbourne university
re mac os on a in article c bj e imag fr you write hillman hillman plk af mil wrote deathbird cmu edu donpaul c stephens kind of slated wouldn t you say who is going to throw all that to the side and get the mac os for not quite the point to be considdered here fact if when apple release system or what ever is current at the time of release then you will see shortly afterwards apple no longer producing hardware look at next with their nextstep to see what happens who is going to pay apples prices when they can get the same thing cheaper else where heck we can get a sun workstation cheaper than a quadra and infact we have a number of times it all comes down to if apple released this before windows was released i d be behind them they missed the boat so why is apple continued development will it support the p to its fullest capabilities run faster than windows it must do something significantly better than windows and os to warrent being released no the continued develeopment is because there is becomming less and less profit in hardware so the next step no pun intended well sort of is to make the money in software look at microsoft if you think it can t happen after all you can sell multiple pieces of software to one hardware platform as you also said windows is a nightmare for programmers so will the temptation to sell system to a couple of million dos users be too much for apple million copies is serious money sir office acme gen nz be thankfull that we dont get all the government we pay for

re what do y all think of the iivx in article p e tinnojp minerva cis yale edu bell peter yale edu peter bell writes my advisor has decided to get a mac for the lab now that we are funded again the consensus in the lab was that all we really needed was an lciii but he decided he wanted a centris the lack of an fpu on that machine and the price struck me as making it worth less than an lciii so i have suggested we get a iivx instead it seems heavily expandable and for what do people with iivx s think of them they seem like good machines to me and i like the nubus slots in case we ultimately decide we want to do work with video on it the iivx lciii performance at a centris price the only reason to get an iivx is if you really need the full size nubus slots keep in mind that the supports all apple monitors and has optional ethernet this lessens but doesn t eliminate the need for nubus cards and unless you re running fpu intensive software the will blow the doors off the lciii and the iivx the lciii on the other hand is sufficient for most people and has a great price if you haven t guessed i find halving the bus clock the iivx mhz up vs mhz bus a throughly bad thing and i hope apple never does it again joe finete jfinete cats ucsc edu
adapter cable for vga monitors does anyone know who makes a cable or adapter that is wired according to apple s specs that forces the external output on lc s and the powerbook s and duo into a true vga style output signal the nec adapter does not do this since their monitors are multisync they just route the signal into the correct pinout but do not switch the macs output into vga mode do i have to make one of these or does someone already have one made up the following is the apple spec for the lc cpu vga cable adapter i m assuming that the powerbooks duos will work with the same adapter macintosh lc to vga the macintosh lc can supply a x vga timed signal for use with vga monitors by using an adapter cable the standard macintosh lc supports vga to colors and with the optional k vram simm the vga monitor is supported to colors note the macintosh lc supplies signals capable of driving ttl level inputs however some low impedance input vga monitors do not work with the macintosh lc to connect a macintosh lc to a vga monitor you need to make an adapter cable from the macintosh lc video connector to the vga monitor following is the pinout description for the adapter cable macintosh lc vga video connector pin signal name red ground red video signal green video signal green ground blue video signal blue ground hsync vsync hsync ground nc sense sense tied together vga monitors are identified by shorting pin to pin on the macintosh lc video connector the macintosh lc grounds pin on its video connector which results in pulling down pin and gives the correct monitor id for a vga monitor this message was created on mcw bbs a jointly supported by new orleans mac user group national home school user group user maccomw uucp the views expressed in this posting those of the individual author only

re iisi clock upgrade hi i have been getting a lot of requests for this information so i thought i would post it for those interested parties sorry for length to increase the maciisi speed to mhz or mhz the clock must be changed from mhz to mhz or mhz respectively this is done by going to a static free work station or putting some aluminum foil down to work on open up the si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case remove the hard disk by disconnecting the power and scsi cables spreading the tabs and lifting the drive out remove the flopy drive remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting the supply straight up and out remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back bottom side of the fan and lifting straight up and out remove the mother board by spreading the tabs on the left and right side of the board and sliding the board forward then lifting the board out all connectors on the back of the board must be removed first desolder the mhz clock the one closest to the memory modules this is not easy even for a skilled solderer get an ic socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins by pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder them in insert a mhz or mhz clock put large power transistor heat sink s on the processor chip and the other large chip just to the right of the processor and figure some way to hold the heat sync s in place i made a simple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole in the board between the two chips mount the screw using insulated washers screw a cross member down over the heat sync s to hold them in place don t use too much pressure put it all back together and go for it disclaimer this is only the procedure i used and is not authorized by anyone you are on your own for this procedure i m quite sure it will void your warentee bye for now ralph durtschi idaho state university email durtralp ux isu edu

problems with a rose does anyone work with the a rose card we have the problem that after certain crashes the card disappears from the system and lets crash the mac then okay we don t use the card quite like one should because we simulate errors in the before every instruction some specified registers are masked eg to simulate a stuck at error in certain bits normally the crash instance of a rose notices a crash sets a flag and stops working by reading the mentioned flag the mac can notice a card crash that works fine for almost all crashes but as said sometimes the card doesn t set the flag and disappears from the system the documentation of a rose does not tell us anything about its behavior when crashing and so at the moment we are trying to understand by analyzing the assembler code and that s both frustrating and lengthy so can anyone help please only reply via email as i don t read this group department of computer science iv university of dortmund germany laf aennig e mail maennig veronica informatik uni dortmund de in the beginning god created adam ahem atoms atoms of hydrogen

adding int hard disk drive to iicx i haven t seen much info about how to add an extra internal disk to a mac we would like to try it and i wonder if someone had some good advice we have a mac iicx with the original internal quantum mb hard disk and an unusable floppy drive we also have a new spare connor mb disk which we would like to use the idea is to replace the broken floppy drive with the new hard disk but there seems to be some problems the internal scsi cable and power cable inside the cx has only connectors for one single hard disk drive if i made a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connectors each for motherboard for each of the disks would it work is the iicx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk what about terminators i suppose that i should remove the resistor packs from the disk that is closest to the motherboard but leave them installed in the other disk the scsi id jumpers should also be changed so that the new disk gets id the old one should have id it is no problem for us to remove the floppy drive as we have an external floppy that we can use if it won t boot of the hard disk thank you torbj rn rognes email rogntorb idt unit no

disappearing hard drive in lc the internal hd in my lc disappeared for a day last week and i d like to hear any reasonable theories folks can suggest for what happened it is an lc with mb of ram and an mb internal drive running system with a few scsi devices in a so far as i know properly terminated chain i had shut down the system for a day i was out of town and we sometimes have thunderstorms this time of year and upon restarting got a blinking question mark i booted from a floppy and saw that my external hd seemed okay but there was no sign of the internal i installed a system folder on the external and was indeed able to boot from it i tried things like disk first aid and silverlining to inquire about the internal drive they either could not find it or got errors in trying to talk to it silverlining claimed it was a connor drive but it is a quantum well i d backed things up so i was able to work but at some point i noticed that the internal had reappeared now disk first aid says that all s well etc things seem to be fine but what happened was this a warning that something the internal hd or something else is about to die i m definitely nervous and if this is a signal that the internal hd is sick is it true that i can only put up to a mb drive inside an lc some folks have claimed there s a limitation in the lc other n size or power while others and that includes lacie over the phone say anything that fits is okay thanks for answers

re lc ram upgrade will be slow douce tfsquad mn org andrew geweke writes i cannot speak for dale but i am quite sure that the macintosh uses the full bit or bit data path to its full advantage that is it is running as fast with two or four pin simms as it would with one pin simm now it may be that longword accesses assuming a bit data path here get the first byte from the first simm the second byte from the second and so on this would mean that each longword of memory is actually split among four simms one for each byte on the other hand it could be that the simms are interleaved by word or longword not just by byte or they could be successive in memory and the memory controller deals with the eight bit data path that each one has i suspect though that they are interleaved to some extent so that bits can be read or written at once this would indicate a byte level interleave i am not confusing this with the new machines longword interleave with two pin simms of the same sort although that seems to be the same sort of idea there you get an essential bit data path ro excuse me to ram instead of just a bit one yes the cpu can t handle it but when writing to successive addresses it speeds something up so dale am i right pin simms are interleaved by bytes allowing the full data bus or as is common with usenet and me in particular am i as clueless as everyone else what conclusion can be drawn from this i m trying to figure out what kind of memory configuration for the lc iii bit datapath would be fastest any ideas thanks jason macdonald jason scott macdonald jsm cornell edu jsm crux cit cornell edu technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic cats exist so that we arthur c clarke may caress the lion

updated keyboard question for the plus i have an old mac plus a couple of years ago i bought a shiney new lc it came with apple s new keyboard with abd ports i replaced it with a mac pro plus extended keyboard which i thoroughly enjoy thank you very much well i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus but there s a little problem the plus uses an rj jack for keyboard input and the new keyboards don t i got an extra adb cable from my local apple dealer they re such nice people but they couldn t tell me the order of the wires there are four wires in the adb cables black white red tan i know one s a ground one gets the serial signal one supplies volts and i forgot what the fourth one does anyway if you hook them up wrong you ll fry a board and i really don t want to do that if any brave souls out there have done this before please e mail your experience directly to me i would greatly appreciate it especially since apple s original keyboard is not ergonomically correct btw i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the correlation between the wires for the rj jack and the adb since it has both but no such luck the connections are soldered inside of little boxes oh well one more thing in case you are thinking that the abd ports on the newer models are different from the connection used on the plus you re right however you can use the telephone cable from the plus and connect the mac pro plus keyboard via its own rj jack in other words this little engineering feat i wish to do is possible it s merely a matter of finding out the correct order omt when i get this to work i definitely will post the solution so others can too thanx for the input tis the blink of an eye tis the draught of a breath from the blossoms of health to the paleness of death from the gilded saloon to the briar in the shroud o why should the spirit of mortal be proud william knox shagberg vm cmp ilstu edu
re iisi clock upgrades i too have been watching the iisi speedup reports and plan to upgrade in the next few weeks the plan i have is to build a small board with a few different crystals on it and to be able to switch between the different speeds using a front pannel switch this way i can get the speed when i want but i can also run at slower stock speeds it i experience any compatability problems with any applications i don t expect to be able to switch clock speeds with the system running but if i can switch without any lock up problems then i could switch to mhz when needed and put it back to idle mhz when not needeed this would further reduce the wear and tear on the cpu even with a heat sink of course i would not want to run the different clock signals through the switch but use a chip or two on the board to select the frequency desired and route it directly to the mother board i haven t started probing around inside my si yet does anyone know the voltage level to power the crystal oscilators thanks tom dickens boeing computer services tpd yak ca boeing com these statements are mine and not boeing s

re adding int hard disk drive to iicx yes it is possible to add a second hard drive to a mac iicx internally this is definitely not a recommended procedure by apple but i have done the equivalent to my cx after upgrading it to a quadra the power supply is still the stock cx s and it was able to power two quantum lps drives a pli scsi accelerator a micron technologies bit video board daystar quickcache new technologies overdrive and meg of ram simultaneously i added a new mount for the drive by attaching angle brackets to the drive tower the internal scsi cable was changed to a longer flat ribbon cable onto which i added an extra connector about midway the final hd was internally terminated and the drive between the motherboard and final hd had its terminator resistor packs removed cooling has not been a problem and no scsi problems occur with either the pli scsi chain or motherboard scsi hooked into the two internal hard drives it works very well for me but proceed cautiously if you wish to do the same

re why does apple give us a confusing message ubs carson u washington edu university bookstore writes bunt student tc umn edu monthian buntan writes does anyone know why apple has an ambiguous message for c regarding fpu in all mac price lists i ve seen every c has the message fpu optional i know from what we ve discussed in this newsgroup that all c have the fpu built in except the configuration why would they be so unclear about this issue in their price list i think this is mostly the fault of the people who write up the literature and price lists being confused themselves since there are two possible processor configurations and one of the them doesn t have an fpu it does seem to be an option even though it really isn t i m planning to buy the c cd pretty soon but i m now getting confused with whether it comes with fpu or not well then allow me to end your confusion the c only come with an lc in the base configuration if you are not getting this configuration then you are getting an fpu why say optional if it s built in good question i have been wondering that since feb th if you get the centris with cd configuration you are getting a mac with a rc processor that has built in math coprocessor support my understanding is that the optional fpu refers to your option of purchasing the centris without fpu or one of the other configurations with fpu this is possible but an option is something that you are supposed to be able to request when you want it what apple has done is given the buyer a choice between configurations and not an option apple does not offer an upgrade from the non fpu system to become an fpu system and it is unclear whether the processor on the non fpu system a lc can be replaced with a rc supplied by another vendor this is not unclear at all in fact apple has included in the roms of those machines with lc s code to recognize the presence of the full s fpu and use it thereby making the upgrade as easy as switching chips you pop the lc out and pop in a full apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the centris which only comes with a non fpu lc processor cannot be upgraded to support an fpu the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot swap one for another again according to apple s memo they did i think i would double check this it has been stated countless times in this newsgroup by two of the centris hardware designers that the lc and the full are pin compatible and that the c can be upgraded to a full hades
re centris math coprocessor option david anthony guevara cup portal com writes sorry if this is a faq i don t normally read comp sys mac hardware i am purchasing a couple of centris s i configured the systems as follows eight mb ram ethernet mb vram math coprocessor option my purchasing agent told me about the math coprocessor option and sent me the apple summary documentation to prove it i ordered the coprocessor option but i m really not sure that we needed it i thought the chip had a math coprocessor built into it has apple had a math coprocessor chip architectured to keep up with the speed of the chip in the centris i am concerned that i may have set up a hardware bottleneck apple has really confused people with this whole thing i think we ll be answering this question for about the next year or so there is no option to get an fpu on a c what you have is a choice of cpus there is the lc that does not have an integrated fpu like the full and is only present in the base model of the c appleusa and there is the full which you get when you order anything other than the base configuration therefore since you have ordered one of the mb versions with on board ethernet models you will not be getting the lc but even if you wanted to have the lc you wouldn t be able to order a c with mb ram on board ethernet and an lc it s not an option also a note to people out there that have c s and c s thinking that there is an optional fpu the class chip cannot recognize an external fpu so there is no socket on the motherboard for a fpu chip and you cannot go out and purchase an fpu on a pds card or something like that the only way to get an fpu in these machines is to replace the lc with a full and if you have a c you will not need to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the lc with the full but if you have a c you do need to have a heat sink hades

full page pb screen hi i am working on a project for my marketing class and i d like to ask your help the assignment is to come up with a product and create a marketing plan for it technical issues are not terribly important at this point well my group s plan is to market a full page monitor for laptop computers it would be a third party product to be installed by authorized repair centers like newer technology s palettebook screen the idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you would get twice the screen height of a normal screen remember technical issues aside in fact by adjusting the fold of the screen and the monitor configuration you could have regular or full height the screen would probably be monochrome the motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very popular among business people business people also commonly use word processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient to see a large portion of the document because of the target users and applications color screens aren t really a neccessity we could hopefully keep the cost between and now please don t write this off as completely ridiculous i really need some constructive feedback so if you would please reply to me via email and let me know if you would consider buying a full page laptop screen how much you would be willing to pay for it any helpful commentaries on the idea also if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it doubtful but who knows please send me some thanks in advance mike

types of sounds mono as far as i can tell all play fine through both speakers system beeps already provided ones such as indigo and ones i record armor alley spectre spaceward ho but the following games only play out of the left channel lemmings out of this world awesome game btw glider oids but still stereo system beeps do play in stereo through both speakers the one i m specifically referrring to is apocolyptic beginning which my roommate downloaded from some ftp site sumex all of the symptoms are the same on my rommates he can t run ootw because he doesn t have color we re both running system does anyone with lemmings or the other three games i mentioned above get sound out of both speakers on a mac ii class quadra lc powerbook or greater centris se etc stereo machine i used to have a mac ii and i sort of rememeber lemmings playing in stereo on that machine not just on the left channel i could be mistaken though if there were a problem with the quad s and pb s i am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo if there isn t a problem with our machines i wonder why the games above are apparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they could just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of both speakers like spectre etc do quadra s and powerbook s have the same roms to my knowledge so maybe this is a rom problem if so though why wouldn t system patch over this problem thanks for any help you can provide in article apr kth se jon wtte d jwa hemul nada kth se writes mac sound hardware is diverse some macs play in stereo and mix the output the se for instance while others play in stereo but only has the left channel for the speaker while some are truly mono like the lc developers know that stuff played in the left channel is guaranteed to be heard while the right channel isn t some send data to both some only send data to the left channel the first is preferrable of course okay i guess its time for a quick explanation of mac sound the original documentation for the sound hardware im documents how to make sound by directly accessing hardware basically you jam values into all the even bytes from soundbase to soundbase x this was because of how the mac and some later machines generated sound was by scanning this block and d aing every even byte the odd bytes went to the floppy on some machines when the mac ii and apple sound chip was invented it was designed to generate stereo sound it was also designed to be compatible with we had once documented so storing bytes at the even values at soundbase meant i want to play a mono sound and so it was emulated but apple had since retracted the documentation on soundbase and decided not to document the lowest layers of sound generation so apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you want to make stereo sound enter game developers the sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games furthermore people who port from the ibm don t want to learn more apis so it has become popular for game writers to write to soundbase to make sound since it is very easy since the mac ii apple has had many different kind of sound output hardware and the only things they have in common are that writing to soundbase works on some hardware mac ii iix iicx iici at least writing to soundbase gets you mono sound through both speakers on some macs quadra at least writing to soundbase gets you mono sound on the left channel only both are technically correct interpretations of the original specification but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons if developers use the sound manager and i think the sound driver mono sounds will typically come out through both channels regardless of the underlying hardware it is possible to specify you want to generate left channel only but no one does if developers write to sound base their games will only come out the left on some games the other problem the original mac ii only producing left channel sound on the internal speaker while the se mixes both isn t really related it is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of the different machines it only affects true stereo sounds sounds which are actually mono will play on the internal speaker no matter what machine you have now to more directly address the question the games you list lemmings out of this world awesome game btw glider oids and also hellcats super tetris oxyd and many more these are just what i ve tested cheat and write to soundbase and so are only left channel on quadras other games you list armor alley spectre spaceward ho and also pga tour golf civilization and more these are again only from personal experience use the sound manager and work fine on all machines the more of the story is to developers don t cheat really i am absolutely positively not allowed to do what i am about to do but i m going say it anyway stop cheating on sound really soon you will be sorry as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware the grace period is about to end the sound manager is understandable now and works pretty well and will work even better soon so use it in conclusion to doug it isn t a hardware problem at least not a bug to jon it isn t a choice to developers as to whether they want to send sound to both channels if they do it the right way it is taken care of automatically if you cheat there is not way to make it work on all hardware have fun disclaimer number i don t work on sound here at apple i m just pretty well informed so don t write me with sound questions disclaimer number if it says up above that i wrote anything like the grace period is about to end then it is a bug in your news feed since i am catagorically not allowed to say anything like that you know what i mean disclaimer number i don t speak for apple just me steve bollinger

chips are not listed years only appear with dead cpus and indicate first to last year used as a cpu cache note both ibm and mac use caches external to the cpus these external caches increase the speed of the cpu but are not a part of it in most of the present macs there are external caches built in while with ibm they are optional though machines are generally sold with them installed since there

drivers video and operating systems in the ibm world intel microsoft and other hardware and software developers are working out plug and play standards pc week color support display mac mhz pixel clock standard all present macs support the use of bit color through bit color quickdraw in rom bit color quickdraw allows an almost transparent capability to display and edit x bit images in y bit color and retain all the colors of y bit color where x and y independently are or regardless of monitor resolution dpi color to dpi palettebook or monitor type including autosynchronous vga mcga and svga monitors with ranges including hz vertically and khz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor macuser aug older machines that supported color se ii iix and iicx had only bit color in rom and needed a software patch to use bit color macuser special to keep costs down and speed up most macs have only or bit display capability built in but most of those can be expanded to display bit color presently quickdraw is optimized for dpi display quickdraw qx will change this in addition quickdraw allows in macs with a nubus slot more then one monitor to be used in any combination from two monitors showing the same thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree of overlap of the pictures vram video ram standard for present non powerbook mac s handling of built in video from a bit color palette vram provided runs a bit color x display expandable to bit color or a bit x display sound output standard in all macs since the k stereo sound became standard with the se ibm even though pcs have rom bios definitions of how the operating system interacts with the video hardware nan zou the use of drivers bypassing bios video hareware inconsitancies see super vga below and nonstanderzation of clone bios have left resolution of video display hardware os and program interaction up to the os and video hardware in question faisal nameer jawdat in addition ibm and clone makers never bothered to provide a standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is actually present matt healy nor a standardized screen drawing toolbox like mac s qd as a result the os must be very well written to detect some modes especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly at present things are so dependent on the interaction of the program os print driver and monitor card that editing bit pictures regardless of color mode os and monitor type card combination as one can do on the mac is impossible with an ibm for example one cannot edit a bit color picture done on a os with a svga monitor on a with vga bit color palette and dos and still have all the colors one started out with later ibm machines will have integrated graphics accelerators faster processors and modular upgradeability and may have built in sound cards cd rom and ethernet pc week mda monocrome display adapter original character mapped video mode no graphics x text cga color graphics array x colors or x b w color palette bad for the eyes ega enhanced graphics array x colors from color palette and some lower res some versions could run at colors bearable on the eyes vga video graphics array x at colors x at colors and some others these two are the most commonly used all modes have a k clut from a to bit ibm or a bit mac color palette mhz pixel clock mel martinez monitors use analog input incompatible with ttl signals from ega cga etc mcga multi color graphics array subset of vga that provides all the features of mda cga but lacks some ega and vga modes like vga x x dictionary of computer terms dct common on the initial ps implementation from ibm and some ps models svga super vga this is not a standard in the way the others were but instead was a catch all category for a group of video cards as such with each manufacturer using their own implementation scheme svga was chaos with people debating as to what is svga and what is not in an effort to make svga more of a standard vesa was established and is used in the newer units but things are still a mess video is either k or m today resolution of x and x at and colors are common newer ones since have the sierra hicolor ramdac giving bit colors at x some of the very newer ones can do bits per pixel usually at x speedwise too much variation some very slow western digital paradise based for example some very fast s c based for example some are so so like tseng et a very popular chipset some limiting factors overcome by mhz vl bus s linear address mapping were mhz isa bus at architecture where the cpu looks at the card through a k window etc other non svga standards a ibm s own standard interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions like linedraw polygon fill etc in hardware some clone implementations from ati are the fastest video available today though some clone models do not have interlacing tms high end graphics co processors usually some do bit speeds up vector oriented graphics like cad xga extended graphics array newer and faster than a only available for mca bus based ps s clones are coming out soon emulates vga ega and cga dct max resolution at x x b same as a also some bpp modes xga accelerates graphics functions up to times faster than standard vga in windows and os including line draws bit and pixel block transfers area fills masking and x y addressing has an intelligent way to detect and co exist with other xga cards so multiple desktops like on the mac may not be far away since this is an architecture its resolution and color depth isn t fixed ibm implements only bit color while other companies can have bit color through ibm technical licenses refresh rates up to hz ensures flicker free rock solid images to reduce visual discomfort and is vga compatible up to x on os some monitor types usable by mac see mac section above for specific details expansion both mac ibm scsi only external device expansion interface common to both mac and ibm allows the use of any device hard drive printer scanner nubus card expansion mac plus only some monitors and cd rom main problem there are a lot of external devices which are internal terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the scsi port a scsi chain is supposed to be terminated only at the begining and at the end any other set up causes problems for either mac or ibm scsi devices per scsi controller bit asynchronous mb s ave and synchronous mb s max transfers difference is due to scsi software drivers fast scsi is a misname for bit scsi in scsi mode see scsi for details scsi devices per scsi controller in scsi mode scsi is fully scsi compliant and bit scsi tends to be implemented as a very fast scsi since it does not require the different controller interfaces in hardware and software that and bit scsi do transfer speeds are mb s with mb s burst bit mb s with mb s burst bit and mb s with mb s burst bit wide and fast since bit scsi can use scsi software drivers and hardware at bit scsi speeds and as such is limited to devices sometimes it is mistakenly called fast scsi bit fast scsi requires a scsi software driver and scsi electronics but can still use the scsi ports wide bit and bit scsi require a different scsi port electronics and software driver from scsi which makes them more expensive than other scsi interfaces mac scsi asynchronous scsi built in standard since the plus even though apple developed some specifications for scsi controlers the os scsi manager needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both scsi interfaces as a result present scsi macs use bit scsi as a fast asynchronous scsi presently quadras are the only macs with a scsi controller chip built in digital review oct v n p though they lack some other parts of the hardware like the wide scsi port interface since other macs require a nubus card to use scsi older nubus macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the nubus and cpu rumor some cyclone macs june will come with a wide fast scsi port standard and have a rewritten os scsi manager ibm scsi scsi is not too wide spread yet generally not bundled with systems except as add on eisa and vesa local bus adapters avalable like the mac bit scsi is used as a very fast scsi by most controllers out there unlike the mac ibm has no exact scsi controller specifications which results in added incompatibilities for scsi mac memory expansion with a few exceptions the mac has used non parity pin bit simm memory expansion since the plus while pin bit parity simms could be used in these macs only special iicis could make use of the parity feature by convension both simm types are called pin simms the iifx used pin parity simms the lc iii c and q all use a new pin simm that is accessable by bits at a time and is used in ibms the mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing reading every memory location if something is seriously wrong with a simm the mac will not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is since macs made before feb managed memory baced on data path simms had to be installed in pairs bit or in sets of bit the centris and quadra eliminate this with a new memory management setup that allows memory to be upgraded one simm at a time if the simms are the same size are used then the memory is interleaved across the two simms resulting in a performance boost on ram access macworld apr printers adbs and modems built in interfaces standard monitor interface and

throughput mb s burst mode mb s future card designs will be instead of the old quickring a peer to peer bus used in parallel with nubus apple s vlbus architecture is identical to that of vlbus byte burst mode mb s byte in development cpu expansion handled either through the pds or the nubus unlike pds nubus cpu cards example radius rocket allow use of multiple processors at the same time this is like having two or more macs in the same box able to dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved each nubus card needs its own memory but most nubus cards of this type come with mb ram simms on the card standard ibm memory expansion parity simms non parity simms some newer models do a mac like simm memory check or a dozen or so different types of memory boards hd interfaces limited to hard drives by design or lack of development mfm modified frequency modulation rll run length limited only used with smaller mb hard drives ide integrated device electronics asynchronous mb s max and synchronous mb s max transfer currently the most common standard and is mainly used for medium sized drives can have more than one hard drive esdi enhanced small device interface mb s throughput generally considered better interface than scsi in many ways but not common enough for practical consideration outside of hard drives device choices are very limited compared to scsi bus interfaces new plug and play isa and eisa compatable cards may have problems working with old cards infoworld pc week vaporware isa bit interfaces common has bit data path limit which produces a mb limit for which there are software workarounds pc mag mb s byte uses edge triggered interrupts can t share them hence comes the irq conflict limited busmastering capabilities some cards

intel s version of local bus that is intended to totally replace isa eisa mca in development oses assumes full installation print drivers fonts multifinder etc and multiple application use mac k to mb of os and hardware commands have been put into rom this allows apple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the mac os quickdraw menu commands print mouse scsi sound drivers etc in rom which require clone makers to use the rom chip or read rom on to disks which requires access to the proper mac since different macs have slightly different rom chips plus vs classic for example with key hooks for the os support interface in rom programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk os has the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and therefore can write smaller programs this also allows apple greater control over hardware software standards and that the disk os can be smaller and with some of the tookbox command code in rom with lower ram requirements then a totally disk based os macs use masked rom which is as fast as dram jon wtte single program usage base requirements mb and dd floppy cooperatively multitasking base requirements mb

older machines requires the mode extension apple s last free os with worldscript support speedier and less ram usage than dot macweek pc week to run in bit mode on older machines it requires the mode or bit enabler extension marks the start of apple saling its mac os instead of allowing free upgrades bundled with new machines for x upgrades otherwise the installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system fonts from the previous system inside the system file this can eat up any ram benefits and cause other problems apple itself recommends removing all fonts from the system file a ux unix needs mb ram mb suggested mb hard drive and a or equivalent to run this bit preemptive multitasking os is large due to being unix and needing translators between it and the mac roms price note sound output was supported in oses to by many formats including the following snd wave asnd fssd qssn smsd soun dc d and dcfl in the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards snd and aiff which causes some playback problems for the old formats though most still play ibm machiness have little gui code data and hooks present in hardware for programmers to work with so most of the coding must be provided in the os since hard disks were slow the disk os code is read into ram in addition what little rom code there is also read into ram a process called shadow rom this results in faster implementation since ram is faster then proms or eproms having most of the os code on disk has the advantage of being able to better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which is harder with a rom based system due to the patches needed in addition it reduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware support is needed side note the ftc charged that microsoft formed a os trust by not providing all feature documentation for its oses to developers outside ms and designing its windows and dos apps to fail under os undocumented windows and there is deliberate code in windows nt beta which causes the install to abort if os boot manager is present gregory hicks info ibmpc digest v due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the ftc judicial council for action against microsoft was a tie which resulted in no action rumors the ftc will presue the matter likely to the point of choosing a new member or whole new council in addition the government has turned down microsoft s copyright of windows which would allow it to charge a fee for developers using their hooks pc week microsoft oses dos has a k barrier

section for details os number crunching mel park mac arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment sane or standard apple numerics environment floating point numbers are bits long when an fpu is present and bits otherwise exceptions such as dividing by zero or taking the square root of a negative number do not cause an abort but are handled in a logically consistent manner produces the internal representation for infinity inf produces zero the above treatment of occurs in an fpu equipped machine even when sane is bypassed and the fpu programmed directly ibm floating point numbers are bits with a hardware fpu bits when emulated the way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever compiler or assembler was used for a program on older dos complilers exceptions could cause program aborts and would abort to the dos prompt at the point where they occured most present compilers handle this better result there is little consistent handling of numbers between dos windows and os programs nor between programs for just one os networking includes printing wysiwyg printing can be a problem with either mac of ibm machines especially if one sends truetype fonts to a older style postscript printer mac hardware built in localtalk network port and a built in printer port localtalk has moderate speeds kb s requires special connectors for each machine and up and can be run off of either the printer port to include very old macs or the network port standard today built in ethernet is becoming common but many older macs require a pds or nubus card at about for each machine these cards provide three connectors and transceivers thick thin and baset for ethernet the macintosh quadra family and some centris models includes ethernet interface on motherboard with transceivers available tokenring has been a network option since software appletalk the suite of protocols standard with mac os which can use variety of media types appleshare client software included with the os as well and can connect to file servers such as novell netware com open banyan vines dec pathworks apple s appleshare servers system file sharing machines and afp servers running on variety of unix hosts mactcp allows typical tcp ip communications telnet ftp nfs rlogin a later version will have unix x open transport interface xti built in by the end of macweek third party software to connect to nfs servers dec pathworks provides decnet support peer to peer file sharing software built in to system see os section full server software is extra printing requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in the chooser changing printers is by selecting a different name in the chooser the same is true of connecting to servers printing bugs monaco truetype font is different then the screen bitmap font quickdraw qx is suppossed to fix this and similar problems ibm hardware localtalk not widely used ethernet and tokenring software novell netware banyan vines decnet windows work groups appletalk protocols and appleshare subset of appletalk each of the ms dos networking schemes are in general totally incompatible with the others once you have chosen one you are pretty much locked in to that product line from then on windows work groups is a little more forgiving and removes some of this problem novell netware is the biggest percent of the corporate market and in general is more powerful and offers better control management security than appleshare but it s also more complex to set up and manage this will change due to the use of the mac finder and file management system by novell pc week infoworld dec macweek printing very os dependent dos if it s a single user then you plug the printer into the parallel port and don t worry about it tweeking may be needed with poorly written software network printing is not controlled by the system but is mostly implemented by the actual program therefore performance varies from one software program to the next windows x supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing jobs in the print queue but it always lists printers as active even if they are not this becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers on the same net because there s no way for software to reliably determine which printer is active right now windows for workgroups is more mac like and intelligent about this os mac like the os deals with printers with apps making calls to the os printing bugs due to poor programing some programs for all the above oses do not have wysiwyg printing this is the fault of the programs in question and not that of the os involved price issue this is very dynamic with mac providing more build in features than ibm and ibm being more get only what you need then mac and price wars by both worlds the ibm machines modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware standarization which in turn requires oses and programs to be very complex to handle all the variation in hardware when one adds all the standard mac hardware features to an ibm built in input output sound support scsi pds built in monitor support built in networking standard mouse interface and nubus in higher machines the mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent equipted ibm machine especially since some ibm monitors can be used with macs which cuts some more of the

serial line connection between duo and pc in article almaden ibm com petrack vnet ibm com writes i have tried almost everything under the sun to get a null modem connection between a mac duo and a pc i have used mackermit and versaterm on the mac side i have used procomm kermit and softerm on os on the pc or ps side i have used non hardware handshaking and hardware ahdshaking cables and know my hands are shaking from the effort nothing has allowed file transfers from the mac to the ps could i hear from someone attesting that they can really pump information out the serial port of a duo fast like via a modem or via a sys ex dump could anyone with a duo help me out i am going absolutely insane i wanna know if the problem is my duo or all duo s or all duos or just me hmmm sounds vaguely similar to a problem i had a long time ago when i was trying to use kermit i was building a serial connection between my duo and my next i think the problem was in the handshaking basically you need to make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides a safe place to start is by selecting no handshaking on either end one problem is that the zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it wrong and only a reset will clear it i don t know the specifics but this could be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system it could very well be that you are doing things right eventually but one wrong move like trying a bad handshaking protocol can screw up any further correct actions until the next machine reset i have wedged my mac and also my next that way now i can send files back and forth between the duo and the next without any problem and at pretty high speeds too i don t know what kind of chip the pc uses but i think the zilog is pretty standard hope this helps avery

re quadra scsi problems attention mac quadra owners many storage industry experts have concluded that mac quadras suffer from timing irregularities deviating from the standard scsi specification this results in silent corruption of data when used with some devices including ultra modern devices although i will not name the devices since it is not their fault an example would be a sony inch mo without the special mac compatible firmware installed one solution sometimes is to disable blind writes to the best of my knowledge there aren t any problems with quadras and blind transfers trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer screwed up the tibs or didn t test their driver with the device in question well designed tibs poll or loop at every point where delays of sec occur this usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some devices can hiccup in the middle of blocks if this happens in the middle of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte depending on which direction the tranfer was going in anycase the scsi manager will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because it is out of sync actual data loss would only occur if the driver didn t pay attention to the errors coming back note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the scsi bus but rather by the transfer loops inside the scsi manager the problem occurs when the processor bus errors trying to access the scsi chip when the next byte hasn t been clocked yet also note that the bus error is dealt with by a bus error handler and doesn t crash the machine clinton bauder apple computer

should be viewed as hints and suggestions x entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are x allowed even so you are safer if you remain within the guidelines x x you should read the current ioccc rules prior to submitting entries x the rules are typically sent out with these guidelines x x xwhat is new in x x the entry format is better for us anyway the program mkentry c x has been updated see entry format x x we will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ansi c x compiler certain old obfuscation hacks that cause ansi c compilers x fits are no longer permitted some of the new issues deal with x non integral array types variable number of arguments c preprocessor x directives and the exit function see our likes and dislikes x x xhints and suggestions x x you are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests see x for more information for details on how to get previous winners x x keep in mind that rules change from year to year so some winning entries x may not be valid entries this year what was unique and novel one year x might be old the next year x x an entry is usually examined in a number of ways we typically apply x a number of tests to an entry x x look at the original source x convert ansi tri graphs to ascii x c pre process the source ignoring include lines x c pre process the source ignoring define and include lines x run it through a c beautifier x examine the algorithm x lint it x compile it x execute it x x you should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests x you should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been x cleaned up by the c pre processor and a c beautifier x x your entry need not do well under all or in most tests in certain x cases a test is not important entries that compete for the x strangest most creative source layout need not do as well as x others in terms of their algorithm on the other hand given x two such entries we are more inclined to pick the entry that x does something interesting when you run it x x we try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules as such we leave x the contest open for creative rule interpretation as in real life x programming interpreting a requirements document or a customer request x is important for this reason we often award worst abuse of the x rules to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way x x if you do plan to abuse the rules we suggest that you let us know x in the remarks section please note that an invitation to abuse x is not an invitation to break we are strict when it comes to the x byte size limit also abusing the entry format tends to x annoy more than amuse x x we do realize that there are holes in the rules and invite entries x to attempt to exploit them we will award worst abuse of the rules x and then plug the hole next year even so we will attempt to use x the smallest plug needed if not smaller x x check out your program and be sure that it works we sometimes make x the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem particularly x in or near the final round on the other hand we have seen some x of the best entries fall down because they didn t work x x we tend to look down on a prime number printer that claims that x is a prime number if you do have a bug you are better off x documenting it noting this entry sometimes prints the th power x of a prime by mistake would save the above entry and sometimes x a strange bug feature can even help the entry of course a correctly x working entry is best x x xour likes and dislikes x x doing masses of defines to obscure the source has become old we x tend to see thru masses of defines due to our pre processor tests x that we apply simply abusing defines or dfoo bar won t go as far x as a program that is more well rounded in confusion x x many ansi c compilers dislike the following code and so do we x x define d define x d foo don t expect this to turn into define foo x x int i x j don t use such implicit type declaration x int k x x we suggest that you compile your entry with an ansi c compiler if you x must use non ansi c such as k r c you must avoid areas that result in x compile link errors for ansi c compilers x x unfortunately ansi c requires array indexes to be of integral type x thus the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed x x int i x char c x i c use c i instead x i string use string i instead x x if your entry uses functions that have a variable number of x arguments be careful systems implement va list as a wide variety x of ways because of this a number of operations using va list are x not portable and must not be used x x assigning a non va list variable to from a va list variable x casting a non va list variable into from a va list variable x passing a va list variable to a function expecting a non va list arg x passing a non va list variable to a function expecting a va list arg x performing arithmetic on va list variables x using va list as a structure or union x x in particular do not treat va list variables as if they were a char s x x avoid using varargs h use stdarg h instead x x if you use c preprocessor directives define if ifdef x the leading must be the first character on a line while some x c preprocessors allow whitespace the leading many do not x x because the exit function returns void on some systems entries x must not assume that it returns an int x x small programs are best when they are short obscure and concise x while such programs are not as complex as other winners they do x serve a useful purpose they are often the only program that people x attempt to completely understand for this reason we look for x programs that are compact and are instructional x x one line programs should be short one line programs say around x bytes long getting close to bytes is a bit too long in our opinion x x we tend to dislike programs that x x are very hardware specific x are very os or un x version specific x index strchr differences are ok but socket streams specific x code is likely not to be x dump core or have compiler warnings x it is ok only if you warn us in the remark header item x won t compile under both bsd or sys v un x x abusing the build file to get around the size limit x obfuscate by excessive use of ansi tri graphs x are longer than they need to be x are similar to previous winners x are identical to previous losers x x unless you are cramped for space or unless you are entering the x best one liner category we suggest that you format your program x in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines x x the build file should not be used to try and get around the size x limit it is one thing to make use of a several d s to help out x but it is quite another to use bytes of d s in order to x try and squeeze the source under the size limit you should feel x free to make use of the build file space but you are better off x if you show some amount of restraint x x we allowed whitespace and in certain cases or do not impact x your program size up to a certain point because we want to get x away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters x x given two versions of the same program one that is a compact blob x of code and the other that is formatted more like a typical c x program we tend to favor the second version of course a third x version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting x and or obfuscated way would definitely win over the first two x x we suggest that you avoid trying for the smallest self replicating x program we are amazed at the many different sizes that claim x to be the smallest there is nothing wrong with self replicating x programs in fact a number of winners have been self replicating x you might want to avoid the claim of smallest lest we or others x know of a smaller one x x x client entries should be as portable as possible entries that x adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored don t x depend on a particular type of display for example don t depend x on color or a given size don t require backing store x x x client entries should avoid using x related libraries and x software that is not in wide spread use we ask that such x client x entries restrict themselves to only the low level xlib and the x athena widget set libx a libxaw a libxmu a and libxt a x don t use m tif xv ew or openl ok toolkits since not everyone x has them avoid depending on a particular window manager not x everyone has x r and some people are stuck back in x r or x earlier so try to target x r without requiring x r better x yet try to make your entry run on all version x window systems x x x client entries should not to depend on particular items on x xdefaults if you must do so be sure to note the required lines x in the remark section x x we like programs that x x are as concise and small as they need to be x do something at least quasi interesting x pass lint without complaint not a requirement but it is nice x are portable x are unique or novel in their obfuscation style x make use of a number of different types of obfuscation x make us laugh and or throw up x x some types of programs can t excel in some areas of course your x program doesn t have to excel in all areas but doing well in several x areas really does help x x we freely admit that interesting creative or humorous comments in x the remark section helps your chance of winning if you had to x read of many twisted entries you too would enjoy a good laugh or two x we think the readers of the contest winners do as well x x be creative x x xentry format x x in order to help us process the many entries we must request your x assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way this format x in addition allows us to quickly separate information about the x author from the program itself see judging process x x we have provided the program mkentry as an example of how to x format entries you should be aware of the following warning that x is found in mkentry c x x this program attempts to implement the ioccc rules every x attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces x an entry that conforms to the contest rules in all cases x where this program differs from the contest rules the x contest rules will be used be sure to check with the x contest rules before submitting an entry x x you are not required to use mkentry it is convenient however x as it attempts to uuencode the needed files and attempt to check x the entry against the size rules x x if you have any suggestions comments fixes or complaints about x the mkentry c program please send email to the judges see below x x the following is a sample entry x x entry xrule xfix n xtitle chonglab xentry xdate mon mar xhost un x v pdp x bsd pdp x remark x this is a non obfuscated obfuscated c program x x it is likely not to win a prize but what do you expect from x a short example x

xaddr toad hall x po box x san francisco california x x usa xemail hoptoad sun lab x lab sun com xanon n x info x xend x build xbegin build x v o ryc uo r v x xend x program xend x end x x typically the build file should assume that the source is prog c x and will compile into prog if an entry wins we will rename x its source and binary to avoid filename collision by tradition x we use the name of the entry s title followed by an optional x digit in case of name conflicts x x if the above entry somehow won the least likely to win award x we would use chonglab c and chonglab x x if your entry depends on or requires that your build source x and or binary files be a particular name please say so in the x remark section if this case applies it would be be helpful x if you did one of the following x x tell us how to change the filename s in your entry x x have the build file make copies of the files for example x x cc prog c o special name need special binary x x or rm f special src c need special source x cp prog c special src c x cc special src c o special name x x or rm f special build need special build x tail build special build x sh special build x x assume that we will use the entry title send us a version of x your build program files that uses the name convention you x should uuencode these files in data sections x x if your entry needs to modify its source info or binary files x please say so in the remark section you should try to avoid x touching your original build source and binary files you should x arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify this x will allow people to re generate your entry from scratch x x remember that your entry may be built without a build file we x typically incorporate the build lines into a makefile if the x build file must exist say so in the remark section x x if your entry needs special info files you should uuencode them x into info sections in the case of multiple info files x use multiple info sections if no info files are needed x then skip the info section x x info files are intended to be input or detailed information that x does not fit well into the remark section for example an x entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample x programs for the user to compile an entry might want to include a x lengthy design document that might not be appropriate for a x hints file x x info files should be used only to supplement your entry for x example info files may provide sample input or detailed x information about your entry because they are supplemental x the entry should not require them exist x x in some cases your info files might be renamed to avoid name x conflicts if info files should not be renamed for some reason x say so in the remark section x x info files must uudecode into the current directory if they x absolutely must be renamed or moved into a sub directory say x so in the remark section x x when submitting multiple entries be sure that each entry has x a unique entry number from to your first entry should x have entry number x x with the exception of the header all text outside of the entry x format may be ignored that is don t place text outside of the x entry and expect the judges to see it our decoding tools aren t x ai progs if you need tell the the something put it in the x remark section or send a email to the judges at x x apple pyramid sun uunet hoptoad judges not the address for x judges toad com submitting entries x x the date should be given with respect to utc some systems refer x to this as gmt or gmt the format of the date should be that as x returned by asctime in the c locale an example of such a string is x x thr apr x x this format is similar to the output of the date command the x string does not include the timezone name before the year on many x systems one of the following command will produce a similar string x x date u a h d t y x date u sed e s x sh c tz utc date sed e s x sh c tz gmt date sed e s x sh c tz gmt date sed e s x x you are allowed to update fix revise your entry to do so set x the fix line in the entry section to y instead of n x be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number x as well as these are used to determine which entry is to be x replaced x x xjudging process x x entries are judged by larry bassel and landon curt noll x x entries are unpacked into individual directories the email message x is unpacked into individual files each containing x x entry section x all author sections x all info sections x build section x program section x any other text including the email message headers x x prior to judging the any other text file is scanned to be sure x it does not contain useful information or in case the entry was x malformed and did not unpack correctly information from the x author sections are not read until the judging process is x complete and then only from entries that have won an award x x the above process helps keep us biased for against any one particular x individual we are usually kept in the dark as much as you are x until the final awards are given we like the surprise of finding x out in the end who won and where they were from x x we attempt to keep all entries anonymous unless they win an award x because the main prize of winning is being announced we make all x attempts to send non winners into oblivion we remove all non winning x files and shred all related paper by tradition we do not even x reveal the number of entries that we received for the curious x we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the ioccc x winners at talks x x after the usenix announcement we attempt to send email to the x authors of the winning entries one reason we do this is to give x the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their x entry they are given the chance to correct mistakes typos we x often accept their suggestions comments about our remarks as well x this is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world x x judging consists of a number of elimination rounds during a round x the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles x the pile that advances on to the next round and the pile that does x not we also re examine the entries that were eliminated in the x previous round thus an entry gets at least two readings x x a reading consists of a number of actions x x reading the entry section x reading the uudecoded build section x reading the uudecoded program section x reading the uudecoded info section s if any x passing the source thru the c pre processor x shipping over any include files x performing a number of c beautify cleanup edits on the source x passing the beautified source thru the c pre processor x shipping over any include files x x in later rounds other actions are performed x x linting the source x compiling building the source x running the program x performing misc tests on the source and binary x x until we reduce the stack of entries down to about entries entries x are judged on an individual basis an entry is set aside because it x does not in our opinion meet the standard established by the round x when the number of entries thins to about entries we begin to form x award categories entries begin to compete with each other for awards x an entry often will compete in several categories x x the actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries x we receive a typical category list might be x x best small one line program x best small program x strangest most creative source layout x most useful obfuscated program x best game that is obfuscated x most creatively obfuscated program x most deceptive c code x best x client see our likes and dislikes x best abuse of ansi c x worst abuse of the rules x anything else so strange that it deserves an award x x we do not limit ourselves to this list for example a few entries are so x good bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round x we will invent awards categories for them if necessary x x in the final round process we perform the difficult tasks of x reducing the remaining entries typically about down to or x winners often we are confident that the entries that make it into x the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not x make it the selection of the winners out of the final round is x less clear cut x x sometimes a final round entry good enough to win but is beat out x by a similar but slightly better entry for this reason it is x sometimes worthwhile to re enter an improved version of an entry x that failed to win in a previous year this assumes of course x that the entry is worth improving in the first place x x more often that not we select a small entry usually one line a x strange creative layout entry and an entry that abuses the contest x rules in some way x x in the end we traditionally pick one entry as best sometimes such x an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry more often the x best is picked because it does well in a number of categories x x xannouncement of winners x x the first announcement occurs at a summer usenix conference by tradition x this is done during the latter part of the uunet ioccc bof just prior to x the berkeley bsd and bsdi bof x x winning entries will be posted in late june to the

the above ii what is xfree and where do i get it what is xfree xfree is an enhanced version of x which was distributed with x r this release consists of many bug fixes speed improvements and other enhancements here are the highlights of the enhancements the speedup package from glenn lai is an integral part of xfree selectable at run time via the xconfig file some speedups require an et based svga and others require a virtual screen width of the speedups suitable to the configuration are selected by default with a high quality et board vram this can yield up to improvement of the xstones benchmark over x the fx packages from jim tsillas are included as the default operating mode if speedup is not selected this mode is now equivalent in performance to x b x r and approximately faster than x support for localconn compile time selectable for server clients or both this support is for both svr and svr for svr with the advanced compatibility package local connections from sco xsight odt clients are supported drivers for ati and trident tvga c and tvga svga chipsets refer to the files readme ati and readme trident for details about the ati and trident drivers support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added thomas eberhardt s code from the contrib directory on export lcs mit edu type font code from mit contrib tape has been included and is compile time selectable there are contributed type fonts in the contrib directory on export lcs mit edu new configuration method which allows the server s drivers and font renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary distributions integrated support for bsd mach and linux a monochrome version of the server which will run on generic vga cards is now included the following key features were added with the release of xfree they were not in xfree the monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank switching of available svga memory to allow virtual screens up to x see the x manual page for more information support for the hercules mono card has been added to the monochrome server and with it the ability to support a two headed server one vga and one hercules so far this has only been tested on svr it is also reported to work under linux svr shared libraries tested under isc svr and support for svr there are some special considerations to consider due to new usl bugs see the readme svr file for more information support for ps mice and logitech mouseman trackman some versions of these devices were not previously compatible a new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor timing data written by eric raymond derived from previous documentation and a lot of experimentation greatly improved support for international keyboards including implementation of the compose key functionality found on many vendor servers see the x keybd manual page for more information the accuracy with which the server detects svga pixel clocks has been improved and the timings are now stored at accuracies of mhz users may want to consider removing an existing clocks line from their xconfig file and re probing using the new server many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the xconfig configuration file error messages are much more informative and intuitive and more validation is done there are many new options that can be enabled in the xconfig file see the x manual page for more information on the format of this file plus a number of other small things refer to the changelog file in the source distribution for full details also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by eric raymond and the current x mode database and a sample xdm configuration by david wexelblat what oss are supported xfree supports svr consensys v svr microport dell esix isc at t mst consensys uhc svr isc at t linux mach bsd bsd is not supported but it should work the most active bsd person is greg lehey grog lemis de note that esix d and sco are not supported yet but anyone should feel free to submit patches if you are interested in tackling this send mail to xfree physics su oz au what video hardware is supported at this time xfree supports the following svga chipsets tseng et tseng et paradise pvga western digital wd c wd c wd c these are supersets of the pvga and use its driver genoa gvga trident tvga c tvga ati all of the above are supported in both color and monochrome modes with the exception of the ati chipsets which are only supported in color mode the monochrome server also supports generic vga cards using k of video memory in a single bank and the hercules card on the et only k of video memory is supported for the monochrome server and the gvga has not been tested with more than k it appears that some of the svga card manufacturers are going to non traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel clock frequencies to avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes xfree adds support for using an external program to select the pixel clock this allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are discovered refer to the readme clkprog file for information on how these programs work if you need to write one if you do develop such a program the xfree team would be interested in including it with future xfree releases if you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using xfree it is suggested that you purchase an et based board such as the orchid prodesigner iis avoid recent diamond boards xfree will not work with them because diamond won t provide programming details in fact the xfree project is actively not supporting new diamond products as long as such policies remain in effect contributions of code will not be accepted because of the potential liabilities if you would like to see this change tell diamond about it some people have asked if xfree would work with local bus or eisa video cards theoretically the means of communication between the cpu and the video card is irrelevant to xfree compatibility it could be isa eisa or local bus what should matter is the chipset on the video card unfortunately the developers don t have a lot of access to eisa or vlb machines so this is largely an untested theory however we have yet to see any reports of things not working on one of these buses and we have several reports of xfree working fine on them what about accelerated boards at this time there is no support in xfree for accelerated boards like the s ati ultra a tiga etc this support is available in commercial products from sgcs and metrolink for svr and svr an s server is available for bsd and linux contact hasty netcom com for bsd or jon robots ox ac uk for linux a beta a server is available for linux contact martin cs unc edu or jon robots ox ac uk note these servers are not part of xfree why doesn t xfree support color vga modes the reason that this is not supported is the way vga implements the color modes in color modes each byte of frame buffer memory contains pixel but the color modes are implemented as bit planes each byte of frame buffer memory contains bit from each of each of pixels and there are four such planes the mit frame buffer code is not designed to deal with this if vga handled color modes by packing bit pixels into each byte the mit code could be modified to support this or it already may i m not sure but for the vga way of doing things a complete new frame buffer implementation is required some beta testers are looking into this but nothing is yet available from the project what other hardware or software requirements are there obviously a supported svga board and os are required to run x efficiently mb of memory should be considered a minimum the various binary releases take mb of disk space depending on the os e g whether or not it supports shared libraries to build from sources at least mb of free disk space will be required although mb should be considered a comfortable lower bound where can i get source for xfree source patches for the current version based on x r pl from mit are available via anonymous ftp from export lcs mit edu under contrib xfree ftp physics su oz au under xfree ftp win tue nl under

may archive older releases as well each binary distribution will contain a readme file that describes what files you need to take from the archive and which compile time option selections were made when building the distribution iv what general things should i know about running xfree installation directories the top level installation directory is specified by the projectroot usr x by default variable in config site def binaries include files and libraries are installed in projectroot bin include lib this can be changed when rebuilding from sources and can be modified via symbolic links for those oss that support them this directory is nonstandard and was chosen this way to allow xfree to be installed alongside a commercial vendor supplied x implementation configuration files the xfree server reads a configuration file xconfig on startup the search path contents and syntax for this file are documented in the server manpage which should be consulted before asking questions determining vga dot clocks and monitor modes david e wexelblat dwex mtgzfs att com maintains a database of known clock settings for vga cards and monitor settings the database is installed in usr x lib x etc modedb txt and is in the source tree under mit server ddx x etc this database is also available from him for the latest copy and is kept on export lcs mit edu in contrib x modedb z which is updated occasionally obtain a copy of this database it just might have the settings you need if you create new settings please send them to david for inclusion in the database if this doesn t help you the videomodes doc by eric raymond file with xfree contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings it may be helpful to start with settings that almost work and use this description to get them right when you do send the information to david wexelblat for inclusion in the database note the old clock exe program is not supported any more and is completely unnecessary if you need to determine dot clock values for a new board remove the clocks line from your xconfig file if present and start the server the server will probe for clocks itself and print them out you can use these values to put a clocks line into your xconfig file which is not necessary but will speed up starting the server in the future rebuilding reconfiguring the server from the link kit if you have installed the server binary link kit it is possible to reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server this is fully explained in the readme file that is available with the link kit v what os specific things should i know about running xfree first of all the server must be installed suid root mode svr why won t my xterm run properly if your kernel is not built with the consem module you should define consem no in you environment otherwise xterm won t run csh users should use setenv consem no the esix console driver patch is known to cause keymapping problems with xfree it recommended that this patch not be installed alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap svr make sure you look at ftp readme isc if that s what you are running bsd make sure you look at ftp readme bsd also a separate bsd faq is maintained by richard murphey rich rice edu the latest version should be available in the file xfree bsd faq at the following ftp sites agate berkeley edu pub bsd ports xfree wuarchive wustl edu mirrors bsd ports xfree grasp univ lyon fr pub bsd ports xfree linux you must be running linux pl or greater and have the gcc jump libraries installed make sure the binaries x x mono xload and xterm are setuid root if your kernel doesn t have tcp support compiled in you ll have to run the server as x pn the default startup configuration assumes that tcp is not available if it is change the two files usr x bin startx and usr x lib x xdm xservers removing the pn argument to x make sure dev console is either a link to dev tty or has the major number minor number also note that if dev console is not owned by the user running x then xconsole and xterm will not permit console output redirection xdm will properly change the owner but startx won t when running xdm from rc local you will need to provide it with a tty for example xdm dev console for more detailed information please read the file readme present with the distribution on tsx mit edu mach make sure you look at ftp readme mach vi what things should i know for building xfree from source this section has been removed from the faq since it is fully explained in ftp readme and the os specific readmes please look at those files for information on building xfree vii is there anything special about building clients with xfree bsd compatibility library a lot of clients make use of bsd functions like bcopy etc the default configuration files are set up to link with libxbsd a which contains emulation for bcopy bzero bcmp ffs random seed a better way of providing the b functions is to include x xfuncs h in source files that call them xfuncs h provides macro definitions for these in terms of the sysv mem functions if you are linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these functions then you should link with libxbsd a ansiccoptions this is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the ansi ness defined in the default ccoptions without having to rewrite the entire ccoptions line for example with stock mit you d see something like ccoptions ansi o fwritable strings and to get rid of the ansi ness the developer would have to put ccoptions o fwritable strings in his imakefile with this change you would see a default of ansiccoptions ansi ccoptions o fwritable strings and all the developer would have to put in the imakefile is ansiccoptions to get rid of the ansi ness many x clients will die a horrible death with ansi the effect is even more dramatic in practice because ccoptions is actually quite complex the other issue is that one must add ansiccoptions ansiccoptions to a passcdebugflags definition xfree contact information ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the xfree core team at this time the core team consists

glossary o the xt intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to c code to allow useful graphical components to be created included with this are classes that provide the base functionality object rectobj core composite constraint shell overrideshell wmshell etc the terms xt and intrinsics are used interchangeably however they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the x window system in particular it does not include the athena motif olit or any other widget set without further widgets the intrinsics are not especially useful o a widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via xt the precise use is any object that is a subclass of the core class it is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the object class although these are more accurately called windowless widgets or gadgets o xlib is the c interface to the x protocol it is one layer below the xt intrinsics typically a widget uses relatively few xlib functions because xt provides most such services although an understanding of xlib helps with problems software versions the following are the latest versions of xt based software software version released next expected x

motif peter ware ware cis ohio state edu posts an faq list for comp windows x intrinsics it is on export in contrib faq xt why does my application core dump when i use signals alarms cthreads in brief xlib xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for critical sections any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of the above libraries in an inconsistent state such as all the appropriate flags not yet set dangling pointers in the middle of a list traversal etc note that the ansi c standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal itself so this is not a problem specific to xlib and xt the posix specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by xlib or xt functions the only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the interrupt handler this flag later needs to be checked either by a work procedure or a timeout callback it is incorrect to add either of these in the interrupt handler as another note it is dangerous to add a work procedure that never finishes this effectively preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never be called another option is to open a pipe tell the event loop about the read end using xtappaddinput and then the signal handler can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal however this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up why don t the intrinsics deal with this problem primarily because it is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating system is that a good enough reason i don t think so note the article in the x journal and the example in o reilly volume are in error how do i use a different visual than the default this requires a more complicated answer than it should a window has three things that are visual specific the visual colormap and border pixmap all widgets have their own colormap and borderpixmap resource only shell widgets have visual resources another questions deals with why shells have a visual the default value of these resources is copyfromparent which does exactly what it says in the shell widget copyfromparent gets evalulated as defaultvisualofscreen and defaultcolormapofscreen when any one of the three resources is not properly set a badmatch error occurs when the window is created they are not properly set because each of the values depends on the visual being used how to get this to work there are two parts to the answer the first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application to start with a different visual the second is actually easier because the basic information you need is available the first is a little harder because you ll need to initialize much of the toolkit yourself in order to determine the needed information some sample code to start up an application using something other than the default visual to compile cc g visual c o visual lxaw lxmu lxt lxext lx lm to run visual geometry x depth visual staticcolor fg blue bg yellow

applicationshellwidgetclass dpy args cnt display the application and loop handling all events xtrealizewidget top xtappmainloop app return which visual should an application use this is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is no way for an application to know the appropriate visual it has to be specified by the user if you disagree with this then your application probably falls into the category of always using the default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular visual such as bit truecolor with an overlayplane extension or some such why no application runs in isolation depending on the way a server allocates resources i may not always want your application to run in truecolor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications i may be very upset if it chooses to run in greyscale instead of psuedocolor or just monochrome as an example on a low end color sun server there are many different possible visuals monochrome entry colormap static gray static color and a truecolor the sgi iris s offer all the above plus bit truecolor bit truecolor an overlay plane why do only shell widgets have a visual this is strictly by convention it makes it possible for an arbitrary widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that shell a widget can have its own visual resource if it does it must have its own realize method to use the visual when it calls xcreatewindow you should also make this a resource that can be obtained with xtgetvalues so other widgets can find it a reasonable value is probably xtnvisual which visual depth and colormap do shells inherit the default value for these resources are set to copyfromparent this is interpreted as the defaultcolormapofscreen defaultdepthofscreen and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent i e it is an applicationshellwidgetclass and the root of your widget tree if the parent of the widget is not null then the shell copies colormap and depth from its parent and uses copyfromparent as the visual i ve done all the above and i still get a badmatch error why some resource converters improperly cache references this was especially true of x r and earlier versions of motif why doesn t my widget get destroyed when i call xtdestroywidget see section of the xt specification it eventually does get destroyed just not immediately the intrinsics destroy a widget in a two phase process first it and all of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed it is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed this way any pending x events or further references to that widget can be cleaned up before the memory is actually freed the second phase is then performed after all callbacks event handlers and actions have completed before checking for the next x event at this point the list is traversed and each widget s memory is actually free d among other things as some further caveats trivia the widgets may be destroyed if the intrinsics determine that they have no further references to the widgets on the list if so then the phase destruction occurs immediately also if nested event loops are used widgets placed on the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not destroyed until returning to the outer event loop how do i exit but still execute the destroycallbacks the problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting an application is used such as calling exit directly then a widget may not have a chance to clean up any external state such as open sockets temporary files allocated x resources etc this code for simplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget widget toplevelget gw widget gw widget to find toplevel widget top for top gw xtparent top top xtparent top empty return top void exitcallback gw closure call data widget gw widget xtpointer closure data the app specified xtpointer call data widget specific data widget toplevel toplevel toplevelget gw xtunmapwidget toplevel make it disappear quickly xtdestroywidget toplevel exit one can see that the above code exit s immediately after destroying the toplevel widget the trouble is the phase destruction may never occur this works for most widgets and most applications but will not work for those widgets that have any external state you might think that since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant of the implementation details for each widget which means that the widget may change and someday require that some external state is cleaned up by the destroy callbacks one alternative is to modify exitcallback to set a global flag and then test for that flag in a private event loop however private event loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy and difficult to maintain practices try the following code instead include x intrinsic h extern widget toplevelget if needfunctionprototypes widget gw endif extern boolean exitworkproc if needfunctionprototypes xtpointer closure endif extern void

xtunmapwidget toplevel make it disappear quickly xtdestroywidget toplevel xtappaddworkproc xtwidgettoapplicationcontext gw exitworkproc xtpointer null boolean exitworkproc closure xtpointer closure exit notreached exitcallback adds a work procedure that will get called when the application is next idle which happens after all the events are processed and the destroy callbacks are executed how do i resize a shell widget after it is realized one doesn t resize a shell widget the proper thing is to resize the currently managed child of the shell widget using xtsetvalues the geometry change is then propagated to the shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the request however the shell must have the resource xtnallowshellresize set to true otherwise it will not even ask the window manager to grant the request and the shell will not resize to change the position of a shell use xtsetvalues on the shell not the child and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted why can t xtappaddinput handle files it does however unix semantics for when i o is ready for a file does not fit most peoples intuitive model in unix terms a file descriptor is ready for reading whenever the read call would not block ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to block this works as expected for terminals sockets and pipes for a file the read will always return but the return indicates an eof i e no more data the result is the code in the intrinsics always calls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to be read the culprit is the select system call or on sysv based os s it is the poll system call how to get around this on a unix system the best approach is to use another process to check for available input on the file use a pipe to connect the application with this other process and pass the file descriptor from the pipe to xtappaddinput a suitable program on bsd systems is tail f filename it s rumored that select on some systems is not completely reliable in particular ibm aix this is one where it would work for a while several thousand times and then stop until some other event woke it up this seemed to be the result of a race condition in the kernel ibm claims to have a fix for this pyramid doesn t work at all ultrix and possibly others where pipes are implemented as sockets wasn t completely broken but although the writing side wrote in byte blocks the reading side received it all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at a time you can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks get raound it by detecting the situation and having select ignore the pipe for mseconds by then it had been given the whole block note that all the above descriptions used unix terminology such as read file descriptor pipes etc this is an os dependent area and may not be identical on all systems however the intrinsic designers felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with part of the toolkit why they didn t also deal with signals at this point i don t know what good books and magazines are there on xt i have a favorite that is the definitive reference to my perspective it offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full details of the intrinsics when i started using it i was already familiar with xt and the concepts behind it

an xt reference done in manual page style the rd edition is extensively overhauled and goes far beyond the mit manual pages i m finding it very useful in particular the permutted index and references to other manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related information i read two periodicals the x resource and the the x journal these are the only two dealing specifically with x the x

much i like c and admire the skill in both designing and implementing the intrinsics hopefully some alternative will develop in the next years that uses an object oriented language keep your eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language other than c starts gaining acceptance how do i pass a float value to xtsetvalues first what is going wrong is the structure for an arg is essentially typdef struct string name long value arg and the code arg arg xtsetarg arg name expands to arg arg arg name name arg value you can see that with normal c type conversions the arg value gets the integer instead of the floating point value when the value is copied into the widget resource the bit pattern is wildly different than that required for a floating point value so how to get around this the following macro is from the athena widgets document and i am now recomending it over the previous suggestions define xtsetfloatarg arg n d if sizeof float sizeof xtargval xtsetarg arg n d else xtargval ld xtargval d xtsetarg arg n ld how do i write a resource converter courtesy of rich thomson rthomson dsd es com the following discussion of resource converters assumes r or r intrinsics resource converters changed between r and r to allow for destructors and caching of converted values there are several main types of resource converters string to data type data type to string data type to data type i string to data type usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings that will be converted to data type values this is most often used to map enumerated names to enumerated values name value true false in this case the string to data type converter needs to compare the resource value to the list of fixed strings this is most readily accomplished by the use of the quark mechanism of the resource manager the resource value is turned into a quark which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a single word then the resource quark is compared against the quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values if there are many enumerated strings in the converter or many converters each with a small number of enumeration strings then a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the resource strings into quarks that way the first time one of these converters is used the strings will be turned into quarks and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one of the converters ii data type to string this type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data type converters since the use of quarks isn t necessary instead the data type value is simply converted to a string value probably by the use of sprintf data type to string converters are useful for applications that wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that they can write out a valid resource specification to a file this mechanism can be used to provide a snapshot of application state into a file this snapshot can be used to restore the program to a known state via the usual x resource database mechanisms if you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type converter it isn t much extra effort to write the data type to string converter writing both at the same time helps to ensure that they are consistent iii data type to data type this type of converter is used to convert an existing data type value to another data type for instance an x pixel value can be converted to an rgb data type that contains separate fields for red green and blue the type signature for a resource converter is as follows typedef boolean xttypeconverter display xrmvalueptr cardinal xrmvalueptr xrmvalueptr xtpointer display dpy xrmvalueptr args cardinal num args xrmvalueptr fromval xrmvalueptr toval xtpointer converter data when the converter is invoked the fromval argument points to the source x resource manager value and the toval argument points to the destination x resource manager value the converter data argument is an opaque pointer to some converter specific data that is specified when the converter is registered the args and num args arguments allow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is invoked for instance the pixel to rgb structure converter discussed above would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the pixel to obtain the rgb values corresponding to that pixel care must be taken with the toval argument an xrmvalue has the following type definition and specifies a size and location for a converted value typedef struct unsigned int size caddr t addr xrmvalue xrmvalueptr when the converter is invoked the address may point to a location of the given size for the converted value or the location can be null in the former case the converter should ensure that the size of the destination area is large enough to handle the converted value if the destination area is not large enough then the converter should set the size to the amount of space needed and return false the caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the converter if the size is large enough then the converter can simply copy the converted value into the space given and return true if the location is null then the converter can assign the location to the address of a static variable containing the converted value and return true when writing a group of converters this code is often repeated and it becomes convenient to define a macro define done var type if toval addr if toval size sizeof type toval size sizeof type return false else type toval addr var else toval addr caddr t var toval size sizeof type return true define donestr str if toval addr toval size sizeof string toval size sizeof string return false else toval addr caddr t str toval size sizeof string return true inside the converter it is a good idea to perform a little safety checking on the num args and args arguments to ensure that your converter is being called properly once you have written your converter you need to register it with the intrinsics the intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating widgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database to register a converter with a single application context use xtappsettypeconverter void xtappsettypeconverter context from to converter args num args cache destructor xtappcontext context string from string to xttypeconverter converter xtconvertarglist args cardinal num args xtcachetype cache xtdestructor destructor to register a converter with all application contexts use xtsettypeconverter void xtsettypeconverter from to converter args num args cache destructor string from string to xttypeconverter converter xtconvertarglist args cardinal num args xtcachetype cache xtdestructor destructor in the r intrinsics there were the routines xtappaddconverter and xtaddconverter these have been superseded by xtappsettypeconverter and xtsettypeconverter whenever possible the newer routines should be used when a converter is registered with the intrinsics a cache argument specifies how converted resource values are to be cached xtcachenone don t cache any converted values xtcacheall cache all converted values xtcachebydisplay cache converted values on a per display basis caching converted values that require a round trip to the server is a good idea for instance string to pixel conversions the destructor argument is a routine that is invoked then the resource is destroyed either because its cached reference count has been decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is being destroyed xtdestructor has the following type definition typedef void xtdestructor xtappcontext xrmvalueptr xtpointer xrmvalueptr cardinal xtappcontext context xrmvalueptr to xtpointer converter data xrmvalueptr args cardinal num args the destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated with the to argument but does not actually free the storage pointed to by the to argument itself to addr the destructor is passed the extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the conversion was performed for instance colormap and visual arguments for the string to pixel converter since the destructor would need to free the allocated pixel from the colormap as well as the private data passed in when the converter was registered sample converter code can be found in the following files in the mit r distribution mit lib xt converters c contrib lib pext converters c contrib lib pext converters h how do i open multiple displays see multi user application software using xt the x resource issue summer by oliver jones for a complete coverage of the issues involved most of this answer is based on that article in a nutshell one uses xtopendisplay to add each display to a single application context and then xtclosedisplay to shutdown each display and remove it from the application context the real problems occur when trying to close down a display this can happen ways user selects a quit button on one of the displays user has window manager send a wm delete window message server disconnect possibly from a killclient message server shutdown crash or network failure i ll assume you can deal gracefully with since it is merely a problem of translating a widget to a display and removing that display if not then read the oliver jones article the third one is difficult to handle the following is based on the oliver jones article and i include it here because it is a difficult problem the difficulty arises because the xlib design presumed that an i o error is always unrecoverable and so fatal this is essentially true for a single display x based application but not true for a multiple display program or an application that does things other than display information on an x server when an x i o error occurs the i o error handler is called and if it returns then an exit happens the only way around this is to use setjmp longjmp to avoid returning to the i o error handler the following code fragment demonstrates this include setjmp h jmp buf xiorecover void xiohandler dpy display dpy destroydisplay dpy longjmp xiorecover main if setjmp xiorecover xsetioerrorhandler xiohandler xtappmainloop app context the destroydisplay is something that given a display pointer can go back to the application specific data and perform any necessary cleanup it should also call xtclosedisplay for those of you unfamiliar with setjmp longjmp when setjmp is first called it returns a and save s enough information in the jmp buf that a latter execution of longjmp can return the program to the same state as if the setjmp was just executed the return value of this second setjmp is the value of the second argument to longjmp there are several caveats about using these but for this purpose it is adequate some other problems you might run into are resource converters that improperly cache resources the most likely symptoms are xlib errors such as badcolor badatom or badfont there may be problems with the total number of displays you can open since typically only a limited number of file descriptors are available with being a typical value you may also run into authorization problems when trying to connect to a display there was much discussion in comp windows x about this topic in november of robert scheifler posted an article which basically said this is the way it will be and xlib will not change what changed from r to r to r this

following places from highest priority to lowest priority args passed at creation time command line arguments user s per host defaults file user s defaults file user s per application default file system wide per application default file note that are read only once on application startup the result of steps is a single resource database used for further queries the per host defaults file contains customizations for all applications executing on a specific computer this file is either specified with the xenvironment environment variable or if that is not set then the file home xdefaults host is used the user defaults file is either obtained from the resource manager property on the root window of the display or if that is not set then the file home xdefaults is used typically the program xrdb is used to set the resource manager property please note that this should be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the display must transfer the property a size of around kbyte is reasonable some toolkits may track changes to the resource manager but most do not a user may have many per application default files containing customizations specific to each application the intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found the system wide per application default files are typically found in usr lib x app defaults if such a file is not found then the fallback resources are used the intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found thanks to oliver jones oj pictel com for the following you can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your xt based programs xfilesearchpath xuserfilesearchpath and xapplresdir these environment variables control where xt looks for application defaults files as an application is initializing xt loads at most one app defaults file from the path defined in xfilesearchpath and another from the path defined in xuserfilesearchpath set xfilesearchpath if software is installed on your system in such a way that app defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies suppose for example that you are running sun s open windows and you also have some r x applications installed in usr lib x app defaults you could set a value like this for xfilesearchpath and it would cause xt to look up app defaults files in both usr lib x and usr openwin lib or wherever your openwinhome is located setenv xfilesearchpath usr lib x t n openwinhome lib t n the value of this environment variable is a colon separated list of pathnames the pathnames contain replacement characters as follows see xtresolvepathname n the value of the filename parameter or the application s class name t the value of the file type in this case the literal string app defaults c customization resource r only s suffix none for app defaults l language locale and codeset e g ja jp euc l language part of l e g ja t the territory part of the display s language string c the codeset part of the display s language string let s take apart the example suppose the application s class name is myterm also suppose open windows is installed in usr openwin notice the example omits locale specific lookup usr lib x t n means usr lib x app defaults myterm openwinhome lib t n means usr openwin lib app defaults myterm as the application initializes xt tries to open both of the above app defaults files in the order shown as soon as it finds one it reads it and uses it and stops looking for others the effect of this path is to search first in usr lib x then in usr openwin let s consider another example this time let s set xuserfilesearchpath so it looks for the file myterm ad in the current working directory then for myterm in the directory app defaults setenv xuserfilesearchpath n ad home app defaults n the first path in the list expands to myterm ad the second expands to home app defaults myterm this is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the imake convention of naming the app defaults file myterm ad in the application s source directory so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly note when looking for app default files with xuserfilesearchpath for some bizarre reason neither the type nor file suffix is defined so t and s are useless with r there s another twist you may specify a customization resource value for example you might run the myterm application like this myterm xrm customization color if one of your pathname specifications had the value usr lib x app defaults n c then the expanded pathname would be usr lib x app defaults myterm color because the c substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource the default xfilesearchpath compiled into xt is usr lib x l t n c r usr lib x l t n c r usr lib x t n c r usr lib x l t n usr lib x l t n usr lib x t n note some sites replace usr lib x with a projectroot in this batch of default settings the default xuserfilesearchpath also compiled into xt is root l n c r root l n c r root n c r root l n root l n root n root is either the value of xapplresdir or the user s home directory if xapplresdir is not set if you set xuserfilesearchpath to some value other than the default xt ignores xapplresdir altogether notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app defaults file in your current working directory is to set xapplresdir to a single dot in r all this machinery worked differently for r compatibilty many people set their xapplresdir value to a dot followed by a slash what order are callbacks executed in courtesy of donna converse converse expo lcs mit edu the intrinsics library do not guarantee an order this is because both the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to modify the entire contents of the callback list neither one currently knows what the other is doing and so the intrinsics cannot guarantee the order of execution the application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer the widget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and remove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have therefore the functionality contained in a callback should be independent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the list even though the xt standard in the definition of xtaddcallback says callback name specifies the callback list to which the procedure is to be appended you may not infer from the word appended that the callback routines are called in the same order as they have been added to the callback list how do i know if a widget is visible courtesy of donna converse converse expo lcs mit edu i am building a widget needs to know if it is visible i set the visible interest field in core and if my window is completely obscured the core visible flag goes false however if my window is iconified the flag stays set to true right everything is implemented correctly this demonstrates a deficiency in the x protocol and the core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the protocol the deficiency is that the information is available in one way in this case an inconvenient way the xt specification is accurate in the second and third paragraphs of section so read this section carefully the visible field will not change in response to iconification a visibilitynotify event will not be received when the window goes from viewable to unviewable that is when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped that is when iconification occurs this is the protocol deficiency visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the x protocol see the glossary in your xlib and x protocol reference manual is this a problem with mwm or is there something else which needs to be done you ll see this with any window manager with no window manager if the problem is mwm what is the fastest way to determine if a window is iconified as an application writer keep track with a global boolean in an action routine with translations for mapnotify and unmapnotify on the shell widget which contains your custom widget as the custom widget writer see the map state field returned by a call to xgetwindowattributes these are suggestions how do i reparent a widget in xt i e xtreparentwidget you can t why use xtmalloc xtfree etc unfortunately most code that calls malloc realloc or calloc tends to ignore the possibility of returning null at best it is handled something like ptr type malloc sizeof type if ptr perror malloc in xyzzy exit to handle this common case the intrinsics define the functions xtmalloc xtcalloc xtnew xtnewstring and xtrealloc which all use the standard c language functions malloc calloc and realloc but execute xterrormsg if a null value is returned xt error handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits in addition if xtrealloc is called with a null pointer it uses xtmalloc to get the initial space this allows code like if ptr ptr type malloc sizeof type else ptr type realloc ptr sizeof type count count to be written as ptr xtrealloc ptr sizeof ptr count also xtfree accepts a null pointer as an argument generally i ve found the xt functions conveniant to use however anytime i m allocating anything potentially large i use the standard functions so i can fully recover from not enough memory errors xtnew and xtnewstring are conveniant macros for allocating a structure or copying a string struct abc xyzzy char ptr char str abcdef xyzzy xtnew struct abc takes care of type casting ptr xtnewstring str a strict interpretation of the intrinsics reference manual allow an implementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with malloc and free i e code such as char ptr ptr xtmalloc free ptr may not work personally i d call any implementation that did this broken and complain to the vendor a common error for motif programmers is to use xtfree on a string when they should really be using xmstringfree how to debug an xt application first i d recomend getting purify from pure software this is a great package for tracing memory problems on sun s it s a bit pricey at but i d still recomend it excuse the marketing blurb contact support pure com for more info purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into the object code produced by existing compilers these instructions check every memory read and write performed by the program under test and detect several types of access errors such as reading unitialized memory writing past malloc d bounds or writing to freed memory purify inserts checking logic into all of the code in a program including third party and vendor object code libraries and verifies system call interfaces in addition purify tracks memory usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel adaption of garbage collection techniques purify s nearly comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program down typically by a factor of two to five an alternative package that isn t as pricey for a sun runs on many unix s and has pretty similar features is the sentinel debugging environment this replaces malloc and several other c library functions to add additional checks contact cpcahil virtech vti com for more info next if you are getting any sort of xlib error you ll need to run in synchronous mode easily accomplished with the sync command line argument or by setting the variable xdebug to with your debugger then set a break point in exit this will let you trace back to the original xlib function being called if you don t run in synchronous mode then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to xlib previously since the xlib calls are buffered and replies from the server are asynchronous next if you are having trouble with window layout you can use the undocumented resource xtidentifywindows or the class resource xtdebug to cause the widget name to be identified with each window for example example xload xrm xtdebug true example xwininfo tree click in new xload window will give the normal information but the widget name and class of each window is included this can help for checking the location and size of errant widgets next if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to test the way a widget manages it s children you can try export lcs mit edu contrib libxtgeo tar z this acts as a filter between any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour of both it s a very clever idea the most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the application is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse such as from a pulldown menu the server effectively locks up and you ll need to go to another machine and kill the debugger manually the server locks up because the application being debugged has said no one else can have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped waiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands unfortunately you can t give them because all the input is going to your application which is stopped the best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on your desk running the program under a debugger or other environment on one machine and running the application on the other possibly using a command sequence like this othermachine xhost thismachine thismachine setenv display othermachine thismachine gdb application your favorite debugger or this othermachine xhost thismachine thismachine gdb application gdb set environment display othermachine gdb run i believe codecenter a c interpreter graphical debugger has a method of dealing with this by explicitely calling the xlib functions to release any grabs during breakpoints debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and knowledge of how widgets work you can go a long way without knowing the internals of a particular widget but not very far without understanding how a widget works judicious use of conditional breakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great deal why don t xtaddinput xtaddtimeout and xtaddworkproc work i have got a delicate problem with the three routines xtaddinput xtaddtimeout and xtaddworkproc the problem i have is that when i use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly i have made a handy little testprogram where everything works perfect but in my real application nothing happens the introduction in r of the xtapp functions obsoleted those routines see q for other changes in r r and r what happens is they use a default application context different then the one you may have created since events and timeouts are distributed on a per application context basis and you are using two application contexts you won t get those events for example cnt toplevel xtappinitialize app class desc xtnumber desc argc argv fallback args cnt xtaddtimeout xtaddworkproc xtappmainloop app would never invoke the timeout what is and how can i implement drag and drop courtesy of roger reynolds rogerr netcom com feb drag n drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients in an intuitive fashion motif version supports drag n drop capabilities openlook has supported d n d all along the two protocols are not compatable with each other and so far as i know they are not published i wrote a package called rdd which is designed to be a flexible public protocol for doing drag n drop operations between clients my intention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to support a standard drag n drop protocol in the programs they develop and contribute or sell regardless of what widget set is used as long as it is based on xt the implementation is based upon my understanding of the icccm conventions for more details read the code i have heard from dozens of people using rdd who like it and feel that it works a whole lot better than motif stuff also there seem to be many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use motif anyway the latest rdd and some other stuff is available for ftp from netcom com in pub rogerr a possibly older version is also available on

strange exposure problem hi i m trying to write a motif program on an interactive unix machine and i m observing very strange behavior when my program attempts to expose a drawingarea namely some xlib operations work and some do not in particular the expose consist of two xfillrectangle calls followed by some xdrawpoint calls and for reasons unknown to me the point calls are failing whenever a pulldown or popup up menu is clicked on and moved in the rightward direction over the drawing area but after the move is still on some part of the drawing area this also happens less consistently when the pulldown popup is moved in the leftward direction assuming that my code is not doing anything incredibly odd is this a server bug thanks zack t smith

though it does contain comments about x them the guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions x entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are x allowed even so you are safer if you remain within the guidelines x x you should read the current ioccc rules prior to submitting entries x the rules are typically sent out with these guidelines x x changes from the draft are noted by change bars x x xwhat is new in x x the entry format is better for us anyway the program mkentry c x has been updated see entry format x x we will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ansi c x compiler certain old obfuscation hacks that cause ansi c compilers x fits are no longer permitted some of the new issues deal with x non integral array types variable number of arguments c preprocessor x directives and the exit function see our likes and dislikes x x xhints and suggestions x x you are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests see x for more information for details on how to get previous winners x x keep in mind that rules change from year to year so some winning entries x may not be valid entries this year what was unique and novel one year x might be old the next year x x an entry is usually examined in a number of ways we typically apply x a number of tests to an entry x x look at the original source x convert ansi tri graphs to ascii x c pre process the source ignoring include lines x c pre process the source ignoring define and include lines x run it through a c beautifier x examine the algorithm x lint it x compile it x execute it x x you should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests x you should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been x cleaned up by the c pre processor and a c beautifier x x your entry need not do well under all or in most tests in certain x cases a test is not important entries that compete for the x strangest most creative source layout need not do as well as x others in terms of their algorithm on the other hand given x two such entries we are more inclined to pick the entry that x does something interesting when you run it x x we try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules as such we leave x the contest open for creative rule interpretation as in real life x programming interpreting a requirements document or a customer request x is important for this reason we often award worst abuse of the x rules to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way x x if you do plan to abuse the rules we suggest that you let us know x in the remarks section please note that an invitation to abuse x is not an invitation to break we are strict when it comes to the x byte size limit also abusing the entry format tends to x annoy more than amuse x x we do realize that there are holes in the rules and invite entries x to attempt to exploit them we will award worst abuse of the rules x and then plug the hole next year even so we will attempt to use x the smallest plug needed if not smaller x x check out your program and be sure that it works we sometimes make x the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem particularly x in or near the final round on the other hand we have seen some x of the best entries fall down because they didn t work x x we tend to look down on a prime number printer that claims that x is a prime number if you do have a bug you are better off x documenting it noting this entry sometimes prints the th power x of a prime by mistake would save the above entry and sometimes x a strange bug feature can even help the entry of course a correctly x working entry is best x x xour likes and dislikes x x doing masses of defines to obscure the source has become old we x tend to see thru masses of defines due to our pre processor tests x that we apply simply abusing defines or dfoo bar won t go as far x as a program that is more well rounded in confusion x x many ansi c compilers dislike the following code and so do we x x define d define x d foo don t expect this to turn into define foo x x int i x j don t use such implicit type declaration x int k x x we suggest that you compile your entry with an ansi c compiler if you x must use non ansi c such as k r c you must avoid areas that result in x compile link errors for ansi c compilers x x unfortunately some ansi c compilers require array indexes to be of x integral type thus the following classical obfuscation hacks should x not be used in this rule may be relaxed in future contests x x int i x char c x i c use c i instead x i string use string i instead x x if your entry uses functions that have a variable number of x arguments be careful systems implement va list as a wide variety x of ways because of this a number of operations using va list are x not portable and must not be used x x assigning a non va list variable to from a va list variable x casting a non va list variable into from a va list variable x passing a va list variable to a function expecting a non va list arg x passing a non va list variable to a function expecting a va list arg x performing arithmetic on va list variables x using va list as a structure or union x x in particular do not treat va list variables as if they were a char s x x avoid using varargs h use stdarg h instead x x if you use c preprocessor directives define if ifdef x the leading must be the first character on a line while some x c preprocessors allow whitespace the leading many do not x x because the exit function returns void on some systems entries x must not assume that it returns an int x x small programs are best when they are short obscure and concise x while such programs are not as complex as other winners they do x serve a useful purpose they are often the only program that people x attempt to completely understand for this reason we look for x programs that are compact and are instructional x x one line programs should be short one line programs say around x bytes long getting close to bytes is a bit too long in our opinion x x we tend to dislike programs that x x are very hardware specific x are very os or un x version specific x index strchr differences are ok but socket streams specific x code is likely not to be x dump core or have compiler warnings x it is ok only if you warn us in the remark header item x won t compile under both bsd or sys v un x x abusing the build file to get around the size limit x obfuscate by excessive use of ansi tri graphs x are longer than they need to be x are similar to previous winners x are identical to previous losers x x unless you are cramped for space or unless you are entering the x best one liner category we suggest that you format your program x in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines x x the build file should not be used to try and get around the size x limit it is one thing to make use of a several d s to help out x but it is quite another to use bytes of d s in order to x try and squeeze the source under the size limit you should feel x free to make use of the build file space but you are better off x if you show some amount of restraint x x we allowed whitespace and in certain cases or do not impact x your program size up to a certain point because we want to get x away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters x x given two versions of the same program one that is a compact blob x of code and the other that is formatted more like a typical c x program we tend to favor the second version of course a third x version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting x and or obfuscated way would definitely win over the first two x x we suggest that you avoid trying for the smallest self replicating x program we are amazed at the many different sizes that claim x to be the smallest there is nothing wrong with self replicating x programs in fact a number of winners have been self replicating x you might want to avoid the claim of smallest lest we or others x know of a smaller one x x x client entries should be as portable as possible entries that x adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored don t x depend on a particular type of display for example don t depend x on color or a given size don t require backing store x x x client entries should avoid using x related libraries and x software that is not in wide spread use we ask that such x client x entries restrict themselves to only the low level xlib and the x athena widget set libx a libxaw a libxmu a and libxt a x don t use m tif xv ew or openl ok toolkits since not everyone x has them avoid depending on a particular window manager not x everyone has x r and some people are stuck back in x r or x earlier so try to target x r without requiring x r better x yet try to make your entry run on all version x window systems x x x client entries should not to depend on particular items on x xdefaults if you must do so be sure to note the required lines x in the remark section x x we like programs that x x are as concise and small as they need to be x do something at least quasi interesting x pass lint without complaint not a requirement but it is nice x are portable x are unique or novel in their obfuscation style x make use of a number of different types of obfuscation x make us laugh and or throw up x x some types of programs can t excel in some areas of course your x program doesn t have to excel in all areas but doing well in several x areas really does help x x we freely admit that interesting creative or humorous comments in x the remark section helps your chance of winning if you had to x read of many twisted entries you too would enjoy a good laugh or two x we think the readers of the contest winners do as well x x be creative x x xentry format x x in order to help us process the many entries we must request your x assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way this format x in addition allows us to quickly separate information about the x author from the program itself see judging process x x we have provided the program mkentry as an example of how to x format entries you should be aware of the following warning that x is found in mkentry c x x this program attempts to implement the ioccc rules every x attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces x an entry that conforms to the contest rules in all cases x where this program differs from the contest rules the x contest rules will be used be sure to check with the x contest rules before submitting an entry x x you are not required to use mkentry it is convenient however x as it attempts to uuencode the needed files and attempt to check x the entry against the size rules x x if you have any suggestions comments fixes or complaints about x the mkentry c program please send email to the judges see below x x the following is a sample entry x x entry xrule xfix n xtitle chonglab xentry xdate mon mar xhost un x v pdp x bsd pdp x remark x this is a non obfuscated obfuscated c program x x it is likely not to win a prize but what do you expect from x a short example x author xname landon curt noll xorg ioccc judging group xaddr toad hall x po box x san francisco california x x usa xemail chongo toad com xanon n x author xname larry bassel xorg ioccc judging group xaddr toad hall x po box x san francisco california x x usa xemail hoptoad sun lab x lab sun com xanon n x info x end x x typically the build file should assume that the source is prog c x and will compile into prog if an entry wins we will rename x its source and binary to avoid filename collision by tradition x we use the name of the entry s title followed by an optional x digit in case of name conflicts x x if the above entry somehow won the least likely to win award x we would use chonglab c and chonglab x x if your entry depends on or requires that your build source x and or binary files be a particular name please say so in the x remark section if this case applies it would be be helpful x if you did one of the following x x tell us how to change the filename s in your entry x x have the build file make copies of the files for example x x cc prog c o special name need special binary x x or rm f special src c need special source x cp prog c special src c x cc special src c o special name x x or rm f special build need special build x tail build special build x sh special build x x assume that we will use the entry title send us a version of x your build program files that uses the name convention you x should uuencode these files in data sections x x if your entry needs to modify its source info or binary files x please say so in the remark section you should try to avoid x touching your original build source and binary files you should x arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify this x will allow people to re generate your entry from scratch x x remember that your entry may be built without a build file we x typically incorporate the build lines into a makefile if the x build file must exist say so in the remark section x x if your entry needs special info files you should uuencode them x into info sections in the case of multiple info files x use multiple info sections if no info files are needed x then skip the info section x x info files are intended to be input or detailed information that x does not fit well into the remark section for example an x entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample x programs for the user to compile an entry might want to include a x lengthy design document that might not be appropriate for a x hints file x x info files should be used only to supplement your entry for x example info files may provide sample input or detailed x information about your entry because they are supplemental x the entry should not require them exist x x in some cases your info files might be renamed to avoid name x conflicts if info files should not be renamed for some reason x say so in the remark section x x info files must uudecode into the current directory if they x absolutely must be renamed or moved into a sub directory say x so in the remark section x x when submitting multiple entries be sure that each entry has x a unique entry number from to your first entry should x have entry number x x with the exception of the header all text outside of the entry x format may be ignored that is don t place text outside of the x entry and expect the judges to see it our decoding tools aren t x ai progs if you need tell the the something put it in the x remark section or send a email to the judges at x x apple pyramid sun uunet hoptoad judges not the address for x judges toad com submitting entries x x the date should be given with respect to utc some systems refer x to this as gmt or gmt the format of the date should be that as x returned by asctime in the c locale an example of such a string is x x thr apr x x this format is similar to the output of the date command the x string does not include the timezone name before the year on many x systems one of the following command will produce a similar string x x date u a h d t y x date u sed e s x sh c tz utc date sed e s x sh c tz gmt date sed e s x sh c tz gmt date sed e s x x you are allowed to update fix revise your entry to do so set x the fix line in the entry section to y instead of n x be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number x as well as these are used to determine which entry is to be x replaced x x xjudging process x x entries are judged by larry bassel and landon curt noll x x entries are unpacked into individual directories the email message x is unpacked into individual files each containing x x entry section x all author sections x all info sections x build section x program section x any other text including the email message headers x x prior to judging the any other text file is scanned to be sure x it does not contain useful information or in case the entry was x malformed and did not unpack correctly information from the x author sections are not read until the judging process is x complete and then only from entries that have won an award x x the above process helps keep us biased for against any one particular x individual we are usually kept in the dark as much as you are x until the final awards are given we like the surprise of finding x out in the end who won and where they were from x x we attempt to keep all entries anonymous unless they win an award x because the main prize of winning is being announced we make all x attempts to send non winners into oblivion we remove all non winning x files and shred all related paper by tradition we do not even x reveal the number of entries that we received for the curious x we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the ioccc x winners at talks x x after the usenix announcement we attempt to send email to the x authors of the winning entries one reason we do this is to give x the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their x entry they are given the chance to correct mistakes typos we x often accept their suggestions comments about our remarks as well x this is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world x x judging consists of a number of elimination rounds during a round x the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles x the pile that advances on to the next round and the pile that does x not we also re examine the entries that were eliminated in the x previous round thus an entry gets at least two readings x x a reading consists of a number of actions x x reading the entry section x reading the uudecoded build section x reading the uudecoded program section x reading the uudecoded info section s if any x passing the source thru the c pre processor x shipping over any include files x performing a number of c beautify cleanup edits on the source x passing the beautified source thru the c pre processor x shipping over any include files x x in later rounds other actions are performed x x linting the source x compiling building the source x running the program x performing misc tests on the source and binary x x until we reduce the stack of entries down to about entries entries x are judged on an individual basis an entry is set aside because it x does not in our opinion meet the standard established by the round x when the number of entries thins to about entries we begin to form x award categories entries begin to compete with each other for awards x an entry often will compete in several categories x x the actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries x we receive a typical category list might be x x best small one line program x best small program x strangest most creative source layout x most useful obfuscated program x best game that is obfuscated x most creatively obfuscated program x most deceptive c code x best x client see our likes and dislikes x best abuse of ansi c x worst abuse of the rules x anything else so strange that it deserves an award x x we do not limit ourselves to this list for example a few entries are so x good bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round x we will invent awards categories for them if necessary x x in the final round process we perform the difficult tasks of x reducing the remaining entries typically about down to or x winners often we are confident that the entries that make it into x the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not x make it the selection of the winners out of the final round is x less clear cut x x sometimes a final round entry good enough to win but is beat out x by a similar but slightly better entry for this reason it is x sometimes worthwhile to re enter an improved version of an entry x that failed to win in a previous year this assumes of course x that the entry is worth improving in the first place x x more often that not we select a small entry usually one line a x strange creative layout entry and an entry that abuses the contest x rules in some way x x in the end we traditionally pick one entry as best sometimes such x an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry more often the x best is picked because it does well in a number of categories x x xannouncement of winners x x the first announcement occurs at a summer usenix conference by tradition x this is done during the latter part of the uunet ioccc bof just prior to x the berkeley bsd and bsdi bof x x winning entries will be posted in late june to the following groups x x comp lang c comp unix

re honors degrees do they mean anything in article tkld apr burns cogsci ed ac uk tkld cogsci ed ac uk kevin davidson writes in my opinion a programming degree is still worth having yes but a cs degree is not a programming degree does anybody know of a computing course where programming is taught computer science is a branch of maths or the course i did was i ve also done a software engineering course much more practical and likely to be the sort of thing an employer really wants rather than what they think they want but also did not teach programming the ability to program was an entry requirement at robert gordon university programming was the main most time consuming start of the course the first two years consisted of five subjects software engineering pascal c unix computer engineering assembler computer theory lisp prolog mathematics statistics and communication skills how to pass interviews intelligence tests and group discussions e g how to survive a helicopter crash in the north sea the third year industrial placement was spent working for a computer company for a year the company could be anywhere in europe there was a special travel allowance scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors the fourth year included operating systems c modula software engineering c assembler real time laboratory c assembler and computing theory lisp there were also group projects in nd and th years where students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an outside company the only disadvantage being that specifications would change suddenly in the first four years there was a weighting between courseworks and exams for most subjects however in the honours year this was reduced to a split between an individual project and final exams no coursework assessment are all computer science courses like this btw we started off with students in our first year and were left with by honours year also every course is tutored separately not easy trying to sleep when you are in student class cheers michael michael s a robb tel the problem with bolt on software engineer fax software is making sure the spider systems limited e mail bolts are the right size edinburgh eh ng michaelr spider co uk anonymous

sdc boeing com it retrofits into r some fixes made in r to get around this problem the patch is on export in contrib x r sunos patch version z subject why can t gcc compile x r on my sparc i used gcc to compile the whole distribution but i get several segmentation faults when running x note first that gcc on risc machines does not necessarily result in any performance increase it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the x or vax platforms here is the problem gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing structures as arguments and returning them as function values so when gcc compiled parts of x are linked with sun supplied functions that pass or return structs run time errors occur affected programs include rgb and the server this is from the gcc manual on the sparc gnu cc uses an incompatible calling convention for structures it passes them by including their contents in the argument list whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by reference this really ought to be fixed but such calling conventions are not yet supported in gnu cc so it isn t straightforward to fix it the convention for structure returning is also incompatible and fpcc struct return does not help you can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just the routines which cause incompatibilities the problem cannot be solved with compilation flags files which need to be compiled using cc include server os bsd oscolor c rgb rgb c in addition several of the inet functions use structs as args or return values clients xhost xhost c clients xauth gethost c calls to inet addr in lib clx socket c and lib x xconndis c are possibly harmless as they don t involve structs collected by bashford scripps edu don bashford subject what are these i o errors running x built

irrelevant differences like whitespace if the gcc version has x where the cc version has i your fixincludes run didn t work for some reason or other go back to your gcc sources and run fixincludes

these problems using r shared libraries on sunos all of the executables that i try to run have the following results ld so libxmu so not found or even ld so call to undefined procedure gethostname from xf a c if you are building with shared libraries on a sun remember that you need to run ldconfig as root after installing the shared libraries if you ve installed x on a file server run it on the server s clients too while building and installing the distribution you need to be careful to avoid linking against any existing x shared libraries you might have e g those distributed with openwindows you should make sure you do not have ld library path set in your environment during the build or the installation if you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs please note that the shared libraries must be installed in usr lib usr local lib or usr lib for these programs to work or else those programs must be linked statically courtesy mit x consortium note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build it attempts however to use the shared libraries before they have been installed you can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically pass bstatic to most c compilers subject can olit programs run with r xt xtqstring undefined this is a bug in the olit xtqstring was an external symbol that existed in x r upon which ow s libxt is based it wasn t documented and was removed in x r mit s guarantee of upward compatibility between the r and r libraries only applied to the documented interface a workaround is to temporarily set your ld library path to point to the x r or openwindows xt library that you linked the program against from barry margolin barmar think com from jeff francis jpf heliocentric com subject how do i get around the sunos security hole there is a security problem with certain r clients xterm and xload running under sunos that have been installed setuid root and are using shared libraries to avoid the problem do one of these make the program non setuid you should consult your system administrator concerning protection of resources e g ptys and dev kmem used by these programs to make sure that you do not create additional security problems at your site relink the programs statically using bstatic install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths to the libraries from rws expo lcs mit edu bob scheifler the r version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the newly installed libraries when xterm is being installed this prevents an suid program from being built with libraries specified relatively note that this may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from nfs mounted disks xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem subject how do i get around the frame buffer security hole on many systems the frame buffer is unsecured by default this permits anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by accessing the frame buffer directly or as less of a privacy issue but perhaps more annoying to accidentally start up a second x session on your console display check the man page for fbtab thanks to art mulder art cs ualberta ca subject topic building x programs subject what is imake imake is not a replacement for the make program instead it is a makefile generator that takes advantages of the include file and macro processing capabilities of the c preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles suitable for building software on a particular system although it is not specific to x the x release uses it to help solve a number of the configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable imake has a fairly steep learning curve in part because the process by which the system specific configuration files system independent configuration files and individual imakefiles are melded to produce a makefile is not obvious there have been several different versions of imake the r r and r versions are different you can obtain information on imake from these sources the r and r release notes and imake man page include information on using imake to build x the r and r file mit config readme also contains useful information on the r tapes contrib doc imake imake tex is mark moraes r r guide to imake the r mit doc config usenixws paper ms contains a paper by jim fulton on an early

tips on imake is in sasun epfl ch pub imakefile z subject where can i get imake versions are distributed with the r and r releases an earlier version is distributed with the x r release some third party toolkits redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the template and configuration files there are no real standards for such configuration files although most current contributed software expects the templates distributed with x r export contains the r distribution unpacked so you can pick up imake without picking up the entire distribution a stand alone version of imake but one stemming from x r is in ftp germany eu net pub x misc imake imake pure tar z subject i have a program with an imakefile but no makefile what to do if you have r or r installed on your system run xmkmf this is a script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments the output is a makefile configured for your system and based on the imakefile then run make which will use that new makefile to compile the program subject why can t i link to the xlib shape routines when i try to compile certain programs i get the following link error undefined xshapequeryextension xshapecombinemask these routines are actually part of the shape extension to x shape which was introduced in the mit x r distribution and allows non rectangular windows like the other sample server extensions the shape extension will only run on a server which supports it pre x r servers as well as many vendor supplied servers do not support the shape extension in which case they will display rectangular windows anyway in order to use the shape extension you must link to the library libxext a in the x r distribution this library and the associated includes will be in the mit extensions directory if you do not have these files do not despair many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be compiled without it by removing the dshape define from the makefile you can

shared libraries working apparently you can t share a function that is both called and compared as xtinherit is this was handled by putting xtinherit in the same file as a function that is always used thereby guaranteeing that it would be loaded that is in initialize c where xttoolkitinitialize and xtinitialize reside these routines would normally be called you are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal xt based program and does not call xttoolkitinitialize anywhere it may be a program that uses xt functions but never opens a connection to the x server osf motif s uil had this problem it called xtmalloc and other xt functions the solution is to add the call to your program the function does not have to be executed just linked in alternatively your program doesn t need any xt functions and is correct in not calling xttoolkitinitialize it may be an xlib or xview program in this case you can remove lxt from your link command it should not be necessary to link

true xsetwmhints dpy window wmhints if your application is based on the xt intrinsics you can set the xtninput resource to be true as you probably want to in any case if you don t have source you can

window manager is running you can t reliably tell whatever mechanism you could use could be spoofed in any case for most cases you shouldn t care which window manager is running so long as you do things in an icccm conformant manner there are some cases in which particular window managers are known to do things wrong checking for particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases alternatively it may be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take advantage of specific added features such as olwm s push pin menus in order to give your program added functionality beware of usurping the window manager s functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing this surely leads to future compatibility problems subject is there a skeleton x program available there is no general framework such as the transskel program for the macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional development in x the problem is typically solved by using an interactive application

something like this arg args int i int sensitive oops wrong data type i xtsetarg args i xtnsensitive sensitive i xtgetvalues widget args i but xtnsensitive is a boolean which on most machines is a single byte declaring the variable sensitive as boolean works properly this problem comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the xt types dimension and position code that assumes

xtconfigurewidget xtresizewidget xtmovewidget work you re probably trying to use these functions from application code they should be used only internally to widgets these functions are for a parent widget to change the geometry of its children other promising functions xtmakegeometryrequest and xtmakeresizerequest are also for use only by widgets in this case by a child to request a change from its parent the only way for your application to request a geometry change for a widget is to issue an xtsetvalues call setting some of the geometry resources although this will result in the widget internal functions being called your application code must use the standard xtsetvalues interface or risk the widgets data becoming corrupted the xlib calls xmovewindow and xresizewindow should similarly be avoided they shouldn t be used to change xtnx xtny xtnwidth or xtnheight subject why isn t there an xtreparentwidget call like xreparentwindow although there are various details of the current implementation of the xt internals which make reparenting difficult the major reason that no such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for the new widget should be resources are typically set based on the location in the instance hierarchy what resources should change if the instance moves what should happen to the widget s children and by the time such semantics are defined there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired resources as setting the resources

have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical sections if your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time which might be while the function you are calling is already executing it can leave the library in an inconsistent state note that the ansi c standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal itself so this is not a problem specific to xlib and xt the posix specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by xlib or xt functions

in any case subject how can my xt program handle socket pipe or file input it s very common to need to write an xt program that can accept input both from a user via the x connection and from some other file descriptor but which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the x connection or the other file descriptor a solution is use xtappaddinput after you open your file descriptor use xtappaddinput to register an input handler the input handler will be called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your program s attention write the input handler like you would any other xt callback so it does its work quickly and returns it is important to use only non blocking i o system calls in your input handlers most input handlers read the file descriptor although you can have an input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file you will find that the function is called even when there isn t input pending xtappaddinput is actually working as it is supposed to the input handler is called whenever the file descriptor is ready to be read not only when there is new data to be read a disk file unlike a pipe or socket is almost always ready to be read however if only because you can spin back to the beginning and read data you ve read before the result is that your function will almost always be called every time around xtappmainloop there is a way to get the type of interaction you are expecting add this line to the beginning of your function to test whether there is new data if ioctl fd fionread n n return but because this is called frequently your application is effectively in a busy wait you may be better off not using xtappaddinput and instead setting

which includes the information about one of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single x display supports a server can support several independent screens they are numbered unix unix unix etc the screen or screen number is the second digit the which can be thought of as an index into the array of available screens on this particular display connection the macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular screen on which your application is running typically have two forms one which takes a screen and one with takes both the display and the screen number in xt based programs you typically use xtscreen widget to determine the screen on which your application is running if it uses a single screen part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros which return characteristics of the screen have display in the names xdisplaywidth xdisplayheight etc subject can i use c with x motif xview the x r header files are compatible with c the motif header

order to create a window which is mostly transparent you have several choices the shape extension first released with x r offers an easy way to make non rectangular windows so you can set the shape of the window to fit the areas where the window should be nontransparent however not all servers support the extension a machine specific method of implementing transparent windows for particular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware note that there is no x notion of a transparent color index a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny windows but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application

undefined and visually random unless you have actually filled it in yourself on many x servers black and white often or programs taking advantage of this mathematical coincidence will break if you want to be combining colors with gxxor then you should be allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen pre computed values if you want to use gxxor simply to switch between two colors then you can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the gc graphics context to and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over red say the result is

between the time that you got the id and the time you sent an event to the window or otherwise manipulated it what you should do is send the event without checking but install an error handler to

another window courtesy ken lee klee synoptics com subject can i have two applications draw to the same window yes the x server assigns ids to windows and other resources actually the server assigns some bits the client others and any application that knows the id can manipulate the resource almost any x server resource except for gcs and private color cells can be shared the problem you face is how to disseminate the window id to multiple applications a simple way to handle this and which solves the problem of the applications running on different machines is in the first application to create a specially named property on the root window and put the window id into it the second application then retrieves the property whose name it also knows and then can draw whatever it wants into the window note this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first application running and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned in the question about using window ids on remote displays note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher level cooperation among your applications note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to use the same

mouse larry mcrcim mcgill edu der mouse subject how do i get a double click in xlib users of xt have the support of the translation manager to help get notification of double clicking there is no good way to get only a double click in xlib because the protocol does not provide enough support to do double clicks you have to do client side timeouts unless the single click action is such that you can defer actually taking it until you next see an event from the server thus you have to do timeouts which means system dependent code on most unixish implementations you can use xconnectionnumber to get the file descriptor of the x connection and then use select or something similar on that note that many user interface references suggest that a double click be used to extend the action indicated by a single click if this is the case in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it too should be the single click action or the double click action thanks to mouse larry mcrcim mcgill edu der mouse subject how do i render rotated text xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics capabilities leaving them up to server extensions or clients side graphics libraries your only choice if you want to stay within the core x protocol is to render the text into a pixmap read it back via xgetimage rotate it by hand with whatever matrices you want and put it back to the server via xputimage more specifically create a bitmap b and write your text to it create an xybitmap image i from b via xgetimage create an xybitmap image i big enough to handle the transformation for each x y in i i x y i a b where a x cos theta y sin theta b x sin theta y cos theta render i note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose bits an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better the high level server extensions and graphics packages available for x also permit rendering of rotated text display postscript pex phigs and gks although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the same fonts that would be found on a printer in addition if you have enough access to the server to install a font on it you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some predefined angle your application can then itself figure out placement of each glyph courtesy der mouse mouse larry mcrcim mcgill edu eric taylor etaylor wilkins bmc tmc edu and ken lee klee synoptics com liam quin lee sq com interviews c ui toolkit in the x

re pixmaps masks icons clues in article sophia inria fr lehors koala inria fr arnaud le hors writes in article buzz mar lion bear com buzz bear com buzz moschetti writes this is a simple x graphics question assume you have a valid window w an icon pixmap and the background mask also a pixmap for that icon you wish to place the icon at x y in w without the background question what combination of xcopyarea and gc functions are necessary i think the idea is to merge only those pixels of pixmap into w as indicated by the corresponding mask pixel value specifically the problem involves a pixmap and mask generated by the xpm libs any clues would be most appreciated xpm provides you with symbolic color names which can be specified at load time so for doing what you want i would suggest you to define a background symbol in your pixmap file which you ll set to whatever color is used by the widget or the window on which you want to put your pixmap this would surely be the simplest and fastest way to do what you want no as soon as you blit two of this icons once on top of the other with a little dislocation you see the rectangular blit crashes too much of the icon first blitted because it draws a full rectangle the way to do it is masking create a bitmap with all pixels to be merged are and all not to be merged are then set the clip mask of the gc to this bitmap set the clip x origin and clip y origin of the gc to the x y coordinates where you blit the icon to the destination drawable use gxcopy and xcopyarea the icon pixmap to the destination drawable using this gc o o o brain inside o o o o andre beck abpsoft mehl andre beck irs inf tu dresden de o o o

work membership in the consortium open to any organization there are two categories of membership member for large organizations and affiliate for smaller organizations most of the consortium s activities take place via electronic mail with meetings when required as designs and specifications take shape interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations typically a small multi organization architecture team leads the design with others acting as close observers and reviewers once a complete specification is produced it may be submitted for formal technical review by the consortium as a proposed standard the standards process typically includes public review outside the consortium and a demonstration of proof of concept your involvement in the public review process or as a member or affiliate of the consortium is welcomed write to bob scheifler mit x consortium laboratory for computer science technology square cambridge ma for complete information see the xconsortium man page from the x r distribution from which this information is adapted subject just what are open look and motif open look and motif are two graphical user interfaces guis open look was developed by sun with help from at t and many industry reviewers motif was developed by the open software foundation osf with input from many osf members open look is primarily a user interface specification and style guide there are several toolkits which can be used to produce open look applications motif includes an api specification the only sanctioned motif toolkit is the one from osf however there are other toolkits which can be used to produce programs which look and behave like osf motif one of these parcplace s formerly solbourne s oi is a virtual toolkit which provides objects in the style of open look and motif at the user s choice open look gui is also the name of a product from at t comprising their open look intrinsics toolkit and a variety of applications thanks to ian darwin ian sq com subject just what is openwindows open windows is a sun product that encompasses a window system that combines a news and x compliant server x news a user interface specification open look and a series of toolkits that implement it including the sunview like xview and the xt based olit xlib and xt implementations and a number of utilities olwm window manager filemgr shelltool etc thanks to frank greco fgreco govt shearson com subject just what is decwindows decwindows is a dec product that encompasses an x server the xui toolkit including the dwt widget set and uil xlib and xt implementations a session manager and a number of utilities dxwm window manager dxcalendar dxpsview etc at some point motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped subject what is pex pex is the phigs extension to x phigs stands for programmer s hierarchical interactive graphics system and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation and manipulation of d graphics many platforms are capable of performing in hardware the computations involved in rendering d objects the extension allows the client phigs in this case to take advantage of the specialized hardware for d graphics sun microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely redistributable copyright similar to the current x copyright sample implementation source and documentation are available in the r release several vendors are currently selling independently developed pex servers for their workstations and x terminals last modified subject what is low bandwidth x lbx xremote ppp slip cslip there are several options for using x over serial lines slip serial line ip this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending ip packets over point to point serial links it has been around for several years and implementations are available for many of the major tcp ip implementations most x terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item although nobody really ever uses it since it is horribly slow the tcp ip headers add bytes per packet and the tcp ip encoding of the x protocol is rather verbose rightfully so it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high speed links cslip compressed header slip this is a variant of slip that compresses the bytes of tcp ip headers down to about or bytes it still doesn t do anything about reencoding the x protocol modems that do compression can help but they increase packet latency it takes time to dribble the uncompressed data through typical serial interfaces plus the compression assembly time ppp point to point protocol this is an emerging standard for point to point links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than slip a growing number of people see the combination of ppp for the serial line management and cslip for the header compression as becoming common for running normal tcp ip protocols over serial lines running raw x over the wire still needs compression somewhere to make it usable xremote this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally developed by ncd for squeezing the x protocol over serial lines in addition to using a low level transport mechanism similar to ppp cslip xremote removes redundancies in the x protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and using lzw to compress the entire data stream this work is done by either a pseudo x server or proxy running on the host or in a terminal server there are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem you don t have to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn t otherwise be using them e g if you were going to be directly connected and it reduces the i o overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that have to cross the serial interface and in addition to the effects of it reduces the latency in delivering packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for blocks to compress lbx low bandwidth x this is an x consortium project that is working on a standard for this area it is being chaired by ncd and xerox and is using ncd s xremote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol lbx will go beyond xremote by adding proxy caching of commonly used information e g connection setup data large window properties font metrics keymaps etc and a more efficient encoding of the x protocol the hope is to have a standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample implementation available in r additional technical information about how xremote works and a few notes on how lbx might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export lcs mit edu in contrib in the following files xremote slides ps slides describing xremote xremote lbx diffs ps more

in day to day life subject what are all these different window managers the window manager in x is just another client it is not part of the x window system although it enjoys special privileges and so there is no single window manager instead there are many which support different ways for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout decoration and keyboard and

workspaces dwm sgi s enhanced mwm piewm this version of tvtwm offers pie menus subject why does my x session exit when i kill my window manager sic it needn t what is probably happening is that you are running your window manager as the last job in your xsession or xinitrc file your x session runs only as long as the last job is running and so killing your window manager is equivalent to logging out instead run the window manager in the background and as the last job instead invoke something safe like exec xterm name login rv iconic or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action your x session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window whether or not you kill or restart your window manager subject can i save the state of my x session like toolplaces does although no known window manager directly supports such a feature which may be equivalent to writing out a xinitrc or xsession file naming the geometry and wm command of each application but olvwm may have something close there is a contributed application which does much of what you are looking for although it is not as complete as the sunview program toolplaces look for the application xplaces on an archive server near you there are several versions of this program floating around look for a recent vintage some new pseudo session managers such as hp s vuewm provide for the saving of

rate which is a capability not supported by all systems some servers running on systems that support this however may provide command line flags to set the rate at start up time if you have control over server start up see the man pages for xinit and xdm you can invoke the server with the chosen settings for example you can start the xsun server from mit with the options ar ar to reduce the sensitivity of the keyboard subject how do i remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string there is no method of arranging for a particular string to be produced when you press a particular key the xmodmap client which is useful for moving your ctrl and esc keys to useful places just rearranges keys and does not do macro expansion some few clients including xterm and several x based editors accept a translation resource such as xterm vt translations override key f string setenv display unix which permits the shorthand f to be pressed to reset the display locally within an xterm it takes effect for new xterm clients to include control characters in the string use nnn where nnn is the octal encoding of the control character you want to include window managers which could provide this

session managers or other desktop programs which include print portion of screen or take a snapshot options some platforms also have tools which can be used to grab the frame buffer directly the sun systems for example have a screendump program which produces a sun raster file some x terminals have local screen dump utilities to write postscript to a local serial printer some vendors

carroll larryc poe jpl nasa gov subject how can i change the titlebar of my xterm window the solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the string which appears in the window titlebar a solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell echo esc text g where esc is the escape key text is the string you wish to have displayed and g is a control g the bel character here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to the current working directory when you change directories alias newcd cd echo n esc cwd g the digit in these strings indicates to xterm that it should change only the title of the window to change both the title and the name used in the icon use the digit instead and use to change only the icon name note another way to do this which prevents an incorrect display of the local directory if a modified cd is used in a subshell is to wrap the escape sequences into the ps prompt itself note on an ibm rs is may be necessary to begin the sequence with a v subject where can i find the xterm control sequences the best source of such information is in your r sources in the file ctlseqs ms a postscript version is in mit hardcopy clients ctlseqs ps z o reilly s volume the x user s guide includes an r version of the control sequences the standard

normal c iso xterm boldfont bold r normal c iso the family is intentionally unspecified in this example in addition you may want to set this in your shell setenv lc ctype iso for a given character above you can determine the key to use with the alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below try using man ascii for example o umlaut v is alt v and the section character is alt thanks to greg holmberg greg thirdi uunet uu net and stephen gildea gildea expo lcs mit edu subject why are my xterm menus so small you are probably setting the geometry small accidentally if you give a resource specification like this xterm geometry x then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to x for the main window this is ok as it uses characters for its size but its popup menus don t they are in pixels and show up small to set only the terminal widget to have the specified geometry name it explicitly xterm vt geometry x subject how can i print the current selection you could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command however a program by richard hesketh rlh ukc ac uk specifically for manipulating the selection will help e g xselection primary lpr finds the primary selection and prints it this command can be placed in a window manager menu or in shell scripts xselection also permits the setting of the selection and other properties a version is on export also available is ria ccs uwo ca pub xget selection tar z which can be adapted to do this subject how does xt use environment variables in loading resources you can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your xt based programs xfilesearchpath xuserfilesearchpath and xapplresdir these environment variables control where xt looks for application defaults files as an application is initializing xt loads at most one app defaults file from the path defined in xfilesearchpath and another from the path defined in xuserfilesearchpath set xfilesearchpath if software is installed on your system in such a way that app defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies suppose for example that you are running sun s open windows and you also have some r x applications installed in usr lib x app defaults you could set a value like this for xfilesearchpath and it would cause xt to look up app defaults files in both usr lib x and usr openwin lib or wherever your openwinhome is located setenv xfilesearchpath usr lib x t n openwinhome lib t n the value of this environment variable is a colon separated list of pathnames the pathnames contain replacement characters as follows see xtresolvepathname n the value of the filename parameter or the application s class name t the value of the file type in this case the literal string app defaults c customization resource r only s suffix none for app defaults l language locale and codeset e g ja jp euc l language part of l e g ja t the territory part of the display s language string c the codeset part of the display s language string let s take apart the example suppose the application s class name is myterm also suppose open windows is installed in usr openwin notice the example omits locale specific lookup usr lib x t n means usr lib x app defaults myterm openwinhome lib t n means usr openwin lib app defaults myterm as the application initializes xt tries to open both of the above app defaults files in the order shown as soon as it finds one it reads it and uses it and stops looking for others the effect of this path is to search first in usr lib x then in usr openwin let s consider another example this time let s set xuserfilesearchpath so it looks for the file myterm ad in the current working directory then for myterm in the directory app defaults setenv xuserfilesearchpath n ad home app defaults n the first path in the list expands to myterm ad the second expands to home app defaults myterm this is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the imake convention of naming the app defaults file myterm ad in the application s source directory so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly note when looking for app default files with xuserfilesearchpath for some bizarre reason neither the type nor file suffix is defined so t and s are useless with r there s another twist you may specify a customization resource value for example you might run the myterm application like this myterm xrm customization color if one of your pathname specifications had the value usr lib x t n c then the expanded pathname would be usr lib x app defaults myterm color because the c substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource the default xfilesearchpath compiled into xt is usr lib x l t n c r usr lib x l t n c r usr lib x t n c r usr lib x l t n usr lib x l t n usr lib x t n note some sites replace usr lib x with a projectroot in this batch of default settings the default xuserfilesearchpath also compiled into xt is root l n c r root l n c r root n c r root l n root l n root n root is either the value of xapplresdir or the user s home directory if xapplresdir is not set if you set xuserfilesearchpath to some value other than the default xt ignores xapplresdir altogether notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app defaults file in your current working directory is to set xapplresdir to a single dot in r all this machinery worked differently for r compatibilty many people set their xapplresdir value to a dot followed by a slash thanks to oliver jones oj world std com subject how to i have the r xdm put a picture behind the log in window the answer lies in changing xdm s xrdb resource in the xdm config file to run a program to change the background before loading the resources for example your usr lib x xdm xdm config file may add the line displaymanager authorize false to permit unrestricted access to the display before log in beware and also displaymanager xrdb usr lib x xdm new xrdb where that file does something for all connections along the lines of bin sh comes in with arguments display load usr lib x xdm xresources usr bin x xsetroot display bitmap usr lib x xdm new bitmap usr bin x xrdb substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot to taste note that this is a general hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client thanks to jay bourland jayb cauchy stanford edu subject why isn t my path set when xdm runs my xsession file when xdm runs your xsession it doesn t source your cshrc or login files you can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any sh script or you can place all environment setting statements in a separate file and source it from both the xsession file and your shell configuration file or if you set your path in your cshrc file the normal place you can make your xsession have path set simply by making it a csh script i e by starting your xsession file off with bin csh if this doesn t work also try starting off with bin sh reset path path csh c echo path export path subject how do i keep my display when i rlogin to another machine there are several ways to avoid having to do a setenv display whenever you log in to another networked unix machine running x one solution is to use the clients xrsh on the r contrib tape it includes xrsh a script to start an x application on remote machine and xrlogin a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine a more recent version is on export in xrsh shar one solution is to use the xrlogin program from der mouse mouse larry mcrcim mcgill edu you can ftp caveat emptor versions from in x xrlogin c and x xrlogind c the program packages up term and display into a single string which is stuffed into term rlogin then propagates term normally your cshrc on the remote machine should contain eval xrlogind where xrlogind is a program that checks term and if it is of the special format it recognizes unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to recreate the environment variables in addition if all you need to do is start a remote x process on another host and you find rsh host n usr bin x xterm display display too simple display must have your real hostname then this version of xrsh can be used to start up remote x processes the equivalent usage would be xrsh host xterm bin sh start an x process on another host date dec gmt from chris torek chris mimsy umd edu rsh host n

work sic after you have built the font using your system s font compiler installed it in some directory and run mkfontdir or your system s equivalent e g bldfamily for openwindows in that directory be sure to use xset fp dir to add that full path name to the server s font path or if the directory is already in the path use xset fp rehash so that the new fonts in that directory are actually found it is this last step that you re probably leaving out you can also use xset q to make sure that that directory is in the path sometimes your xset fp dir command fails with a badvalue error x error of failed request badvalue integer parameter out of range for operation major opcode of failed request x setfontpath this means the x server cannot find or read your font directory or that your directory does not look like a font directory to the server the mention of an integer parameter in the message is spurious is the font directory you re specifying readable from the server s file system remember it s the server not the client which interprets your font directory trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an xset command with shell metacharacters in it e g xset fp myfonts and the server is an x terminal or managed by xdm is the directory really a font directory if you re running an mit server or most varieties of vendor servers look in the directory for the file fonts dir if

since there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps therefore neither the x toolkit or the athena widget set define a string to pixmap converter because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a resource the athena widget set does define a string to bitmap converter for use in many of its widgets however courtesy chris d peterson now kit ics com however a specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of the xloadimage package by jim frost was posted by sebastian wangnick basti unido informatik uni dortmund de it permits loading of a number of image formats as a pixmap the leading general purpose format for pixmaps is the xpm format used by groupe bull in several of its programs including the gwm window manager by at t in its olpixmap editor and by ics in its interface builder xpm distribution available on export as contrib xpm tar z includes read write routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets

comp windows x frequently asked questions faq archive name x faq part last modified subject where can i get patches to x r the release of new public patches by the mit x consortium is announced in the comp windows x announce newsgroup patches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other sites from which x is available they are now also distributed through the newsgroup comp sources x some source re sellers may be including patches in their source distributions of x people without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server it now has patches for x r send to xstuff expo lcs mit edu the subject line send fixes where is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch here are a few complications fix is in four parts you need to request a b c and d separately the file sungx uu which was part of an earlier patch was re released with patch note the file doesn t work with solaris fix is in two parts a and b fix is in three parts a b and c fix is in two parts a and b fix replaces the r fix test for the x test suite which previously was optional fix also needs pexlib tar z which you can obtain from xstuff by asking for pexlib uu fix is in parts a through i subject what is the xstuff mail archive the xstuff server is a mail response program that means that you mail it a request and it mails back the response any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line the xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything so you can have several different commands in a single message unless you ask for help the xstuff server treats the subject header line just like any other line of the message the archives are organized into a series of directories and subdirectories each directory has an index and each subdirectory has an index the top level index gives you an overview of what is in the subdirectories and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it the command help or send help causes the server to send you a more detailed version of this help file if your message contains a line whose first word is index then the server will send you the top level index of the contents of the archive if there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories then the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top level index for example you can say send index fixes or index fixes a message that requests an index cannot request data if your message contains a line whose first word is send then the xstuff server will send you the item s named on the rest of the line to name an item you give its directory and its name for example send fixes a b you may issue multiple send requests the xstuff server contains many safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large amounts of data the mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed amount of data each day if the work queue contains more requests than the day s quota then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day whenever the mailer is run to send its day s quota it sends the requests out shortest first some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting return addresses if you use such a mailer you won t get any response if you happen to know an explicit path you can include a line like path foo bar bitnet mitvma mit edu or path bar foo frotz in the body of your message and the daemon will use it the xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff expo lcs mit edu if your mailer deals in notation try sending to someplace mit eddie expo

re q how to avoid xopendisplay hang in article c xr oy skates gsfc nasa gov andy ice stx com writes i m writing xwall a simple x version of wall and i want it to put a message up on each of a default list of displays the problem is that xopendisplay hangs if one of the displays is currently controlled by xdm login screen xdm does xgrabserver when it s running in secure mode so do some screen locks there s really no simple way to tell this is the case you can take xdm out of secure mode probably not too cool you can wrap your call to xopendisplay in some code which solicts a future sigalrm and longjmps past the xopendisplay from the signal handler an example of this can be seen in the xdm sources note that longjmping out of xopendisplay probably causes a memory leak any program functioning this way probably needs to exit regularly

faster cpu s more disk space faster ethernet these are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the performance of your workstation well more hardware isn t always an option and i wonder if more hardware is always even a necessity this faq list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from x windows on your workstation without purchasing more hardware performance is a highly subjective issue the individual user must balance speed versus features in order to come to a personal decision therefore this document can be be expected to contain many subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts this document is specifically concerned with x there are of course many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation however they are outside the scope of this document people seriously interested in the whole area of system performance might want to look at the o reilly nutshell handbook system performance tuning by mike loukides i m about of the way through reading it and it looks like a well written comprehensive treatment of system performance i m unaware of any

the informative and well written comp windows x frequently asked questions document its focus is on general x information while this faq concentrates on performance the comp windows x faq does address the issue of speed but only with regards to the x server the gist of that topic seems to be use x r it is faster than r please see the x faq for complete details window managers there are a lot of window managers out there with lots of different features and abilities the choice of which to use is by necessity a balancing act between performance and useful features at this point most respondents have agreed upon twm as the best candidate for a speedy window manager a couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger is turning off unnecessary things like zooming and opaque move also if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner you reduce the amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping windows joe english joe trystero art com i ve found that a good font for tiling is x aka misc fixed medium r normal c iso it is the biggest font i know of that i can use on my sun x screen and still get two column terminal windows side by side on the display with no overlap other font suggestions will be accepted the x server which server make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware if you have a monochrome monitor use a monochrome x server on my monochrome sun i haven t noticed much difference between the xsun colour server and xsunmono however it was pointed out to me that xsunmono is about k smaller and therefore should contribute to less paging thanks to jonny farringdon j farringdon psychol ucl ac uk michael salmon michael salmon eos ericsson se how your server was compiled can also make a difference jeff law law schirf cs utah edu advises us that on a sun system x should be compiled with gcc version or with the unbundled sun compiler you can expect to get very large speedups in the server by not using the bundled sunos compiler i assume that similar results would occur if you used one of the other high quality commercial compilers on the market locking the server into ram has anyone tried hacking the x server so that it is locked into ram and does not get paged eg via a call to plock does this help performance at all i ve had one inquiry on this topic and a few pointers to the plock function call but no hard evidence from someone who s tried it i am not in a position to give it a try thanks to eric c claeys ecc eperm att com danny backx db sunbim be juan d martin juando cnm us es starting your server joe english joe trystero art com if you start up a lot of clients in your xsession or whatever sleep for a second or two after launching each one after i changed my xclients script to do this logging in actually took less time we have a heavily loaded system without much core though this sounds crazy but i have confirmed that it works warner losh imp solbourne com provided me with a good explanation of why this works which i have summarized here when you start up an x server it takes a huge amount of time to start accepting connections a lot of initialization is done by the server when it starts this process touches a large number of pages any other process running at the same time would fight the server for use of the cpu and more importantly memory if you put a sleep in there you give the server a chance to get itself sorted out before the clients start up similarly there is also a lot of initialization whenever an x client program starts toolkits registering widgets resources being fetched programs initializing state and databases and so forth all this activity is typically memory intensive once this initialization is done the process has reached a steady state the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages by using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your xinitrc you avoid them fighting each other for your workstation s limited resources this is most definitely a your mileage may vary situation as there are so many variables to be considered available ram local swap space load average number of users on your system which clients you are starting etc currently in my xinitrc i have a situation like sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm i ve experimented with sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm i ve even tried sleep exec start x clients script and then in start x clients script i had sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm the idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had completely finished processing my xinitrc and had settled down into a steady state before the sleep expired and all my clients were launched all of these yielded fairly comparable results and so i just stuck with my current setup for its simplicity you will probably have to experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you fonts loading fonts takes time and ram if you minimize the number of fonts your applications use you ll get speed increases in load up time one simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts one small one large one roman whatever suits you and configure all your clients or at least all your heavily used clients to use only those few fonts client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded into the server this will also conserve server resources since fewer fonts will be loaded by the server farrell mckay fbm ptcburp ptcbu oz au joe english joe trystero art com eg my main xterm font is x so i also have twm set up to use x in all it s menus and icons etc twm s default font is x since i don t normally use x i ve eliminated one font from my server oliver jones oj roadrunner pictel com keep fonts local to the workstation rather than loading them over nfs if you will make extensive use of r scalable fonts use a font server about the resources file keep your xresources xdefaults file small saves ram and saves on server startup time joe english joe trystero art com one suggestion in your xdefaults xresources file try putting only the minimum number of resources that you want to have available to all of your applications for example reversevideo true then separate your resources into individual client specific resource files for example home lib app defaults in your login file set the environment variable xuserfilesearchpath setenv xuserfilesearchpath home lib app defaults n the comp windows x frequently asked questions faq contains an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work ed so when xterm launches it loads its resources from app defaults xterm xdvi finds them in app defaults xdvi and so on and so forth note that not all clients follow the same xxxxx resource file naming pattern you can check in your system app defaults directory often usr x r lib x app defaults to find the proper name and then name your personal resource files with the same name this is all documented in the xt specification pg thanks to kevin samborn samborn mtkgc com michael urban urban cobra jpl nasa gov and mike long mikel ee cornell edu kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers this method of organizing your personal resources has the following benefits easier to maintain more usable fewer resources are stored in the x server in the resource manager property as a side benefit your server may start fractionally quicker since it doesn t have to load all your resources applications only process their own resources never have to sort through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them it also has drawbacks the application that you are interested in has to load an additional file every time it starts up this doesn t seem to make that much of a performance difference and you might consider this a huge boon to usability if you are modifying an application s resource database you just need to re run the application without having to xrdb again xrdb will by default run your xdefaults file through cpp when your resources are split out into multiple resource files and then loaded by the individual client programs they will not watch out for this i had c style comments in my xdefaults file which cpp stripped out when i switched to this method of distributed resource files i spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why my clients were not finding their resources xt did not provide any error message when it encountered the c style comments in the resource files it simply silently aborted processing the resource file the loss of preprocessing which can be very handy e g ifdef color is enough to cause some people to dismiss this method of resource management you may also run into some clients which break the rules for example neither emacs nor xvt will find their resources if they are anywhere other than in xdefaults when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files with the machine where your resources are stored your client will not find its resources loading all your resources into the server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find their resources casey leedom casey gauss llnl gov a possible compromise suggestion that i have and am planning on trying is to put resources for all my heavily used clients eg xterm into my xdefaults file and to use the separate resources files method for clients that i seldom use define your display properly client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server in that situation rather than setting your display environment variable to hostname where hostname is the name of your workstation you should set your display variable to unix or by doing this you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests thanks to patrick j horgan pjh ras amdahl com see the display names section of the x man page for further explanation of how to properly set your display name i don t think it s stock mit but at least data general and hp have libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when the display isn t set specially rob sartin opensi sartin uunet uu net jody goldberg jody algorithmics com sent me an xlib patch to change stock r to use local communication even if display is not properly set i don t want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle non mit patches and so have elected not to include it here hopefully mit will apply this minor lines patch themselves in the meantime if you want to try it yourself email jody ed clients if you only have a few megabytes of ram then you should think carefully about the number of programs you are running think also about the kind of programs you are running for example is there a smaller clock program than xclock unfortunately i haven t really noticed that programs advertise how large they are so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients eg xclock xterm xbiff are welcome ed i ve received some contradictory advice from people on the subject of x client programs some advocate the use of programs that are strictly xlib based since xt xaw and other toolkits are rather large others warn us that other applications which you are using may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries in this case using a non xt for example client program may actually increase the amount of ram consumed the upshot of all this seems to be don t mix toolkits that is try and use just athena clients or just xview clients or just motif clients etc if you use more than one then you re dragging in more than one toolkit library know your environment and think carefully about which client programs would work best together in that environment thanks to rob sartin opensi sartin uunet uu net duncan

the distribution ugly maybe but at my site it s still the most used i suspect that xterm is one of the most used clients at many if not most sites laziness isn t there a better terminal emulator

suggested by richard hesketh rlh ukc ac uk available export lcs mit edu in contrib xvt tar z if you don t need all the esoteric features of xterm then get hold of xvt it was written here just to save swap space as xterm is rather a hog this was written as a partial clone of xterm you don t have to rename your resources as xvt pretends to be xterm in it s current version you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm i ve heard that there are versions of xvt with this feature but i ve not found any yet update march i recently had a few email conversations with brian warkentin brian warkentine eng sun com regarding xvt he questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm for instance xvt may initialize slightly faster but compare scrolling speed try this quickie benchmark bin time dd if etc termcap bs and see which program can scroll faster also while xterm may be slightly larger in ram requirements we don t have any hard numbers here does anyone else shared libraries and shared text segments mean that xterm s paging requirements are not that major as an experiment he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm but it made little difference since if you never use it it never gets brought into memory so here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of xvt over xterm in summary caveat emptor your mileage may vary if you can provide some hard data i d like to see it specifically how much ram each occupies how much swap each needs relative speed of each mterm suggested by der mouse mouse lightning mcrcim mcgill edu available larry mcrcim mcgill edu in x mterm src mterm ball o wax i also have my own terminal emulator its major lack is scrollback but some people like it anyway tuning your client suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster from scott barman scott asd com comes a suggestion regarding motif text field widgets i noticed that during data entry into motif text field widgets i was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes particularly the initial one in the field examining the what was going on with xscope i found it it seems that when the resource xmnblinkrate is non zero and the focus is on a text field widget or even just a text widget the i beam cursor will blink every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets the widget code is making a request to the server copyarea the user can stop this by setting the resource xmnblinkrate to it is not noticeable on a mhz sparc but it does make a little difference on a slower system this specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots of areas consider your heavily used clients are there any minor embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on server requests miscellaneous suggestions pretty pictures don t use large bitmaps gif s etc as root window backgrounds the more complicated your root window bitmap the slower the server is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows or redraw etc these take up ram and cpu power i work on a sun sparc and i m conscious of performance issues i can t comprehend it when i see people with a mb sun running xphoon as their root window i ll let someone else figure out how much ram would be occupied by having a full screen root image on a colour workstation if you re anything like me you need all the screen real estate that you can get for clients and so rarely see the root window anyway thanks to qiang alex zhao azhao cs arizona edu for reminding me of this one ed a quicker mouse using xset you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen when you move your mouse i use xset m in my xinitrc file which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of the wrist see the xset man page for further ideas and information hint sometimes you may

that you re developing there are tons of things you can do some that stick out for motif programs don t set xmfontlist resources for individual buttons labels lists et al use the defaultfontlist or labelfontlist or whatever resource of the highest level manager widget again stick to as few fonts as possible better yet don t use motif at all it s an absolute pig don t create and destroy widgets on the fly try to reuse them this will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits too use a line width of in gcs on some servers this makes a huge difference compress and collapse multiple expose events this can make the difference between a fast application and a completely unusable one francois staes frans kiwi uia ac be just a small remark i once heard that using a better malloc function would greatly increase performance of xt based applications since they use malloc heavily they suggested trying out the gnuy malloc but i didn t find the time yet i did some tests on small programs just doing malloc and free and the differences were indeed very noticeable somewhat times faster any confirmation on this from anyone ed andre beck andre beck irs inf tu dresden de unnecessary noexpose events most people use xcopyarea xcopyplane as fastest blit routines but they forget to reset graphics exposures in the gc used for the blits this will cause a noexpose event every blit that in most cases only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to run through it s event loop again and again thousands of xchangegc requests this gfx context switching is also seen in most handcoded x apps where only one or few gcs are created and then heavily changed again and again xt uses a definitely better mechanism by caching and sharing a lot of gcs with all needed parameters this will remove the load of subsequent xchangegc requests from the connection by moving it toward the client startup phase say what some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first david b lewis by day dbl osf org by night david craft uunet uu net how about this swap displays with someone else run all your programs on the other machine and display locally the other user runs off your machine onto the other display goal reduce context switches in the same operation between client and server i m not in a situation where i can easily try this but i have received the following confirmation michael salmon michael salmon eos ericsson se i regularly run programs on other machines and i notice a big difference i try to run on a machine where i will reduce net usage and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion this helps a lot on my poor little ss with only mb it was essential when i only had mb casey leedom casey gauss llnl gov the x server and the client are competing for the same cpu as your server when you run it on the same machine not really a major problem except that the x client and the server are in absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing timothy h panton thp westhawk uucp firstly it relies on the fact that most cpu s are mostly idle x s cpu usage is bursty so the chances of you and your teammate doing something cpu intensive at the same time is small if they are not then you get twice the cpu memory available for your action the second factor is that context switches are expensive using cpu s halves them you pay a price due to the overhead of going over the network but this is offset in most cases by the improved buffering of a network typically k vs k for a pipe allowing even fewer context switches other sources of

re app defaults files hello when starting bx if you recieve an error message saying cannot load app defaults file check your xapplresdir environment variable and then put the file builderxcessory this is the app defaults file for bx in the directory specified by the xuserfilesearchpath environment variable if you don t have an xuserfilesearchpath environment variable then set xuserfilesearchpath to be the directory where the builderxcessory file is you can do this using the setenv command under csh note that the name ends in ad so you will have to set xuserfilesearchpath to bx n ad to get the app defaults to load correctly to make sure the the app defaults file can be read by all the users make sure that a copy of or a link to the app defaults file exists in usr lib x app defaults or usr openwin lib app defaults depending on how your system is set up once you have taken care of this set the systemdirectory resource to be the directory in which you have installed bx for example let s say i ve installed bx in t then my system directory resource should be set like this systemdirectory t builderxcessory thanks ics tech support

gui study do users want to build solutions let me point out that both gui based word processors and text based formatters both have a language one happens to be mouse and action based and the other symbol based true but that s beside the point this is a fact about an abstract model of what the gui users are doing not about what they actually are doing this abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a programmer of the system nb some users may see it too but only when they put aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer i m not saying that the programmer s perspective is evil or stunted after all that s what i do too i am saying that ui designers must carefully distinguish between the user programmer conceptual models and they must ultimately serve the user of the system not the builder of the system i don t recall the actual stats but something like in people can be categorized as a symbol manipulator it would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this claim at any rate i don t think this is evidence that of users think like programmers bankers financial analysts structural engineers these are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol manipulation but what they do is not programming and programming is not required to do what they do to restate my previous point yes users want to build their own solutions no they do not want to do programming to accomplish this

re c toolkit directions in article imp hellnet org devil loki hellnet org gil tene writes i am trying to figure out the current c toolkit directions more simply i d like to know which c toolkit to bet on for use in a new long term project i have the same problem i have looked at motif wwl interviews gina and a few variations on the above i ve also done a cursory examination of rogue wave s view h i like view h s abstractions best of all of the toolkits i mentioned but the resulting code looks little like motif and i have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result in significant longevity for my code gina allows you to write code which looks a great deal like motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance but the resulting code is almost too motif like and is certainly not significantly less verbose than equivalent c code interviews looks promising but i haven t found a free version with motif support and i m not confident how widely interviews with motif support will be adopted and what if any specific motif support will be available over time the other libraries produce code which is less motif like but which does not make sufficient use of the features of c to simplify my coding task at this point my inclination is to write my motif manipulation routines in c and invoke those routines from my c code using simple abstractions suited to my specific task later if osf or some credible standards setting body comes up with a c interface to motif i will change to that it does me no goo to write in c if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry directions it s better to take a standard if inferior solution for now than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both useless code and useless skills a few years from now views h is the only library i d consider right now but in our environment we d end up spending nearly to use it and i can t justify it when it s likely to cause short term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction and is unlikely to be a sufficiently long lived solution for us to reap the benefits at the high end of the j curve brad brad daniels if money can t buy happiness daniels neosoft com i guess i ll have to rent it i don t work for neosoft and weird al yenkovic don t speak for my employer

re a question on window ids in article wnk aquifer geology uiuc edu wnk aquifer geology uiuc edu walter kreiling writes given a program running on a workstation with an x based window system how can one pop the window in which it is running to the top by window i mean the terminal window from which it was invoked one can t the application may not have been started from a terminal emulator if it was the terminal emulator may not still exist and if it does it may be in no condition to be pop ped to the top eg it may be iconified and even if you can it may not do what you want consider a virtual root window manager like tvtwm with the relevant window in a portion of the virtual desktop that s outside the real desktop some but not all x terminal emulators provide environment variables giving a window id even if such a thing is present in the environment it may not be what you want it may correspond to a window on a different server for example der mouse mouse mcrcim mcgill edu

re creating bit windows on bit display how in article apr fwi uva nl stolk fwi uva nl bram writes i am using an x server that provides visuals pseudocolor bit truecolor bit and directcolor bit lucky dog a problem occurs when i try to create a window with a visual that is different from the visual of the parent which uses the default visual which is tc in the xlib reference guide from o reilly one can read in the section about xcteatewindow something like in the current implementation of x when using a visual other than the parent s be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap which is to be used in the window attributes when creating or else a badmatch occurs this warning strangely enough is only mentioned in the newer editions of the x r guides it applies with equal force to earlier versions presumably only recently did the author s decide it was important enough to mention the necessity it refers to has always been there but it s been implicit in the way createwindow requests default some attributes of the new window however even if i pass along a suitable colourmap i still get a badmatch when i create a window with a non default visual attr colormap cmap win xcreatewindow copyfromparent border width depth inputoutput class vinfo visual visual cwcolormap attr this is because the warning you read is incomplete you have to provide not only a colormap but also a border the default border is copyfromparent which is not valid when the window s depth doesn t match its parent s specify a border pixmap of the correct depth or a border pixel and the problem should go away there is another problem i can t find anything to indicate that copyfromparent makes any sense as the border width parameter to xcreatewindow your xlib implementation probably defines copyfromparent as zero to simplify the conversion to wire format so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero due to the xlib implementation not providing stricter type checking to be fair i m not entirely certain it s possible for xlib to catch this der mouse mouse mcrcim mcgill edu

compiling help i d like to compile x r on a sony nws running news c the x distribution has support for this config and the release notes say it has been tested on the machine but also in the release notes nothing from sony is listed under the supported servers what am i supposed to use for my r x server then how can the os be supported but not the hardware is there something in the r binaries that can be used as the r server these may seem like silly questions but i m really confused mike hopper acs virginia edu i will not raise taxes on the middle class unknown
re compiling help here s what i think have figured out all i need to do is install the r disitribution without the xserver like the sony cf file defines and all the new libraries utils etc will be installed and my old server from r will still work this will allow me to run xview and have x r up and running does the server interface remain the same with all changes made only to the libs another question is it likely that since sun is dropping ow support that the desktop utils like the file manager will be made public it would be nice if companies would make old code public for the benefit of those of us with smaller budgets mike hopper acs virginia edu i will not raise taxes on the middle class unknown

r table widget causing trouble with xtquerygeometry contents problems with table widgets in r the following part of a program an user interface for a simulation system did work in r but refused to in r of cause the r version did not know about the xptablewidgetclass we used tablewidgetclass instead caught from the net in times of r and xptablechildposition formerly xttblposition since compiling with r the program causes a zero width or height error on sparc stations the trouble shooter is the re computation of the model init table table widget though its childs label and asciitext widgets exist xtquerygeometry returns a prefered width and height of zero thus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the width and height of the newly created widget to zero no wonder xtpopup or xtmanage child create zero width or height errors dependent on whether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource file or not question does anyone know why xtquerygeometry

re monthly question about xcopyarea and expose events in article buzz apr lion bear com buzz bear com buzz moschetti writes nd posting of the question that just doesn t seem to get answered suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that contains xlib graphics a button widget when pressed will cause a new item to be drawn in the window this action clearly should not call xcopyarea or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles regular expose events e g window manager driven exposures take care of rendering the new image using an expose event handler is a proper way to do this because at the time the handler is called the xlib window is guaranteed to be mapped the problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped what we need to do is somehow tickle the window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render just the part of the window that contains the new item what is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior to incrementally update the contents of windows i use the following trick set the window background to none call xcleararea display window true restore the window background to its correct value the call to xcleararea does not repaint the window background but still generates exposure events for visible parts of the window in order to let my application know that these expose events must be handled incrementally something is already displayed on the screen and may need to be erased i encapsulate the operations with self addressed client messages which preserve asynchronicity between the client and the server xgrabserver display client message start incremental background none xcleararea restore background client message end incremental xungrabserver display the grabserver prevents other events to be inserted by the server in the critical section vincent prunet sema group sophia antipolis inria bp sophia antipolis cedex france prunet sophia inria fr fax

re xcopyplane question in article buzz apr lion bear com buzz bear com buzz moschetti write in article whaley apr sigma kpc com whaley sigma kpc com ken whaley writes actually i must also ask the faq s most popular reason why graphics don t show up do you wait for an expose event before drawing your rectangle suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that contains xlib graphics a button widget when pressed will cause a new item to be drawn in the window this action clearly should not call xcopyarea or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the window is mapped the problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window is visible and mapped do you know the best way to tickle a window so that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item what does this have to do with my original question i previously stated that i did an xcopyarea of the depth pixmap to the screen just to make sure that my image had data and it did this is not a problem with expose events it has to do with xcopyplane not working does anyone have a code fragment they could send demonstrating that xcopyplane works this would be very helpful thanks what it has to do with your original question is this many times beginning x users heck experienced x users too write small test programs many times they forget to draw only in response to expose events and thus see unpreditable results whereby sometimes the application s graphics show up and sometimes they don t we re just trying to eliminate all the easy explanations for why you re not seeing your graphics that being said why don t you try copying different planes to your window other than try to see it you get any output since you re dipslaying only a single plane of your data it s possible that all the pixel values in your pixmap have the same value for that color plane ken kenneth whaley kubota pacific computer inc email whaley kpc com walsh avenue santa clara ca

cursors according to the osf motif style guide one should use cursor shapes to give the user a visual clue of what is happening or what is expected of him so a hourglass cursor should be shown when the application is busy or a caution cursor should be shown over an area when input is expected in another defining cursors for widgets has to be done at rather low level so defining a cursor for all widgets in an application but not for a certain subpart of it is a rather complicated matter when cursors have been defined for some windows e g a crosswire cursor for a drawingarea things get even more complicated my intuition says that things should be easier but is this so if anyone has a solid and complete solution to my problem please let me know the topics on busy cursors in the several faq s are not helpful since they only work for applications where all windows have the cursor window attribute set to none hans geurtsen phone nucletron research bv e mail hgn nuclint nl surface waardgelder nl th veenendaal

detecting read only colorcells again poseted for a friend okay i got such great response from my last question thanks everyone lets try again how can i tell if a colorcell is read only i want to use any read only cells that are already in my colormap once i start running out of allocatable cells using some arbitrary nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to a requested color once i determine if a cell is read only i assume i can then just request an xalloccolor with the exact same color specifications and it will then be flagged as used by my application so that it doesn t later get freed by someone else and allocated again as read write to another application so far the only way i ve figured out to do this is to write my own error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors once my colormap is all full up it should error out if the cell is non shareable but life would be much easier if i could just detect the read only shareable stuff directly any ideas noel ngorelic speclab cr usgs gov

question regarding overlaying of graphics hello i wonder if some one can suggest an answer to the following question i am a total x novice and would appreciate any suggestions you may have i am trying to create a simple drawing tool let s say i have two rectangles on the canvas see above one intersecting the other now i would like to delete one of the rectangles the way i do it is to create another gc wherein i use the gxxor logical function and simply redraw the rectangle using the newly created graphics context thus deleting it for all apparent purposes a problem with this approach is that at the points of intersection the pixel locations belonging to the other rectangle also become white which is something that should be avoided is there any way i can avoid this problem without having to redraw the other rectangle too i also would not like to generate an expose event for the affected area as this degrades performance very badly thank you gopal

vanishing font problem a colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new mips workstation when he first logs on via xdm he has a single xterm window appear with the mwm window manager running in this configuration x windows applications particularly xdvi work fine however if he opens up a second xterm application suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window giving the error unable to load iso font the only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the xsession file with prettier colours and other slight changes further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour and more significant all x applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window if i start the xterm with a different font using the fn option no problems it would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts note xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available so there doesn t appear to be a problem in the font directories hash tables other than rewriting the xterm app defaults file to use a different font and hope for the best does anyone have any ideas more info this is the most recent mips workstation r i believe with the most current operating system and running x r it is not mwm s fault as the same problems occur under twm etc

a strange problem with text hello i am testing a port of x r to coherent a unix clone os for intel architecture machines i am seeing a strange problem with text in clients like xvt a simple terminal emulator program the problem manifests it self when the shell echoes typed characters back to the server for display one at a time the characters appear to be too closely spaced with the result being that the nd character echoed destroys the rightmost edge of the first character then the rd character destroys the rightmost edge of the second character and so on it looks like there is an invisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previous character there is no problem between the characters when the shell returns a complete line of text only when the output is a series of individual characters if anyone has any ideas what the problem might be or where i should look to find it it would be much appreciated regards and thanks jon dhuse jon dhuse internet jdhuse sedona intel com intel corp ch phone w chandler blvd any opinions expressed are my own chandler az not my employer s

dynamic squeezetitle configuration in twm i consider twm style squeezed titles indispensable in a window manager i like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same time with no overlap and since two windows aren t enough i have other xterm windows underneath them with exactly the same positioning in case you re not familiar with squeezed titles here s a crude picture figure title a title b title c this is the window b hides window c but body of the you can still see c s title window window a which is squeezed right figure squeezed titles allow me to have about such windows in each stack with easy access and per stack is usually more than i really need since i also insist on having a virtual wm the only problem is that the title location is static that is it is configured in twmrc and in order to change it you have to edit that file and restart the window manager doing so is cumbersome and time consuming therefore i have implemented f squeeze left center right functions in my own copy of vtwm the idea being that with one click of a button you can change this title a this is the body of the window window a to this title a this is the body of the window window a okay so far so good now how the heck do i get them to put this into the next official twm and the next tvtwm and the next vtwm and the next ctwm and the next xyztwm that i never heard of one way would be to post in comp windows x a description of this enhancement together with an explanation of why i think it is a very good thing and hope that someone reads it in case it isn t already clear why i think it s a very good thing look back up at figure and picture window a moved over on top of windows b and c now window a s title hides window b s title but when you hit f squeezecenter the result is title b title a title c this is the body of the window window a which is on top the rest of this posting explains how to implement it based on my x r copy of vtvwm shar it s just a sketch because posting the full diffs would be too long the key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the executefunction routine in menus c ifdef shape case f squeezeleft static squeezeinfo left squeeze j left if deferexecution context func scr selectcursor return true tmp win squeeze info left squeeze setframeshape tmp win break and similarly for squeezeright j right and squeezecenter j center endif of course you also have to define f squeezeleft in parse h and add f squeezeleft fkeyword f squeezeleft and so forth to parse c in order to use these functions add something like the following to your twmrc file button m s w v d r i t door f squeezecenter about a year ago i posted this but our news was broken and i think it didn t get out since then blast has appeared in comp sources x volume issue you could use blast to achieve a similar effect by chiseling away at an mwm style wide title better to have a twm style window manager i think ralph betza fm uunet ssiny gnohmon gnohmon ssiny com the question of whether a computer can swim is more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can think lenny dykstra
re animation with xputimage shared memory putimage also mentioned by nkissebe delphi beckman uiuc edu nick kisseberth looks interesting but i need someone to point me to some documentation is this method likely to give better results than server resident pixmaps i d also be interested in looking at the xview code mentioned above there is no easy answer to this question it depends on whether the display device can hold pixmaps in off screen memory and if so how efficiently the server manages these resources having to deal with limited off screen memory is the bane of the server implementor s existence i have worked with graphics devices where the off screen memory to main display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copy rate and with those where the main memory to display is faster than off screen to display requires only a write to the framebuffer rather than a read of the f b followed by a write if your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render into pixmaps in cpu main memory the rates you can get through mit shm are likely to be equal maybe a tad slower depending on your os s implementation of shared memory to copyarea from pixmap to window which is also then just a copy from cpu main memory to graphics device one advanage of mit shm is that if your images are large you don t end up growing the size of the server process to hold them one disadvantage of the mit shm is that in its sample implementation there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments if the client dies a sudden violent death e g kill you have to be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments ken kenneth whaley kubota pacific computer inc email whaley kpc com walsh avenue santa clara ca
help on xlib and include files hi xperts i have a sparc with very limited disk space on usr partition previously i was able to run all x windows applications and then i upgraded my system to sun o s and realized that the hard disk did not have enough space to load openwindows my immediate alternative was to load only the neccessary files to boot the system this resulted in not loading openwindows as a result of which none of the x libraries got loaded i am trying to load just the libraries and include files and bin x files required for running x windows and compiling my programs written for xlib and xaw in a desperate effort to regain x windows i retrieved usr lib libx files from the tape usr bin x and usr include x is this enough for running x windows but i did not get usr lib x fonts sub directories these are mainly dpi dpi and misc when i run xinit the error message says usr lib x fonts dpi etc are not in the default path but the problem is i cannot load any of those directories as there is no disk space are there any temporary suggestions before i get a gb disk and load openwindows to just have my x windows running thanks pramod
writing a motif widget can anyone give me some information please i need probably to write one or more new motif widgets on the hp ux platform do i need the motif private header files and source or can i make do with the public headers that are provided motif includes xt in this context one widget is a multi column list which lots of people have already written i am sure and would therefore be probably be a subclass of list rather than something simple like an xt class is this more difficult in principle not lines of code alternatively if anyone has a multi column list widget they could sell me this might save me from having to write one does it by any chance exist in motif already i do not yet have the spec answers appreciated nicholas nicholas young

re question regarding overlaying of graphics let s say i have two rectangles on the canvas see above one intersecting the other now i would like to delete one of the rectangles the way i do it is to create another gc wherein i use the gxxor logical function and simply redraw the rectangle using the newly created graphics context thus deleting it for all apparent purposes a problem with this approach is that at the points of intersection the pixel locations belonging to the other rectangle also become white which is something that should be avoided you could set up a bitmap with a mask in it clear the bitmap draw the rectangle to be deleted with gxor draw the one that is to stay with gxclear then gxxor the entire pixmap with the screen note that this is a pretty effective way of animation if you ever need to do that replace the gxclear with a gxxor joe hildebrand hildjj fuentez com software engineer fuentez systems concepts standard disclaimers apply

re numlock masking interference with meta compose extendchar ralph seguin rps arbortext com wrote my question is this is there a means of determining what the state of capslock and or numlock is alright ignore this i have delved a bit deeper xkeyevent and found what i was looking for ev state has a bunch of masks to check against lockmask is the one for capslock unfortunately it appears that the numlock mask varies from server to server how does one tell what mask is numlock and which are for meta mod mask mod mask mod mask mod mask mod mask eg sgi s vendor server has mod mask being numlock whereas solaris openwindows has mod mask for numlock is there an unambiguous means of determining numlock s mask at runtime for any given server sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance you ll have to check the keysym s on each of the keys for each modifier the one with numlock in its mapping is the modifier you want a bit ugly perhaps but i think its currently the only way to do this and it does have some precedent as keysyms are used to differentiate capslock from shiftlock for the lock modifier i don t know of an accepted strategy for handling ambiguous assignments either ie what if numlock is mapped for more then one modifier i suppose first found is as good as any x doesn t handle locking modifiers that well hope that helps dave lapp standard disclaimer etc

re key definitions in emacs x in a prior article ajaffe oddjob uchicago edu andrew jaffe wrote hi i use emacs and i want to customize my keyboard better when i set up stuff in my emacs with a keymap and define keys i can only access certain of the keys on my x terminal s keyboard i can t get e g f home end pgup pgdn they all seem to have either the same or no keycode i have a feeling this can t be fixed in emacs itself but that i need to do some xmodmap stuff can someone help me unfortunately the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into emacs i ran into this problem a while back my solution was to change the source code so that all of these special keys generated character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier state as escape sequences for example the sequence esc b would indicate that the home key was pressed with the shift key down you could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers such as shift return if anybody wants these changes they re welcome to them but you ll have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with it a bit basically you have to replace the keypress handling code in the source file x term c maybe if someone at osf is interested i can send them the tweaks but i imagine they ve got bigger fish to fry hopefully including the much talked about emacs v if there s sufficient interest i ll post the mods somewhere although this probably isn t the appropriate group for it notes this special code will only apply if you let emacs create its own x window if you run it in plain old tty mode which includes xterm windows then it s business as usual the patches i made were to version under sun os i also did this a while back under hp ux the patches are in a chunk of code between if sun endif but could easily be adapted for anything else mark lanzo kd qlz lanzo tekelec com xx

re xt intrinsics slow popups bryan boreham bryan alex com wrote in article minster york ac uk cjhs minster york ac uk writes the application creates window with a button quit and press me the button press me pops up a dialog box the strange feature of this program is that it always pops up the dialog box much faster the first time if i try to pop it up a nd time rd th time it is much slower the shell is waiting for the window manager to respond to its positioning request the window manager is not responding because it thinks the window is already in the right place exactly why the two components get into this sulk is unclear to me all information greatly received thanks for this clue and thanks to derek ho also for a pointer in the same direction one solution due to derek ho when the popup is popped up we setvalue its location which on repeat popups will be unchanged from the previous popup the slow response can be avoided by calling getvalue first and only using setvalue if the required location is different the problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in the location of the popup so that the setvalue really does change the location of the popup we tried this just for a double check on the source of the problem the solutions we have tried successfully are now as follows use twm or mwm rather than olwm use olwm with resource wmtimeout only reset the location of the popup window if it is truely changed this is obviously working around some bug somewhere thanks chris ho stuart
overriding window manager focus processing i am working on an x window based application that needs to override some of the window manager focus processing i am using x r and motif currently although i will also be working with open look in the future what i need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the user from switching from one window of the application to another window let s say for example that window a is on top of window b in the window hierarchy normally if the user clicks the mouse in window b it will be brought to the top of the window hierarchy and placed on top of window a under certain circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in window b i need to beep and prevent window b from being raised on top of window a from the research and testing i ve done so far it appears that this window ordering is handled by the window manager in this case motif i haven t found any way to override this default processing through standard x window functions i can tell when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping notify events but i can t find any way to tell motif not to make the switch the temporary solution i ve currently come up with is very kludgy but it partially works when i detect such a window switch in those cases when the switch is not allowed i manually force the formerly top window back on top with an xraisewindow call and beep with the xbell function this provides the necessary functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places twice does anyone know how i can tell motif or preferably any window manager when i don t want the window order switch to actually take place respond either by e mail or posting to this newsgroup cheers randall randall severy uunet uunet ge severy ge information services internet ge severy uunet uu net n washington st mc a genie rsevery rockville md usa phone

how to see characterset from wchar t we developed a toolkit running on the x window system the toolkit copes with any languages based on x r s i n facility as you know there are kinds of i n implementation from mit s x r release xsi and ximp our original implementation of the toolkit uses xsi our toolkit manages each character s size based on our own font management system in order to do that the wchar t typed character strings must be decomposed to character sets this means that if one wchar t type compound string with ascii and kanji mixed for example is given each element of the wchar t array must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout and application environment s locale in this case if the locale is japanese each wchar t character will be classified either to iso jisx or so we need a function to do this the function must check how many characters from the top are the same character set and what the character set is we could not find any public x r function to do that and inevitably used xsi s internal functions to construct that function the following is the source code of that function decomposecharacterset i n h this may look like c code but it is really c id i n h v iima exp iima ifndef i n h define i n h include x xlib h extern int decomposecharacterset const wchar t wc str in int wc len in char buf out int buflen in out int scanned len out char charset out extern xmstring wchartoxmstring const wchar t wc str extern xmstringcharset charsetofwchar const wchar t wc endif i n h i n cc id i n cc v iima exp include stdlib h include x xlibint h include xm xm h include i n h extern c include x wchar h define xwcdecomposeglyphcharset xxx xwcdecomposeglyphcharset define xmbfscs xxx xmbfscs define xmbctidtocsid xxx xmbctidtocsid include xlocaleint h undef xwcdecomposeglyphcharset undef xmbfscs undef xmbctidtocsid extern int xwcdecomposeglyphcharset xlocale const wchar t int char int int int extern charset xmbfscs xlocale csid extern csid xmbctidtocsid xlocale csid int decomposecharacterset const wchar t wc str in int wc len in char buf out int buf len in out int scanned len out char charset out xlocale xlocale xfallbackconvert int ctid int status charset xcharset status xwcdecomposeglyphcharset xlocale wc str wc len buf buf len scanned len ctid if status success xcharset xmbfscs xlocale xmbctidtocsid xlocale ctid charset xcharset xcharset cs name null else charset null return status an included file above xlocaleint h is also xsi internal and we copied the file to the toolkit directory and compiled a serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on our hp machine with its os version of hp ux when we tried to link an application based on our toolkit link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing xmbctidtocsid code xmbfscs code xwcdecomposeglyphcharset code xfallbackconvert code we had used mit release version of x r and its xsi implementation until hp up and ran applications successfully one of the reasons to use xsi was that because hp did not release hp s x r until the os and we had no way to know how hp s r would be implemented we had hoped xsi s popularity and used its internal functions the hp s linker complains that there are no xsi internal functions implemented we observe from hp s libx a they used some ximp implementation but we are not sure if they used mit s vanilla ximp version or their own version of ximp and therefore finding just counter part functions in mit s ximp for xsi does not seem to lead us a solution my question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like decomposecharacterset listed above is there any function to check character set of each element of wchar t type strings depending on locales if it is a public function that is perfect but even if it is not we want to use any internal functions in hp s x r as we did for mit s r in order to render a wchar t type string there must be some machinery to judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for the string we have no way to find out that without any hp s x r source files we want to know how we can use that for our goal any help or comments would be highly appreciated i also appreciate if anyone tell me about ximp treating around this area even if it is not hp s implementation thank you takeshi inoue inoue crd yokogawa co jp yokogawa electric corporation open systems laboratory

x interactive performance we recently got an ncd x terminal to evaluate this is running xremote over a serial line i wanted to get some measurement of response time so i wrote a small xlib program which simply creates a window maps it and sends the first expose event to itself the program times the delay from sending the event to receiving it i thought this was the simplest way to test client x server round trip delays it s a similar concept to the ping c program is this a valid test to perform i ve also tried the xbench program available from ftp uu net which bombards the server with graphics operations but i just wanted to get a quantative measure of what is acceptable interactive response time has anyone got any ideas on this subject thanks andrew afielden mlsma att com andrew fielden at t network systems uk tel information systems group sun support email afielden mlsma att com

input focus to a window other than where the pointer is i have noticed in framemaker x on both the sgi and sun platforms that certain dialogs such as column layout for example respond to keyboard traversal even though the pointer is not in the dialog window and even though the window manager keyboard focus policy is pointer how is this done i would like to emulate this behavior in my application it seems a reasonable behavior since when a dialog is popped up from a keyboard action the dialog is not guaranteed to be under the pointer and the user should not have to reach for the mouse just to move the focus alternatively i m open to any suggestions as to what is the right way to insure that popups get the focus when they appear particularly when they are invoked from the keyboard and one s keyboard focus policy is pointer allen barnett whose wife graciously allowed to use her account

keyboard mapping and window placement questions these are two common subjects so i hope someone has had to deal with these specific questions if my application depends on modifiers what is the best lookup method my choices are to call xgetmodifiermapping for each key press with a modifier or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers in a lookup table i would like to do it the second way but i can t seem to get the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers i know that when an app calls xsetmodifiermapping a mappingnotify event is generated non maskable which i can pick up and modify my internal table but i don t seem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap if i use xt all o reilly has to say is is automatically handled by xt if i use xlib ala xnextevent i get nothing this all stems from problems with users of the sun keyboard and the numlock plus various alt meta etc modifier requirements i would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right of my main window i want it at the same y coord and their right left sides touching what i need to ask for is the x y coord of the window manager s border for the main window this should ring a bell with anyone who has called xtmovewidget immediately checking the x y after the move and seeing that it is right and in their next callback asking for the x y and seeing that it is now offset by the wm border any help would be most appreciated darcy darcy mccallum mentorg com
save under with x r i have the following problem on x r servers when a window of my is obscured by a pop up window which has the save under attribute set the subwindows of my window are not restored normally the subwindows are redrawn when the parent window gets an expose event but because the save under attribute is used for the pop up window that obscured my window no expose event is sent when exposuremask is set for the child windows those windows are correctly updated when the popup window disappears however then the application gets too many expose events and you see extra redraws everything works fine with x r is this something that is changed between x r and x r obvious is it something i do wrong is there something that the popup window should do which is also mine is this a bug in x release greetings hans bos domain hans xelion nl xelion bv uucp sun nl xelion hans postbus phone

for sale waxworks pc game for sale waxworks by horrorsoft accolade by the same folks who brought you elvira i ii i played elvira i ii and think that horrorsoft has finally made a very playable game with waxworks the look and feel is roughly the same as in the elvira games though the real time fighting is a little easier to survive the first two games especially elvira ii jaws of cerberus made it very tough to stay alive and hit point restoring was very difficult this is not to say that waxworks is a walk in the park but it is quite fair in that there is always some weapon to be found that is quite effective or hint given as to the proper fighting strategy in one of the four wax works to be explored there is no fighting at all well almost none though all four contain moderately challanging puzzles the really interesting thing about this game is that it is really broken up into four seperate rpgs one for each of the four exhibits you must enter in starting each one your character is transported with no objects to use and experience level one exhibits traps you inside a multi level ancient egyptian pyramid which you must escape by fighting mapping and puzzle solving another exhibit traps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines and pods while the local humans have been transformed into plant zombies this is a single level maze that requires you to rescue some humans kill the head plant alien and figuere out how to kill the very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up this is perhaps the most horrifying exhibit another exhibit puts you into jack the ripper england where you appear by the corpse of a fresh ripper victim and of course the police think you are responsible you must avoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of the ripper and meet him face to face but first get a disquise the last exhibit pus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to stop the almost indestructible zombies over all the vga graphics and music are very effective in setting a creepy tone for the game as was the case for the elvira games though gameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game i heartily recommend it for rpg and horror fans all prices include shipping all games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated us buyers only please all games will be shipped inside a box with packing insured priority usps all games include all original materials including box manual disks and registration unless otherwise noted the first responder offering asking price is guarenteed to get the game those just asking questions get no priority until they offer to buy the game lower offers may be considered assuming no other offers at asking price are made sam bauer hewlett packard co network test division smb col hp com colorado springs co

tcd d dat walkman for sale i recently backed out of purchasing an almost unused sony tcd d dat walkman having found someone else who has a unit i personally prefer and am paying more for however it s still a heck of a machine for the price it is quite rugged and many people out there swear by it it s probably the most popular walkman style dat machine out there anyway the guy selling it is bryan davis bdavis netcom com and here s what he told me here is what is included tcd d datman rca to stereo plug cables one for analog input one for analog output optical digital i o cable one lead for input one for output a copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase the unit is still under factory warrantee ac adaptor battery charger rechargable battery i paid tax for it so i hope you don t mind if i keep the minute tape it came with i have some samples on it by the way he spent at least too much for it unless he s including an extended warranty which is advised for dat machines since it costs about to replace the head when it wears out and it probably will within years if you use it a lot davisonj i m not going to quote my sale price for him that would not be nice send him mail and ask him what he wants again i ve used the tcd d and i have to say that i can certainly understand why it is as popular as it is i ve been using one for a little while and although i had some problems with it recently i should also point out that the particular one i was using had been on the road for two years and had truly been used during that time this is the same exact dat machine that was lugged around the u s and canada to record the jazz butcher conspiracy for their recent live album bryan davis says i know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labels in s f who use that model and have been for a while with no reported problem my problem is that everyone i know already has one nuff said the reason i m not getting it is that i found someone else selling me a unit that features phono plug spdif i o instead of optical i don t have any optical ports on my equipment but you the reader might and it also has some other bells whistles that the tcd d doesn t i am also paying more for the alternative note that phono plug to optical spdif adapters are available if you absolutely must have one of course it has scms all consumer decks do so do sony minidiscs by the way anyway if you re interested get in touch with bdavis netcom com john davison davisonj ecn purdue edu
