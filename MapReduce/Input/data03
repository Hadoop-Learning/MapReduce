vandalizing the sky dale sez mr hathaway s post is right on the money if a little lengthy in short an orbiting billboard would be trash in the same way that a billboard on the earth is trash billboards make a place look trashy that is why there are laws in many places prohibiting their use the light pollution complaints are mainly an attempt to find some tangible reason to be against orbiting billboards because people don t feel morally justified to complain on the grounds that these things would defile the beauty of the sky i don t buy it if the things had no value at all people wouldn t spend money to make them so their lack of value is just your opinion not an actual fact which is neither a philisophical or legal basis for prohibiting them on the other hand i lived in oakbrook il for a while where zoning laws prohibit billboards as you mention above i think it was a fine law despite it s contradictory basis i would guess that the best legal and moral basis for protest would be violation of private property i bought this house out in the boondocks specifically to enjoy my hobby amateur astronomy now this billboard has made that investment worthless so i want the price of the property in damages it wouldn t take too many succesful cases like that to make bill sats prohibitively expensive tommy mac tom mcwilliams wk they communicated with the communists tm ibm cl msu edu hm and pacified the pacifists timbuk

u s government and science and technolgy investment in article apr aio jsc nasa gov kjenks gothamcity jsc nasa gov writes people who criticize big government and its projects rarely seem to have a consistent view of the role of government in science and technology basically the u s government has gotten into the role of supporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too long term historically this role for the u s gov t was forced upon it because of socialism in other countries in order for u s industries to compete with government subsidized foreign competitors the u s gov t has taken on the role of subisizing big ticket or long lead r d this definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government into the support of science some of it is relevant in technology there was little involvement of federal funds or except through support of state universities of state funds for scientific research before wwii the us research position had been growing steadily and the funding was mainly from university and private foundation funds there were not that many research universities but they all provided their researchers with low teaching loads laboratories assistants and equipment and funds for travel to scientific meetings not that much but it was provided and a university wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well as salary during wwii the military and the defense departments found that pure scientists could do quite well with their problems even though they were not exactly in the areas of the scientists expertise this is probably because of the research mind approach which is not to try to find a solution but to understand the problem and see if a solution emerges this works in stages and as research scientists were used to discussion about their problems the job got done the military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the future and started funding pure research after wwii but congress was unwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the future supply of scientists and set up other organizations such as nsf to do the job it also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly keep politics out also the government did a job on private foundations making it more difficult for them to act to support research the worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which the government supports research the university will not provide funding and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money suppose as has been the case i have a project which could use the assistance of a graduate student for a few months what do you think happens if i ask for one the answer i will get is get the money from nsf now the money at the university level is a few thousand but at the nsf level it comes to about thousand and is likely to keep a faculty member from getting supported so the government is in effect deciding which projects get supported and how much also the government decided that the wealth should be spread so instead of having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research institutions the idea that more schools should get into the act came into being and instead of evaluating scholars they had to go to evaluating reseach proposals as a researcher i can tell you that any research proposal has to be mainly wishful thinking or as now happens the investigator conceals already done work to release it as the results of the research what i am proposing today i may solve before the funding is granted i may find impossible or i may find that it is too difficult in addition tomorrow i may get unexpected research results possibly i may bet a bright idea which solves yesterday s too difficult problem or a whole new approach to something i had not considered can develop this is the nature of the beast and except for really vague statements if something can be predicted it is not major research but development or routine activity not requiring more than minimal attention of a good researcher i believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would have happened if the government had never gotten into it and the government is trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders herman rubin dept of statistics purdue univ west lafayette in phone hrubin snap stat purdue edu internet bitnet purdue pur ee snap stat hrubin uucp

re vandalizing the sky rbunge access digex net robert bunge writes that s fine idea but it only works if the lighting power company even bothers to supply good light fixtures for instance a power company in virginia recently asked a state commission for permission to sell more lights of various type yet all of the different fixture that they sold and wanted to sell uh why do they have to ask a state commision unless the state s buying such a process will only increace the overhead to the power company of selling different types of light and will decreace the likleihood that they will do so and any efficient lights they might have been planning in the future go down the drain were bad designs one that wasted the light thus you couldn t even buy a good light from them in most places to get a good light you have to either order it special at high cost or call a store in arizona you could order it special if enough people did so it would be low cost last i checked you could use ups to buy stuff in arizona before going there finally i m sure your state has things like small factories and machine shops you could go into business making lights that are cheaper to use thanks to their higher efficiency and the fact that they aren t wasting energy on broadcasting to space and therefore better than the old style at some point society starts to make rules cars have to pass safety tests five year plans have to be enacted or the planning for the economy will fall apart companies have to meet pollution standards etc as if the clean air act really cleaned up the air there are two ways to achieve this educate the public so that they demand good lighting or force code down the lighting companies backs history seems to suggest that the latter is more likely to work my experience seems to suggest that you re trying too hard to educate them with the same methods used in american schools to make any subject whatsoever as relevant and boring as proto ugric instead of selling them on the idea agreed so i won t respond again it s important for all you spacers out there to realize that some people will object to various wild ideas that have been presented just like congress it would be best to consult the astronomers lovers of the night sky before you try some pr stunt to boost public knowledge about space well wake up space is becoming a field of human endeavor instead of just something we can look at from a long long way away there are practical space projects that could conceivably although probably not cause lots of light pollution and have been argued against on those grounds even though they might open up such possibilities that people could vacation on mars if they wanted really dark skies bob bunge rbunge access digex com phil fraering seems like every day we find out all sorts of stuff pgf srl cacs usl edu like how the ancient mayans had televison repo man

re over zealous shuttle critics khayash hsc usc edu ken hayashida writes rockwell international in downey california in conjunction with the other shuttle contractors delivered the world s most important and most revolutionary space vehicle ha one cannot argue with the fact that it flies lands and is reusable watch me it flies it lands it gets rebuilt in my opinion these were the only appropriate specifications for this program that s not what they told us back in the s it has been a test program from the start a logical follow to the x program and the later x series lifting bodies it isn t a logical follow on a logical follow on would have been either a russian snowfox type thingey for the lifting bodies or something like mmi s space van or boeing s tsto or the airbreathing tsto the military is allegedly using now that probably cost less to develop than the shuttle does to fly for a year the engineering specs that the guys in the trenches had were to develop a system which was man ratable could land reliably and could be reflown these goals were quite visionary for the s and i would argue that they are challenging even today including for the dc x program keep that attitude and it ll be a couple centuries before we get real access to space unless another country without all that baggage comes along and kicks our ass in the space race i do not recall a flight week specification in the final nasa specs for the space shuttle program if you have such documents i would find them most revealing and interesting as far as i can tell the only people touting a flight per week flight rate were people on capitol hill or selling books to the general public or nasa hq that doesn t give the rest of the program plausible deniability if we deceide that it wasn t worth the money we ve spent which is by now probably a lot more than apollo imho political statements in the halls of the us congress are not admissable as engineering specs because specs should be determined by nasa dod and contractors not by congressmen senators or presidents missions are defined by political leaders but not the engineering specs yes but it gets sold on the basis of the political statements you re saying basically that it met the engineering specs which is questionable imho so it s a success never mind that you couldn t get the funding the shuttle eats with those engineering specs in a thousand years the shuttle is the only reusable space vehicle this automatically qualifies it as an unparalleled engineering success you could argue about its political success but engineering wise it is clearly the most advanced machine ever flown i argue that engineering and technical data for hypersonic flight is valuable in and of itself shuttle should be justified or criticized on the basis of economics you can get hypersonic flight data with an x or a follow on x type vehicle for much less and economics and engineering are interchangable engineering in the absense of economics is basically just physics and in terms of physics the shuttle looks like a failure next to the x then henry wrote hs sorry support that i can arrange for launchers all goes to launchers hs that i have some hope of riding some day at the moment that s hs dc x s hoped for successors i was disappointed by this and other similar statements from those vocal in support of the dc x program your support of dc x is based on hopes my support for the shuttle program is based on record the shuttle program has a bad record i once had hopes for the shuttle program by now i know those hopes were false all i have for dc x and similar and dissimilar experimental vehicles are hopes but at least i know they aren t false hopes yet i did support the shuttle way back when it didn t do nearly what it was supposed to it s time to move on to something that might do the job of orbital delivery better or at all i think that it is also important to note that i do not object to dc x it is visionary i originally posted i like the dc x idea and i am really hopeful that it ll be a stunning success unfortunately dc x ers are not willing to return that support the proven shuttle program explain why you folks criticize shuttle when shuttle is exactly what you guys need in order to learn how to operate dc x on orbit we don t want to learn how to operate on orbit it launches it shoves out the payload it lands it doesn t waste payload hauling up and down edo pallets and the like the only thing to be learned from shuttle is how not to build a launcher finally that bit about the proven shuttle are you hoping you can tell a lie enough times and get someone to believe it i enjoyed your later postings regarding the comparisons between the shuttle and the soyuz project although i may disagree with your method of analysis you probably will disagree with mine i think that the total impact of the shuttle program must be judged on the scientific and technical merit not on timelines and schedules do you agree how much science and technology could have been done is the money spent on shuttle had been spent differently as for now we need to stop thinking of dc x and

re life on mars in article lv fpoinnqo exodus eng sun com jmck norge eng sun com john mckernan writes some new information has been discovered recently microscopic fossils have been found in very old rocks the theory is that this life is so old that it must have been destroyed during the periodic intense meteorite bombardments that were a feature of the early solar system under this theory life originated on earth multiple times between multiple meteorite bombardments and therefore the conditions for the creation of life cannot be that unlikely this was all badly reported in the news there is no evidence that signs of life found in old rock predate putative planet sterilizing events rather the argument was that if life arose shortly the last sterilizing event then it must be easily formed the inference was that life originated before and was destroyed but there was no evidence of that however even this argument is flawed it could well be that origin of life requires specific conditions say a certain composition of the atmosphere that do not last for long so perhaps life formed early only because it would have had no other chance to do so not because it was likely that life would originate under those conditions paul f dietz dietz cs rochester edu

shuttle and pennicillin pennicillin if i have everything correct was a highly valuable myco toxin discovered during ww it proved to have an amazing bacterio cidal effect without human toxicity it s immediate administration showed immediate dramatic results solving problems that previously were fatal although initially enormously expensive to culture within years the price had fallen at least two orders of magnitude and within years was not much more expensive then aspirin penicillin was also usable for an amazingly wide class of infections centoxin is a drug that is not passing fda approval it promised amazing results for toxic shock a rapidly fatal disease it consumed enormous amounts of funding in testing and developement however it works less then in times of administration and costs per administration with no promise of any reduction in manufacturing cost the drug thus costs per useful case and is implicated in a slight increase in mortality for some patients i would not dare to compare the shuttle to pennicillin but to centoxin pat

re philosophy quest how boldly in article sti kinnoq gap caltech edu palmer cco caltech edu david m palmer writes gary ke zv uucp gary coffman writes lack of a skeleton means that muscles have to actively resist gravity at all times on land rather than supplying only balancing forces that means that much more energy would be required for the creature to function the bones also supply leverage points for pushing and lateral movement that s why you don t find large active boneless creatures on land hydraulics can make rigid tubes no energy required just for support hydraulics also allow a creature to produce large forces with weak muscles using the principle of a hydraulic jack rather than a lever this is one of those yes but things it s true that a hydraulically pressurized tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressurized tube but even at psi levels a hydraulic hose will bend rather easily though it s straight on compressive strength is high and it s torsional resistance increase is practically nil on the other grasping member there s no doubt that hydraulic leverage exists in nature tree roots are an example given time they can shatter concrete as osmotic pressure increases it s interesting to note that on land creatures are either two legged or legged with tiny insects having or legs but never legged though that would be a stable configuration it can be argued that legged creatures kangaroos are legged the specific number of limbs a creature has is an accident of evolution it is hard to make changes in some structures the panda has a thumb plus as many fingers as its ancestors five on each hand but the thumb is a modified wristbone rather than a modified finger and extra fingers are much more common than extra limbs especially fully functional ones kangaroos limbed i don t think so if you take the view that the tail is a limb then monkeys and kangaroos are limbed i think the tail is a different kind of structure grossly enlarged in the case of the kangaroo but primarily still an instrument of balance rather than locomotion i don t know much about panda thumbs so i ll ask is it opposable thermodynamic considerations of surface volume relationships would seem to dictate that active complex creatures stay in a size range similar to what we see about us inch tall intelligent aliens seem unlikely as do those much larger than the elephant why can t a lemur or a brontosaurus be intelligent yes i know that the brontosaurus is a mythical beast produced by putting the head of another dinosaur on an apatosaurus but so far space aliens are also mythical well i won t say flat out that they can t be intelligent but i ll bring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why i don t think it s likely first let me say that when i say intelligent i mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level with or greater than human tool use and tool building ie assuming suitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter it s enviroment in a planned way it will do so that s certainly not a universal or complete definition of intelligence but it will suffice for a putative technological alien now no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought but it s generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level of complexity this is generally determined by the number of neuron cells and their interconnections so a creature the size of a lemur wouldn t have enough neurons to support complex thought this argument is considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur there s room for a large brain though no indication that one ever developed one reason this may be true is neuronic speed the electrochemical messages that trigger neurons require time to propagate this makes it difficult for a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very large creatures so there s little selection pressure for such brains instead a simpler distributed network evolves this doesn t rule out intelligent dinosaurs but it points in that direction then there are the thermodynamic arguments a tiny creature like the lemur needs to eat frequently because it s internal heat is rapidly lost due to it s high surface to volume ratio i contend that a creature that must spend most of it s time and energy feeding won t have the time to develop and exercise intelligence that argument may be somewhat weak the dinosaur s problem is the reverse it must moderate it s heat production because it s high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat i m assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical reactivity reasons for productive neuron function so creatures would tend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that of humans if they are carbon based that tends to rule out cold blooded creatures as potential homes of intelligence some people contend that some of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded but for a creature the size of a brontosaur it s activity levels would have to be restrained or it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the waste heat whales are similar size but they can reject heat to the ocean a much more efficient sink than air i suspect that for intelligence to manifest itself a certain degree of activity in interacting with the environment is necessary ie monkey curiousity i doubt a large dinosaur would be capable of that much activity gary gary coffman ke zv you make it gatech wa mei ke zv gary destructive testing

an international organi sation was found in in qadian india the founder of this movement hazrat mirza ghulam ahmad was proclaimed to be the promised reformer of this age as foretold in the scriptures of almost all major religions of the world he claimed to be the fulfillment of the long awaited second comming of jesus christ metaphorically the muslim mahdi and the promised messiah the claims of hazrat ahmad raised storms of hostility and extreme opposition which are often witnessed in the history of divine reformers even today this sect is being persecuted especial ly in some of the muslim regimes the right of ahmadi muslims to openly practice their religion and to define themselves as muslims has been severely restricted in many muslim countries the united nations human rights organizations such as amnesty international and top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns against this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the members of this movement but

re homosexuality issues in christianity bruce liv ac uk bruce stephens suggests different levels of acceptance of homosexuality regard homosexual orientation as a sin or evil whatever regard homosexual behaviour as a sin but accept orientation though presumably orientation is unfortunate and dislike people who indulge as but love the sinner accept homosexuality altogether i would add our churches should accept homosexual orientation but hold all people to certain standards of sexual behavior promiscuity abuse of power relationships harrassment compulsivity are equally out of place in the lives of homosexual as of heterosexual people of course this would bring up the dread shibboleth of homosexual marriage and we couldn t have that billh
re ethnicity in worship jerryl payne writes to sublimate a culture for the sake of what you perceive as unity seems antithetical to the very message of inclusion that you preach i agree with the exception that i don t preach ignoring our cultures the body as a whole must be unified the question is shall we be a melting pot boiling ourselves down to one legitimate expression or shall we be more like a stew maintaining the textural integrity of the expressed diversity while upholding the unity of thought it released all churches from the use of the latin mass unity to allow them to speak to the people in the common language diversity in revelation we see that in the first century church there was one congregation in each major city so there was one unified church now in each city there were people of different cultures naturally they formed something of a stew with different members having different heritages nevertheless they were one body they met together sometimes as smaller groups in their homes and sometimes in bigger groups in places such as the temple courts now in a particular city then and now you will find that there is a common language associated with that region for instance in rome latin was spoken in the united states today english is spoken so it would make sense that congregations in different cities would speak the common language and not necessarily latin naturally you would expect the lead evangelist to preach in the common language in the first century church there were probably many people in the congregation who could speak a given tongue to translate the message for people of foreign ethnic groups today however you don t see people speaking in tongues to translate sermons even in so called pentacostal churches we do have a modern day equivalent though bi lingual speakers now in the unified church of which i am a member sometimes called the international churches of christ when we all meet together on sundays there are headphones on people who don t speak english from which they hear an ongoing translation of the sermon in their native tongue neat idea huh now we meet in different size groups in a random sort of way on sundays so sometimes there will be a meeting of only haitians or of spanish speaking people for example who will hear an evangelist preach in their native language in addition we meet in small groups a couple of times during the week for bible discussion groups and devotionals so someone who speaks a different language will almost always be with people who also speak his language assuming the congregation is large enough for those meetings as for the people who speak the common language they can keep in touch with their culture if they want but they will also have equally deep friendships among their church relationships with people of many various nationalities has the purpose of the church been thwarted by this action the action of letting catholics worship in a native language instead of latin indeed not see my second paragraph in response to the second clipping of your article however if you mean the action of forming denominations based on a culture then the purpose of the church has been indeed thwarted i ll assume the second possiblility when answering your next clipping rather i believe it has been enhanced for paul exhorts us to become as one of them that we might reach them thus if a person or group of people feel more comfortable among their own shall we not give them a place where they can feel comfortable with their heritage and still l ove god my guess aaron you have met some needs of people certainly by helping them to be proud of their cultural heritages when most denominations didn t yet you have largely isolated yourselves from having quality christian friendships outside your nationality and your denomination we shall certainly give people a place to feel comfortable with their heritage however we will do this in a way that does not destroy church unity but rather encourages friendships among all disciples this is the approach of some of the groups that you cite it sounds like these groups have wonderful intentions but they are going about things in the wrong way and names like the african methodist episcopal church still make me cringe although not as much as before i understand that there was more racism in the past that caused such groups to be formed but now we should try to unite i know that it s hard for many people on this newsgroup to imagine there being only one body of people on earth but it is quite possible and i am working to make it happen however what might be a smaller step towards unity would be taking the word african out of your denomination s name then perhaps someday a long time off you can also remove the methodist episcopal part also and simply be part of the church with regard to inclusivity i note tht your sig emits from mit as you know the tute is religiously and culturally diversified and not everyone who comes there is immediately comfortable with english much less american culture what shall be the conduct of the campus churches then shall there be one church for the sake of unity or shall the organizations like kcf be useful in helping students new to america make the transition in culture language and thought there shall be one church for the sake of unity and it shall be useful in helping students new to america make the transition in culture language and thought we shouldn t make a new denomination to try to solve problems the whole denominational mindset only causes more problems sadly in the ame church we retain african cutlure at the root of our expression but we are by no means exclusive since you live in cambridge i invite you to visit the local assembly there thank you for the invitation that shows me that you indeed have the heart to spread the gospel of jesus as well as take part in your cultural heritage thank you also for responding to my post i know all too well how they can be very time consuming the whole idea of celebrating your culture is paved with good intentions but i still feel that you must restore and preserve unity at the same time my own church the boston church has the acapella singing that you mentioned in your post yet doesn t limit expression of my mexican culture even though i am in the mit campus ministry and not the spanish speaking zone i have made a commitment to god that i will go to the sunday services of my church because i know that my brothers and sisters here are fully devoted in love for god as his disciples i don t believe in tongues as you may have already picked up on because of my understanding of biblical christianity however i am certainly willing to visit your congregation provided that it doesn t interfere with my normal worship since you also live in cambridge i also extend an invitation to you to visit our services as often as you like you can meet the mit students at the student center across from mass ave at am on sundays to leave for worship or simply call me after wednesday night to find out where the service will be held on a particular day my number is but will be in a few weeks from now and for the rest of the summer our service normally last from am to noon but occasionally are later or earlier times per year let us always strive to reach all with the gospel by any means necessary as we move from milk to meat the petty things of the world that temporally separate us will dissolve away and we shall stand with our naked realizations that god has shed

re mary s assumption in article may athos rutgers edu brian finnerty bfinnert chaph usc edu writes one last point an ex catholic attempted to explain catholic doctrine on the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that mary did not die this is not a correct summary of what catholics believe the dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying whether mary did or did not die in fact the consensus among catholic theologians seems to be that mary in fact did die this would make sense christ died and his mother who waited at the foot of the cross would want to share in his death the above article is a good short summary of traditional christian teaching concerning the death of mary also very good is re question about the virgin mary by micheal d walker he tells the story very well i would like to add that in the eastern orthodox church we celebrate the dormition or falling asleep of the theotokos the mother of god the icon for this day shows mary lying on a bed surrounded by the apostles who are weeping christ in his resurrected glory is there holding what seems to be a small child this is in fact mary s soul already with christ in heaven the assumption of mary is one more confirmation for us as christians that christ did indeed conquer death it forshadows the general resurrection on the last day the disciples were not surprised to find mary s body missing from the grave she was the mother of the savior she was the first of all christians she gave birth to the word of god if it were not for her we would not be saved this is why we pray in the orthodox church through the prayers of the theotokos savior save us timothy richardson rich student tc umn edu

re how i got saved well i was certainly turned off by that first paragraph of oft used platitudes i can t count the times i ve heard those common tactics anymore you may not believe it but that doesn t change the fact that it s true the old analogy about trusting your parents sheesh need i point out how parents can show children that they are right that difference in capability alone crushes that analogy as any facts about christianity i have seen turned out to be beliefs what i seek is fact knowledge if i can get it and evidence for a belief if i can t so far from christians i have received neither before becoming a christian i too had problems when i asked one to explain it to me the actual evidence is not always what you see on a person s outside it should be but is not always a very specific somewhat miraculous example of the truth of god working to help his followers is soemthing that happened to me for nearly years after an accident i had severe complications from a triple fracture in my left leg and surgery pins put in then removed the bone itself was perfectly healed no infectoin that could be detected yet i was in constant pain and it my ankle and foot were always swollen and bluish more complicatios developed in my other leg none of which could be explained by the best specialists and most sophisticated tests in te northern illinois region we went everywhere no one could explain it durin gthat summer june to be exact i gave my life and heart to christ and vowed to relinquish control over my life which i never really had anyway because of what he did for me on the cross and the fact that my whole life was screwed up by me trying to fix it i was facing the possibility of a lifetime in a wheelchair i was confined to one in order to save my legs from any further damage since the cause of my problems were unknown had been in it for about months before that day i found it ore than coincidental that less than weeks after i put my faith where my mouth was one more in the long line of doctors and not even an orthopeodic specialist diagnosed my problems with no difficulty set me on the path to an effective cure and i was walking and running again without the pain that had stopped me from that for years the diagnosis was something he felt the other doctors must have overlooked because it was perfectly obvious from my test results maybe this doesn t hit you as miraculous but to me it really is imagine an active year old being told she may not be able to walk mcuh longer and is now a happy year old who can dance and run knowing that the problem was there all along and was revealed just after she did what she knew was right as the song says our god is an awesome god

re the doctrine of original sin regarding the consequences of the original sin catholics believe that what adam primarily lost by his sin for himself and the human race was sanctifying grace this is basically a share in the divine life take a rock and make it able to talk what god does to a human being through sanctifying grace is similar it makes such a one able to live on a plane that is above the powers of any possible creature this is the everlasting life that the new testament speaks of what christ did when he came was to restore this life of sanctifying grace to the human race he instituted the sacraments as the means by which this life is given to people and its increase fostered the absence of sanctifying grace at death means automatic exclusion from heaven the nature of heaven is such that it s impossible for a human being to have any part in it without the gift of sanctifying grace to use my example it would be like taking that rock and attempting to hold a conversation with it rocks cannot talk neither can human beings live in heaven without sanctifying grace this all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults since both have souls infants must be baptized therefore or they cannot enter into heaven they too need this form of life in them or they cannot enter into heaven turning it around infant baptism is good supporting evidence for the catholic belief in sanctifying grace unless baptism causes some change in an infant s soul there is no particular reason to insist on the practice yet infant baptism was probably practiced by the apostles themselves and was certainly part of the church shortly thereafter there is evidence for infant baptism in the new testament itself cor acts also acts it is known for sure that at least one disciple of the apostle john was baptized as an infant st polycarp because of a remark he makes in the acts of his martyrdom st justin martyr mentions men and women baptized as infants there is direct evidence in st irenaeus s against heresies and in tertullian s on baptism all these so far mentioned are in the first years after our lord s death after that there starts to be tons of evidence for the practice
the ancient canon of the roman rite the following is a juxtaposition of part of an ancient text known as de sacramentis usually attributed to st ambrose of milan and the canon of the traditional catholic mass of the roman rite the conclusion from this comparison is that the central part of the traditional roman canon was already fairly well in place by sometime in the late th century taken from the mass of the western rites by the right reverend dom fernand cabrol abbot of farnborough without permission excerpted from chapter vi the mass at rome from the fifth to the seventh centuries the paragraph at the end is from the book not me sorry about the long lines joe buehler text of de sacramentis roman canon roman canon about ad ad english translation te igitur omitted here memento

thy holy angel unto thy majestatis tuae etc altar above before the face of thy divine majesty etc there is no doubt that we have here two editions of the same text and as that of de sacramentis is localised in upper italy and dated about the year it is the most ancient witness we possess as to the principal parts of the roman canon which only appear in the sacramentaries some time after the seventh century the question as to whether the roman canon is not older even than that of de sacramentis is discussed by liturgiologists mgr batiffol is of this opinion but we on the contrary think that the former bears traces of closer composition of a more carefully guarded orthodoxy and that consequently it is a text corrected from de sacramentis we shall see in studying the list of names in the memento of the living and that of the dead that mgr batiffol argues with good reason that he can date these fragments from the pontificate of symmachus we thus have the state of the roman mass or at least of the chief parts of the canon at the beginning of the fourth century
re why do people become atheists in article may athos rutgers edu fil sapienza med umich edu fil sapienza writes i am interested in finding out why people become atheists after having believed in some god god in conversing with them on other groups i ve often sensed anger or hostility though i don t mean to imply that all atheists are angry or hostile it does seem to be one motivation for giving up faith thus some atheism might result from broken ness i d like to field this one if i may although i am a believer in and follower of christ my experiences with religion haven t been all that positive in fact there was one point in my life when for about three days i simply couldn t believe in the existence of god anyway when i look back upon the troubles i ve had they seem to fall into two categories impulses to unbelief that resulted from logical contradictions and impulses to unbelief that resulted from frustration with god the first category doesn t occur to me much anymore as i have worked through most of the arguments for the non existence of god but way back when these would cause me some problems and i would have to struggle with my faith to continue to believe i can see where others less stubborn than i and i do mean stubborn stubborness has often been the only thing standing between me an atheism from time to time would fail the second category arises out of some long term personal difficulties and the struggle to live my life as god would have me live it without living my life as others would tell me how god would have me live it a good example of this is my struggle with the more radical christians i meet i am not nor have i ever been on fire for chirst and i don t think i ever want to be nevertheless i am not lukewarm about my faith so i don t really fit in with the mainstream either quite naturally i feel a lot of anxiety about my dislocation within christian society and it can lead to a lot of internal tension when i want to do what i know is right but when another part of me believes that what i want to do is wrong because all the other christians think so to quite naturally this tension has a destructive effect on my relationship with god and during all of this internal strife there s atheism sitting there like the promised land no rules no responsibilities no need to live up to anyone s expectations but my own complete freedom of course it s all an illusion but nevertheless it s a very appealing illusion especially when the so called people of god are behaving like total twits i can easily understand why someone would go that route and would be hostile to ever coming back imho many of the former christians turned atheists who are now actively hostile to christianity are so because their experience with christ and god wasn t a very peaceful one but one of mind control and shut up and do what you re told because we know what s best for you because it s god s will and you re to young to know what god s will is yet courtesy of some of christ s more overzealous followers a final reason why people become atheists is because christians do not have a very good reputation right now one of the things that attracted people to christianity in the ancient days was the love that christians obviously had for one another and the world around them unlike the rest of the world christian communities actively cared for their poor and the christian rich did not trod on the backs of their poorer brothers but bent down to help them christians were known for living exemplary lives even if they were thought to be traitors to the state because they wouldn t sacrifice to the emporer nowadays courtesy of the media and some christian leaders who lost christ on their way to power people see christians as sexually repressed hippocritical busibodies who want to remake society into a facist version of their own moral view there are a lot more reasons why people become atheists but i don t have time to go into them right now tom ault
re god morality and massacres jek cu nih gov james kiefer writes stuff deleted first point what they are doing is wrong just as what joseph s brothers did was wrong just as what judas did was wrong they intend it for evil if god somehow brings good out of it that does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and punishment second point of course god will bring good out of it but not the same good that he would have brought if the serbians had refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder nor does the good he purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right so what you re saying then is that god exercises direct control or influence upon humanity he doesn t control our every thought or action but takes what we do whether it be intended for evil or not and turns it into something good it seems to me that this idea conflicts with the belief that god gave humans free will as far as i can determine it is impossible to reconcile these two different ideas if god were to exert his influence upon anyone or anything at anytime he would be impeding upon someone s free will unless of course you believe that god did not give us complete and unabated free will but rather some sort of conditional free will something that allows us to make our own choices and control our own lives except when god wants to use us to fulfill some good purpose of his own by hardening our heart or controlling us in some other way i hear alot of people who look at various events mostly catastrophies or things like the aids epidemic and make comments about god s will i have a very difficult time understanding why people believe that god controls anything that happens on this planet except possibly when being asked to through someone s prayer according to the bible pharoah was going to let moses people go after one or two plagues but god kept hardening his heart so moses could cast all plagues upon the egyptians the last plague causing the death of many innocent children so then god impeded upon pharoah s free will and used him as a puppet god did this not just to free the hebrews but to free them in some sort of a grand fashion i suppose from the hebrew s point of view this could be seen as turning something bad into good but i m sure the egyptians didn t see it this way all of your examples of how god turned something bad into something good are based upon showing favortism to one group of people over another after all it s only good based upon your point of view why does god who is supposed to be the god of all of humanity play favorites

re homosexuality issues in christianity in article may athos rutgers edu whitsebd nextwork rose hulman edu writes any one who thinks that homosexuality and christianity are compatible should check out romans i corinthians i timothy jude ii peter gen lev to name a few of the verses that pertain to homosexuality but wouldn t that go for any sin my father told me when he was growing up catholics were not allowed to associate with anyone who was divorced there are a few verses prohibitting divorce somehow divorce became acceptable even in catholicism anullments certainly it is no longer a sin to associate with a divorced person the point is that each person has their own temptations to deal with paul repeatedly talks about the thorn in his side some think it refers to lust others pride but who knows whatever the thorn was apparently it was not compatible with christianity yet does that make his epistles any less the bible warns us against judging greed anxiety impure thoughts bearing grudges etc etc i suppose we should seek out all the so called christians who have entertained impure thoughts and oust them all those who have given in to greed get em outta here jesus pointed out that he was the physician for the sinners any attempts to make homosexuals feel unwelcome because of our discomfort with homosexuality is incompatible with christianity is our hatred so deep that rather than see someone try to become closer to jesus we need to keep them away does jesus need us to screen out those guilty of a particular sin do we really mistrust jesus when he says he can forgive any sin think about it among the people jesus encountered were sinners and the pharisees the sinners he embraced and forgave the pharisees hypocritcal unmerciful self righteous pointed out others sins and did not seek and thus did not gain forgiveness of their own sins what i take from this and other verses is that if we do not admit our sins those sins will not be forgiven and since those guilty of even one sin are guilty of the whole law those not repenting the judging of others are guilty as guilty as if they committed the same sin they judged others of the poor in spirit meek humble merciful pure of heart peacemakers those who thirst for justice those who suffer for his sake are blessed joe moore
re mormon temples in article may athos rutgers edu jwindley cheap cs utah edu jay windley writes there are other interpretations to christian history in this matter one must recall that most of what we know about the gnostics was written by their enemies eusebius claims that jesus imparted secret information to peter james and john after his resurrection and that those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the twelve eusebius historia ecclesiastica ii this is curious i read in eh the lord imparted the gift of knowledge to james the just to john and peter after his resurrection these delivered it to the rest of the apostles and they to the seventy of whom barnabas was one eusebius ecclesiastical history it seems that the lord imparted the gift of knowledge not that the lord imparted secret information apostles interestingly enough eusebius refers to the groups which we today call gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis eusebius op cit iii his gripe was not that thay professed a gnosis but that they had the wrong one i m afraid that i cannot find this portrayal in eh i don t see anywhere in where eusebius mentions that certain gnostics had the wrong gnosis the closest is when eusebius summarizes hegesippus statements whilst if there were any at all that attempted to pervert the sound doctrine of the saving gospel they were yet skulking in dark retreats now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways i don t intend that everyone interpret christian history as i do but i believe that evidence exists favorably interpreted of course of early christian rites analogous to those practiced by mormons today favorably interpreted just in looking at two of the four references that you gave i have the eh handy irenaeus and the clemetine recognitions i will have to look for i see no room for such interpretations and any such interpretation still falls short of an equivalence to the temple ceremonies the links for jay s using eh for support are imparting the gift of knowledge imparted secret information being given secret signs and tokens to gain entrance to heaven but there is not enough equivalence between the the ideas for us to be able to call this favorable interpretation it appears to be closer to fabrication robert weiss psyrobtw ubvms cc buffalo edu

re why do people become atheists in article may athos rutgers edu noye midway uchicago edu writes christians can also feel that sense of difference however when they are associated with those weird televangelists who always talk about satan if you ll excuse the cliched sound of this everyone has to deal with his her differences from other people i can understand how being an atheist could be hard for you being a christian is sometimes hard for me this is not at all comparable christianity is the main stream in western culture you are trivializing the experiences of others i remember what it was like being different as a christian we were told all the time that we were different and in fact that only members of the our church were really christians though others who believed in god weren t as bad as atheists so we were a small minority that was nothing compared to being an atheist the only thing comparable would be a young child being christian being surrounded by staunch atheists including parents who actively persecute any religious tendancies both actual punishments and even worse emotional blackmail they would also have to have the whole mainstream society on their side maybe these conditions could have occured in the old soviet union not in a country with under god in its pledge of allegiance i doubt it even then because children have to be taught to be christians and hence must have support somewhere i have sympathy for gays growing up in repressive environments and having to hide and sometimes at first try to deny a part of themselves because i ve been there only in my case it was my rationality instead of sexuality which i was forced to try to repress in some way the pressures were different of course because you chose your beliefs or are you saying that they were not your choice but born of necessity please no flames about whether or not gay people choose their lifestyle that s elsewhere in this newsgroup yes my atheism was born of necessity for an intellectually honest person belief is mostly a response to evidence will or wishes have nothing to do with it i could choose to lie or to be silent about my true beliefs i could no more choose to believe in the god of christianity than i could decide that the ordinary sky looks red to me still i should be clear that i m not equating what i went through with what gays go through however it is a mistake to assume that everyone who goes through painful experiences are broken by them happily some are made stronger once we get past it i must say that i wasn t hurt by my experiences in church any more than some of my friends who didn t become atheists i was just hurt differently i m not sure i understand this sentence could you explain not without going to details and violating the confidences of some of my childhood friends suffice it say to that religion does not guarantee that a person will be happy and strong emotionally and a repressive upbringing can leave its scars even or especially on those who don t get free of it i doubt that any sane and sincere person doubts that and i feel no need to defend it by the way i am much happier and stronger being out of the closet in the end it has been as someone eloquently put it in private email an experience of liberation rather than disillusion bill mayne
re homosexual issues in christianity mls panix com michael siemon writes in may athos rutgers edu whitsebd nextwork rose hulman edu bryan whitsell writes any one who thinks that homosexuality and christianity are compatible should check out romans i corinthians i timothy jude ii peter gen lev to name a few of the verses that pertain to homosexuality homosexual christians have indeed checked out these verses some of them are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations others simply do not address the issues i can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues however a couple of them seem as though they do not require incredibly perverse interpretations in order to be seen as condemning homosexuality do not be deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate nor homosexuals nor thieves nor the covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor swindlers shall inherit the kingdom of god and such were some of you i cor would someone care to comment on the fact that the above seems to say fornicators will not inherit the kingdom of god how does this apply to homosexuals i understand fornication to be sex outside of marriage is this an accurate definition is there any such thing as same sex marriage in the bible my understanding has always been that the new testament blesses sexual intercourse only between a husband and his wife i am however willing to listen to scriptural evidence to the contrary you shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female it is an abomination also you shall not have intercourse with any animal to be defiled with it nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate with it it is a perversion lev i notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse i know of no new testament passages that clearly condemn or even mention intercourse with animals do those who argue for the legitimacy of homosexual intercourse believe that the bible condemns bestiality as a perversion and if so why that is what verses would you cite to prove that bestiality was perverted and sinful could the verses you cite be refuted by interpreting them differently can one be a christian zoophile by the way i myself am subject to sexual desires that i did not choose to have and that many people would regard as perverted and sinful so please understand that i am not asking these questions out of an antipathy towards my fellow people of alternative orientations i do believe however that one should read the bible with an attitude of what is the bible trying to say and not what do i want the bible to say i choose not to give in to my perverted sexual desires because i believe the bible tries to tell me whether i like it or not that such things are sin it is frustrating at times and i have had days where it really got me down but i don t blame god for this i blame the sin itself mark there s some ambiguity about the meaning of the words in the passage you quote both liberal and conservative sources seem to agree that homosexual is not the general term for homosexuals but is likely to have a meaning like homosexual prostitute that doesn t meant that i think all the biblical evidence vanishes but the nature of the evidence is such that you can t just quote one verse and solve things i think your argument from fornication is circular why is homosexuality wrong because it s fornication why is it fornication because they re not married why aren t they married because the church refuses to do a marriage ceremony why does the church refuse to do a marriage ceremony because homosexuality is wrong in order to break the circle there s got to be some other reason to think homosexuality is wrong clh

re mary s assumption i hate to sound flippant having shot off my mouth badly on the net before but i m afraid that much of this material only adds to my feeling that the assumption of mary would be better phrased our assumptions about mary in all the time i ve been reading about mary on this group i can not recall reading much about mary that did not sound like wishful veneration with scant if any scriptural foundation i find in the new testament a very real portrait of christ s parents as compellingly human persons to be honored and admired for their humility and submission to god s working beyond doubt but the almalga mation of theories and dogma that has accreted around them gives me an image of alien and inhuman creatures untouched by sin or human desire only christ himself was so truly sanctified and even he knew temptation albeit without submitting to it i also don t see the necessity of saying the holy parents were some how sanctified beyond normal humanity it sounds like our own inability to grasp the immensity of god s grace in being incarnated through an or dinary human being i won t start yelling about how people are worshipping mary etc since folks have told me otherwise about that but i do think we lose part of the wonder of god s incarnation in christ when we make his parents out to be sinless sexless deathless otherworldly beings paul marxhausen university of nebraska lincoln grace happens
re serbian genocide work of god in article may athos rutgers edu db n andrew cmu edu d andrew byler writes does he believe in predestination of course i believe in predestination it s a very biblical doctrine as romans shows among other passages furthermore the church has always taught predestination from the very beginning really you may be right but i d like proof as far as i know and i am not a div school student the catholic church does not seem to accept predestination my chaplain told me beware of greeks bearing gifts with reference to this doctrine it seems to have the curious result that human beings are not held responsible for their own actions i ll answer how you deal with this in a minute but to say that i believe in predestination does not mean i do not believe in free will men freely choose the course of their life which is also affected by the grace of god however unlike the calvinists and jansenists i hold that grace is resistable otherwise you end up with the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of god timothy right that doesn t really seem like predestination to me but i ll continue with what you re saying for god must give enough grace to all to be saved but only the elect who he foreknew are predestined and receive the grace of final perserverance which guarantees heaven this does not mean that those without that grace can t be saved it just means that god foreknew their obstinacy and chose not to give it to them knowing they would not need it as they had freely chosen hell this is really confusing to me especially since i still believe that christ jesus died for all of us preknowledge of obstinacy seems like an awfully convoluted way to account for a couple of verses but then i am not really biblically supported in this opinion or am i others people who are saved are saved by the grace of god and not by their own effort for it was god who disposed them to himself and predestined them to become saints but those who perish in everlasting fire perish because they hardened their heart and chose to perish thus they were deserving of god s punishment as they had rejected their creator and sinned against the working of the holy spirit so god uses grace like margarine he only spreads it where it s needed and not where it isn t and so there are the saved and the not saved and nothing in between hmmmm yes it is up to god to judge but he will only mete out that punishment at the last judgement well i would hold that as god most certainly gives everybody some blessing for what good they have done even if it was only a little for those he can t bless in the next life he blesses in this one although i realize this doctrine was not originally intended to cause social problems it ends up doing just that if there is supposed to be some sort of sign that someone is elect like lots of children or success at work then those who have a good life on earth will go around thinking that those who don t are doomed to hell in a way though this sounds like the opposite idea those doomed to hell will have a great life on earth that s almost like the converse of what i believe responsibility for what we do now will be punished after we die you re saying what we get after we die has a direct bearing on how we live now strange and those he will not punish in the next life will be chastised in this one or in purgatory for their sins every sin incurs some temporal punishment thus god will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it cf samuel david s sin of adultery and murder were forgiven but he was still punished with the death of his child and i need not point out the idea of punishment because of god s judgement is quite prevelant in the bible sodom and gommorrah moses barred from the holy land the slaughter of the cannanites annias and saphira jerusalem in ad etc so sin is either punished now or later and not both what if it s sort of half punished are there any grey areas in this doctrine my stuff deleted we should stop the slaughter of the innocent cf proverbs but does that mean that christians should support a war in bosnia with the u s or even the u n involved i do not think so but i am an isolationist and disagree with foreign adventures in general but in the case of bosnia i frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily involved it would not be a just war blessed after all are the peacemakers was what our lord said not the interventionists our actions in bosnia must be for peace and not for a war which is unrelated to anything to justify it for us the idea well my idea would be that you would intervene to establish peace and stop the atrocities i m not suggesting wwiii i don t really understand what you mean by a just war of course i am not an isolationist although i see some merit in not jumping in at the first opportunity can you say kuwait we happen to be a big country with a lot of resources as well as a lot of debt and this gives us some responsibility in the world whether we like it or not flashbacks of wwii as well as vietnam should be haunting us yet another difference of opinion so be it andy byler thank you for answering i hope you don t take any of

re question about virgin mary d andrew byler db n andrew cmu edu wrote however greatly we extoll mary it is quite obvious that she is in no way god or even part of god or equal to god the assumption of our blessed mother meant that because of her close identification with the redemptive work of christ she was assumed note that she did not ascend body and soul into heaven and is thus one of the few along with elijah enoch moses maybe who are already perfected in heaven obviously the virgin mary is far superior in glorification to any of the previously mentioned personages as i said it is a provocative thought from answer to job the logical consistency of the papal declaration cannot be surpassed and it leaves protestantism with the odium of being nothing but a man s religion which allows no metaphysical representation of woman protestantism has obviously not given sufficient attention to the signs of the times which point to the equality of women but this equality requires to be metaphysically anchored in the figure of a divine woman the bride of christ just as the person of christ cannot be replaced by an organization so the bride cannot be re placed by the church the feminine like the masculine demands an equally personal representation the dogmatizing of the assumption does not however according to the dogmatic view mean that mary has attained the status of a goddess although as mistress of heaven and mediatrix she is functionally on a par with christ the king and mediator at any rate her position satisfies the need of the archetype par jung should stick to psychology rather than getting into theology jung made it clear that he was talking about psychology not theology his comments had to do with the psychological image of god and its function in the human psyche not about the actual existence or nature of god revdak netcom com

re monophysites and mike walker in article may athos rutgers edu our moderator comments chalcedon was a compromise between two groups the alexandrians and antiochenes it adopted language that was intended to be acceptable to moderates in both camps while ruling out the extremes i agree that there were extremes that were heretical however in the course of the complex politics of the time it appears that some people got rejected who didn t intend heresy but simply used language that was not understood or even was mispresented and some seem not to have jointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine there are groups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps this posting discussed the descendants of the alexandrians there are also a remaining nestorians like some of the current so called monophysites there is reason to believe that the current so called nestorians are not heretical either they sheltered nestorius from what they saw as unfair treatment but claim they did not adopt his heresies and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of the antiochene tradition clh there is a big difference between the status of what you refer to as alexandrians actually this includes all oriental orthodox churches and not only copts and that of nestorians the oriental orthodox churches never even shelter eutyches the advocator of monophysitism but on the contrary it condemned and still does condemn him and his heresy that is why the eastren chalcedonian orthodox church held talks with the oriental non chalcedonian that started years ago and still continueing till today but they have converged on many issues the most imporatant of which is christology i have more details of the inter orthodox dialogue in case anyone is interested so i do not see how the alexandrians and the nestorians are in a similar position peace nabil nabil ayoub engine research center dept of mechanical engineering university of wisconsin madison email ayoub erctitan me wisc edu

re earthquake prediction mserv mozart cc iup edu mail server writes ok a few days back the below included message was posted stating i believe with everything in my heart that on may the city of portland oregon in the country of the united states of america will be hit with a catastrophic and disastrous earthquake by now we know that this did not come to pass i don t think it s particularly glorifying to god to say things like well i think the lord is telling me such statements seem to me to be an attempt to get a spiritual thrill should the guess happen to come true without risking the guilt of false prophecy should it fail to come to pass i do not believe genuine prophecy was ever like this comments i agree people should not be misled to believe thus sayeth the lord by innuendo or opinion or speculation speak directly if the lord has given you something to say say it but before i declare thus sayeth the lord i d better know for certain without a shadow of a doubt that i am in the correct spiritual condition and relationship with the lord to receive such a prophecy and be absolutely certain again without the tiniest shadow of a doubt that there is no possibility of my being misled by my own imaginations or by my hope of gaining recognition or of being misled by the wiles of the devil and his followers mistakes in this area are costly and dangerous for me my greatest fears in this area would be the following that the people would be misled that people would lose respect for christianity that true prophecy would be clouded by all the false prophecies were god to call me to be a prophet and i were to misrepresent god s word my calling would be lost forever god s word would command the people never to listen to or fear my words as i would be a false prophet my bridges would be burnt forever perhaps i could repent and be saved but i could never again be a prophet of god in the light of this it is critical that we speak when the lord says speak and that we be silent when the lord says to be silent lest we deprive the world of god s word and hide it under a bushel either by our inappropriate cowardly silence or by our false statements and because of this it is critically important that we remain close to the lord in his word and in prayer and filled with the spirit of god so that we know the difference in this day and age sinners spout off their mouths left and right judging one another claiming rights that are not theirs denying rights that do indeed belong to others demanding equal respect for all the gods of this world and uttering every form of falseness that promises to make one feel good it s time that we christians give an example of honesty that stands out in contrast against this backdrop of falsehood when we say thus sayeth the lord it happens when we pray prayer is answered because we prayed right when we say we re christians we really mean it dan i deplore the horrible crime of child murder we want prevention not merely punishment we must reach the root of the evil it is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt from the dreadful deed no mater what the motive love of ease or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed but oh thrice guilty is he who drove her to the desperation which impelled her to the crime susan b anthony the revolution july

re if there were no hell ofm comments the only problem with this is that jesus does use hell as a threat he doesn t sound like some of the more extreme fire and brimstone preachers and i don t think he wants people to live in abject fear but he talks a lot about people being found unworthy and mentions hell a number of times i agree that it might be more pleasant to think that it doesn t exist i certainly don t agree that god is some sort of sadist who tortures people forever but i am very much afraid that there really is a life and death spiritual struggle going on and that it is possible for people to lose in a serious way clh no disagreement at all that there is a very serious struggle going on but jesus more typically uses consequences as a threat that s quite different from hell classic tm jesus doesn t sound like the usual hell fire type of preacher he attracts people through what he does and the stongest example in jesus preaching is in the parable of lazarus and dives which is a parable in any case my point is that a fear based response to christ is not a freeing life affirming choice and isn t good news in a meaningful sense there are plenty of good reasons to follow jesus that have nothing to do with fear or a literal hell that still pertain to overcoming in the present struggle between god and the disloyal opposition a faith based in fear is not built on rock as we should found our faith but on ice if the fear were removed there would be no foundation that s basically why it matters to me i think we have many christians that don t have a solid basis for relating to the living incarnate god i cannot be fully open to the working of god in and through my life if my response to god is motivated on fear larry overacker llo shell com lawrence overacker shell oil company information center houston tx llo shell com

dreams and out of body incidents hey folks i m fairly new to these groups tho some have heard from me before i d like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a lot what morals ethics apply to dreams and out of body incidents in normal dreams you can t control anything so obviously you aren t morally responsible for your actions but if you can contrive to control the action in dreams or do an oobe it seems like a morality applies now there seem to be alternatives dreams and oobes are totally mental phenomena in this case no morality applies beyond what might be called mental hygiene that is not trying to think about anything evil or indulgining in overly sexy or violent thoughts dreams and oobes have a reality of their own i e are another plane evidence for this is that often dreams and oobes are sometimes done in common by more than one person a mark of objective fact is that people report the same objective experience in this case the same interpersonal morality ethics applies in dreams and oobes as does in waking life like but here we assume that though the dreeam and oobe environs have a real existence a different moral ethics apply there and no or maybe different moral laws apply there so there it is is one of these cases the truth or does anyone know of another alternative respond by post or email thanks very much dt
re why do people become atheists in article may athos rutgers edu gt b prism gatech edu randal lee nicholas mandock writes in article may athos rutgers edu muirm argon gas organpipe uug arizona edu maxwell c muir writes in all candor i would be happy to be proven wrong about believing in atheism problem is i will have to be proven wrong in mentioning some nonsense about psychology and atheism bob muir asks the following question no smiley on the part about atheism i see do you realize that your statement says that i was mentioning nonsense about atheism this is hard for me to defend against if this is the claim you are making as you have only included the last two sentences of my post and mentioned the first please address the substance of my post rather than rejecting it out of hand but because of the sometimes ambiguous nature of english i may be misinterpreting your wording here please clarify did you or did you not mean to call my statements about atheism nonsense if so care to back up that claim do i sound broken to you i answer in the affirmative ok then start up the amatuer psycology again how am i broken is it politically correct for christians to be the only besieged group permitted the luxury of arrogance yawn excuse me i don t recall any portion of my post in which i called christians arrogant quote me if i did i do remember calling christianity silly and then following that up with information that i was nine years old when i thought that i also said that i find faith to be intellectually dishonest and i would like to see some sort of proof of your god s existence i define faith as belief in the absense of any proof btw also i subscribe to a a as i mentioned and we see fundies of all types there so in answer to your question no finally i d hardly call christianity beseiged in this country i seldom see christians ridiculed for merely practising their religion or wearing crosses or having christian bumper stickers i don t know for sure of course i only say i haven t seen it happening what i have seen happening is my homosexual and or friends being beat up or preached at by people who claim to be christ s followers i know that this sort of thing isn t practiced by the majority of christians but it is a very vocal minority who are doing it and i don t see comperable victimization of christians now i have a question for bob why in the world would any self respecting atheist want to subscribe to a christian news group the implication being that i am not self respecting of course i m not a student of psychology btw but i am a student of creative writing and linguistics so literary analysis is my forte also if the implications i see are improper please let me know i m here because i m not sequestered in my own little atheist cubbyhole as you seem to think atheists should be did it occur to you that i don t think i know everything and that maybe someone will say something that will change my life have you read my other posts here or did you see atheist and decide it was time to poke at someone who doesn t deserve your respect aw geez i m sorry i probably am getting my back up a little too high here it s just that the nonsense thing really annoys me i figure you should see my first reactions though since they are my true reactions to your question now the smoothed feather version i seek all sorts of knowledge that s why i came to my university yes i am looking at your religion well sorta i have no idea what kind of christian you are from the outside and hopefully with an objective view i ve been trying to ask reasoned questions here because i genuinely don t know the answers to them but when i saw the question directed at atheists i figured i would answer after all you can speculate about atheist motives here all you want hence the amatuer psychology crack but without an atheist you can t be sure of even one atheist s motive i m hoping people really want to know and i was trying to show that i actually checked out several religions and i actually read all the pamphlets people have to offer and i actually think about these things instead i m still faced with the implication that atheism is some kind of aberration and that only broken people are atheist try it from the flip side i posit that atheism is the natural state and only broken people are theists i offer as proof that so many people witness from horrible lives which picked up as soon as they discovered their religion that religion is regional if people didn t follow the religion of their areas there would be a more homogenous mix so many terrorists claim theistic motives and that theists tend to be so pushy and angry when challenged on alt atheism why are religions so successful because there is so much suffering in the world which breaks people it s an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it which is another reason i m here to try to see the flip side of my thinking and also as a watchdog for logical fallacies i have a difficult enough time keeping up with it and i think i know something about the subject the implication here being that atheists can t possibly know anything about christianity probably jumping at shadows again but i think my reaction is somewhat justified after all the first post suggested that atheists are broken hostile people this post confirms that someone else believes it bob reminds me of my roommate in order to disbelieve atheism he says he will need to be proven wrong about it well he got me there i am a strong atheist because i feel that lack of evidence especially about something like an omnipotent being implies lack of existence however i haven t met the strong atheist yet who said that nothing could ever persuade him call me a seeker if you like i don t weak atheism is being ignore here though some atheists simply say i don t believe in any god rather than my position i believe that no god s exist for the weak atheist the is no atheism to disbelieve because they don t actively believe in atheism if you think this is confusing try figuring out the difference between protestants and methodists from an atheist point of view this is another fallacy many theists seem to have that everyone believes in something followed up by everyone has faith in something guess what my atheism ends the moment i m shown a proof of some god s existence is that really too much to ask well i don t even waste my time trying well i guess you won t succeed in converting him or me why the supposition that you will fail to convince him amatuer psycology on is it because you yourself are unconvinced i tell him that he ll just have to take my word for it and i told you that i find faith to be intellectually dishonest note that i can only speak for myself if you find faith to be honest show me how i have been unable to reconcile it so far maybe that s how i m broken i tell you that i have invisible fairies living in my garden and that you should just take my word for it if you accept that you are of a fundamentally different mind than i and i really would like to know how you think all i ask for is proof of the assertion god exists logical or physical proofs only please then we ll discuss the nature of god in response he tells me he will say an atheist s prayer for me prayer uh oh we ll have to revoke his atheist club

re when are two people married in god s e in article may athos rutgers edu gt b prism gatech edu randal lee nicholas mandock writes i am not against capital punishment i feel this way because god is not only a god of love but a god of justice as we christians are the instruments of his will here on earth we are expected to be true to the mandate given us by the lord to judge the actions of our fellow man my favorite scriptural reference in this regard is romans let every person be subordinate to the higher authorities for there is no authority except from god and those that exist have been established by god therefore whoever resists authority opposes what god has appointed and those who oppose it will bring judgment upon themselves my views reflect the teaching of the roman catholic church i would say only to the extent that the roman catholic church neither approves nor disapproves of capital punishment as confirmed in the recent catechism though there are many rcs who were rather surprised and upset that capital punishment was not explicitly condemned for myself as a catholic i see my own opposition to capital punishment as much the same as my opposition to abortion a reverence for life here in the uk the anti abortion case is often let down by the explicit link which those on the political left make with anti abortionists and pro executionists there is a tendency to condemn people who hold both views as hypocrites i feel that if there were many more anti abortionists who were also vocal in their opposition to capital punishment on a pro life line it would end this kneejerk association of anti abortion as a right wing thing and get many to think seriously about the issue there are plenty who are pro abortion equally for a kneejerk left wing reason i do not think your biblical quote can automatically be taken as support for capital punishment i take it that as a roman catholic you are opposed to abortion and would still onsider it wrong and something to be objected to even if legalised by authority matthew huntbach

re atheists and hell to summarize while questioning the sagacity of someone who said they would rather spend an eternity in hell than be beside god in heaven knowing even one man would spend his eternal life being scorched for his wrongdoings i described how horrible hell is and compared the above statement with jesus suffering on the cross in order to prevent people going to hell which kenneth engel challenges did this happen to jesus i don t think so not from what i heard he lived one day of suffering and died if the wages of sin is the above paragraph then jesus didn t pay for our sins did he i will wimp out and admit that i never liked the metaphor of jesus paying for our sins in the sense that many christians accept as literal the point is that god understands the suffering we go through not just intellectually like when we watch the somalians on tv but really understands he can feel our pain this fact is manifested by jesus life we can argue that someone in history might have suffered more than jesus we can think of more horrible torture than crucifixion we can think of cases of betrayal and fruitless effort leading to worse despair but the main point is that jesus is in the trenches with us he is in everyone whatever i do to the least of humanity i do to him and whatever i do for the least of humanity i do for him now to reconcile this with the existence of hell is beyond my capabilities but that wasn t my goal i d be surprised to see the moderator let this one through thankfully our moderator is surprising but i seriously want a reasonable explanation for this as i re read this i must admit that this is more of a description of my faith than an explanation but perhaps that s all i can do hopefully that s all i have to do chris mussack

re deuterocanonicals esp sirach in article may athos rutgers edu revdak netcom com d andrew kille writes dave davis ddavis cass ma bull com wrote lots deleted with which i generally agree there is no inherently defensible argument for the inclusion or exclusion of the deuterocanonical books i think everyone would agree that principles that cannot be consistently applied are not very useful as principles so if we are to exclude them not accord them the authority of scripture we would appear to require other reasons what might these reasons be lets talk about principles if we accept that god sets the standards for what ought to be included in scripture then we can ask is it authoritative is it prophetic is it authentic is it dynamic is it received collected read and used on these counts the apocrapha falls short of the glory of god to quote unger s bible dictionary on the apocrapha they abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and anachronisms they teach doctrines which are false and foster practices which are at variance with sacred scripture they resort to literary types and display an artificiality of subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred scripture they lack the distinctive elements which give genuine scripture their divine character such as prophetic power and poetic and religious feeling my interim conclusion is that protestant exclusion of at least one of these writings is one of those traditions of men one hears of so often they were excluded during the reformation and that appears to be the reason many people continue to exclude them but the problem with this argument lies in the assumption that the hebrew canon included the apocrapha in the first place and it wasn t until the sixteenth century that luther and co threw them out the jewish council you mentioned previously didn t accept them so the reformation protestants had good historical precedence for their actions jerome only translated the apocrapha under protest and it was literally over his dead body that it was included in the catholic canon the simple fact is that protestant exclusion roman inclusion orthodox inclusion of still other books or any other definition of a closed canon is the decision of a community of faith about what the standard collection of scripture shall be for that community they all are traditions of men whether one considers that to be a problem or not depends on which community happens to be yours and how you accept define authority within it i personally believe that the concept of a closed canon whether catholic protestant or orthodox is one that developed rather late in the history of the church and which has not served the church well how do you then view the words i warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book if anyone adds anything to them god will add to him the plagues described in this book and if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy god will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the holy city rev surely this sets the standard and not just man made traditions it is also noteworthy to consider jesus attitude he had no argument with the pharisees over any of the ot canon john and explained to his followers on the road to emmaus that in the law prophets and psalms which referred to him the ot division of scripture luke as well as in luke taking genesis to chronicles the jewish order we would say genesis to malachi as scripture see dr lee macdonald s the formation of the christian biblical canon abingdon for a clear and faithful examination of the origins and issues of the canon i am not familiar with the book some other arguments you might like to consider are found in chapter of josh mcdowell s evidence that demands a verdict barney resson many shall run to and fro knowledge shall increase daniel
re christianity and repeated lives in article may athos rutgers edu smayo world std com sc ott a mayo writes gerry palo writes there is nothing in christianity that precludes the idea of repeated lives on earth doesn t it say somewhere it is appointed to man once to die and then judgement i don t have a concordance here but i have some dim memory that this appears somewhere in the bible given a fairly specific context for what judgement is i d say that more or less decides the issue heb clh indeed the immediate context nasb is otherwise he would have needed to suffer often since the foundation of the world but now once at the consummation he has been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself and inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgement so christ also having been offered once to bear the sins of many shall appear a second time not to bear sin tro those who eagerly await him the first point is that this verse is part of an even larger context the subject of which is not the destiny of the individual human soul but rather the singular nature of christ s sacrifice once and the fulfillment of the law for all of fallen mankind rudolf frieling elaborates this in detail in his christianity and reincarnation the thrust of the passage in its context is to liken the one time incarnation and sacrifice of christ for all mankind to the individual experience of the human being after death the once is repeated and emphasized and it highlights the singularity of christ s deed one thing for certain it does is to refute the claims of some that christ incarnates more than once but the comparison to the human experience die once then judgement note not the judgement but just judgement the word for judgement is krisis hebrews is the one passage most often quoted in defense of the doctrine that the bible denies reincarnation at this point i would just emphasize again that the passages that arguably speak against it are few and that invariably they are talking about something eles and the apparent denial of reincarnation is either inferred or as in the case of hebrews taken literally and deposited into an implied context namely a doctrine of the destiny of the human being after death what should be considered seriously is that the bible is essentially silent about the fate of the individual human being between death and the last day if you take the few passages that could possibly be interpreted to mean a single earth life they are arguable and there are other passages that point arguably in the other direc tion such as matthew and john we can continue to debate the individual scraps of scripture that might have a bearinig on this and indeed we should discuss them but what i wanted to introduce into the discussion was an approach to the idea of repeated earth lives that unlike hindu buddhist and new age teachings takes full cognizance of the divinity singular incarnation death burial resurrection and second coming of christ as the savior of mankind the accountability of each individual for his deeds and the reality of the fall and of sin and its consequences the redemption of man from sin through christ the resurrection of the body and the last judgement taken in this larger sense many serious questions take on an entirely different perspective e g the destiny of those who died in their sins before christ came the relationship of faith and grace to works the meaning of deathbed conversion the meaning of the sacraments and many other things not that i propose to answer all those questions by a simple doctrine of convenience but only that the discussion takes on a different dimension and in my opinion one that is truly worthy of both man the earth and their creator and redeemer there are many deep questions that continue to be deep such as the meaning of the second death and how the whole of christian doctrine would apply to this larger perspective of human existence there are those who deeply believe that the things of which the bible does not speak are not things we should be concerned with but christ also indicated that there were other things that we would come to know in the future including things that his disciples and therefore others could not bear yet this idea that the human capacity for growth in knowledge not only of the individual in one lifetime but of the whole of humanity also takes on great meaning when we realize that our growth in the spirit is a long term process the bible was not meant to codify all spiritual knowledge in one place forever but to proclaim the gospel of the incarnation and redeeming deed of christ taking the gospel in the greater context from genesis to revelation now salvation healing becomes not the end of man s sojourn but its beginning and the last judgement and the new heaven and earth that follow it become its fulfullment gerry palo compuserve com

re deuterocanonicals esp sirach in may athos rutgers edu mdw uxa cso uiuc edu michael d walker writes that last paragraph just about killed me the deuterocanonicals have always been accepted as inspired scripture by the catholic church which has existed much longer than any protestant church out there it was martin luther who began hacking up the bible and deciding to remove certain books not the fact that the catholic church decided to add some much later that is the reason for the difference between catholic and protestant bibles this is misleading at best the question really has to do with the status of the greek septuagint versus hebrew scripture and the issue predates the reformation by quite a bit jerome was negative about the deuteroncanonicals and in fact even though he transalted them he put them after the hebrew canon reordered from the greek ordering to the hebrew one his translations of them were quick and dirty also he reports having done one of them in one day and another overnight just dictating his translation to an amanuensis that is to say it is the vulgate and all of its massive importance in western christianity along with the veneration of jerome which took the first steps in reducing these books from the status they had and have among the greeks furthermore it is inaccurate to say that the reformers threw out these books basically they just placed them in a secondary status as jerome had already done but with the additional warning that doctrine should not be based on citations from these alone i think that the emphasis on the hebrew originals is sound though it seems somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation as part of a collection whose principles of selection in hebrew or greek are confused or unknown and likely fraught with accident it also seems to play into a tendentious notion of the original languages being somehow more inspired as if magical and conveying a message untranslatable than a translation as if we could not hear god s word to the jews in greek or german or english this tendency seems to have got a big boost in sola scriptura protestantism even to the point of current inerrancy bizarreness despite the more basic underlying tendency of the reformers to see that the texts should and could be translated if we can profit from an english rendering of hebrew and greek there is surely little reason to keep sirach at least out of our bibles and of course anglicans don t do so for texts originally in greek it would seem more to be anti greek prejudice notably by the time the hebrew canon is fully attested including anti christian prejudice which led to the jewish abandonment of the septuagint which is operative btw readers may enjoy some lectures of bruce metzger on the issues of translation of the bible including some of what i said about jerome above in the current numbers of the journal bibliotheca sacra two of four have been published so far michael l siemon i say you are gods sons of the mls panix com most high all of you nevertheless or you shall die like men and fall mls ulysses att com like any prince psalm

faq essay on homosexuality someone referred to my faq essay on homosexuality since it hasn t been posted for some time and i ve modified it somewhat since the last time i m taking this opportunity to post it there is another entry in the faq containing comments by some other contributors they can be retrieved from ftp rutgers edu as pub soc religion christian others homosexuality it contains far more detail on the exegetical issues than i give here though primarily from a conservative point of view this posting summarizes several issues involving homosexuality and christians this is a frequently asked question so i do not post the question each time it occurs rather this is an attempt to summarize the postings we get when we have a discussion it summarizes arguments for allowing christian homosexuality since most people asking the question already know the arguments against it the most common but not the only question dealt with herein is how can a christian justify being a homosexual given what the bible says about it first on the definition of homosexual many groups believe that there is a homosexual orientation i e a sexual attraction to members of the same sex this is distinguished from actual homosexual sexual activity homosexuals who abstain from sex are considered by most groups to be acceptable however in a lot of discussion the term homosexual means someone actually engaging in homosexual sex this is generally not accepted outside the most liberal groups in this paper i m going to use homosexual as meaning a person engaging in sexual acts with another of the same sex i haven t heard of any biblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation who remains celebate i think most people now admit that there is a predisposition to be homosexual this is often called a homosexual orientation it is not known whether it is genetic or environmental there is evidence suggesting each the best evidence i ve seen is that homosexuality is not a single phenomenon but has a number of different causes one of them is probably genetic there are several groups that try to help people move from being homosexual to heterosexual the best known is exodus international the reports i ve seen and i haven t read the detailed literature just the summary in the minority opinion to the presbyterian church s infamous report on human sexuality suggest that these programs have very low success rates and that there are questions about how real even the successes are but there certainly are people who say they have converted however this issue is not as important as it sounds those who believe homosexuality is wrong believe it is intrinsically wrong defined as such by god the fact that it s hard to get out of being a homosexual is no more relevant than the fact that it s hard to escape from being a drug addict if it s wrong it s wrong it may affect how we deal with people though if it s very difficult to change this may tend to make us more willing to forgive it one more general background issue it s common to quote a figure that of the population is homosexual i asked one of our experts where this came from here s his response kinsey see below is the source of the figure percent he defines sexuality by behavior not by orientation and ranked all persons on a scale from zero completely heterosexual to completely heterosexual according to kinsey one third of all male adults have had at least one experience of orgasm homosexually post puberty ten percent of all adult males have most of their experiences of homosexually that was in the percentages held true in a followup study done by the kinsey institute based on data in the early seventies but not published until the early s or so by bell and weinberg i believe i can t

to hold true in several other cultures as noted in the recent newsweek coverstory is this child gay feb a journalist is running the rounds of talk shows this season promoting her book that allegedly refutes kinsey s study but the scholarly world seems to take her for a kook i ve seen some objections to the kinsey s study but not in enough detail to include here if someone would like to contribute another view i d be willing to include it most christians believe homosexuality at least genital sex is wrong not all however a few denominations accept it the metropolitan community churches is the best known it was formed specifically to accept homosexuals however the united church of christ also allows it and i think a couple of other groups may as well the episcopal church seems to accept it some areas but not others in churches that have congregational government you ll find a few congregations that accept it even among southern baptists though the number is probably only one or two congregations but these are unusual few churches permit homosexual church leaders how carefully they enforce this is another issue i don t have any doubt that there are homosexual pastors of just about every denomination some more open than others as to the arguments over the biblical and other issues here s an attempt to summarize the issues the most commonly cited reference by those favoring acceptance of homosexuality in previous discussions has been john boswell christianity social tolerance and homosexuality u chicago press the argument against is pretty clear there are several explicit laws in the ot e g leviticus and in rom paul seems pretty negative on homosexuality beyond these references there are some debates some passages often cited on the subject probably are not relevant e g the sin which the inhabitants of sodom proposed to carry out was homosexual rape not homosexual activity between consenting adults there s even some question whether it was homosexual since the entities involved were angels it was particularly horrifying because it involved guests and the responsibility towards guests in that culture was very strong this is probably the reason lot offered his daughter it was better to give up his daughter than to allow his guests to be attacked if you look through a concordance for references to sodom elsewhere in the bible you ll see that few seem to imply that homosexuality was their sin there s a jewish interpretive tradition that the major sin was abuse of guests at any rate there s no debate that homosexual rape is wrong i do not discuss leviticus because the law there is part of a set of laws that most christians do not consider binding so unless nt justification can be found lev alone would not settle the issue the nt references are all in paul s letters a number of the references from paul are lists of sins in which the words are fairly vague boswell argues that the words occuring in these lists do not mean homosexual here s what he says the two greek words that appear in the lists i e i cor and i tim are malakos and arsenokoitai unfortunately it is not entirely clear what the words actually mean malakos with a basic meaning of soft has a variety of metaphorical meanings in ethical writing boswell suggests wanton as a likely equivalent he also reports that the unanimous interpretation of the church including greek speaking christians was that in this passage it referred to masturbation a meaning that has vanished only in the th cent as that practice has come to be less frowned upon he cites references as late as the edition of the catholic encyclopedia that identify it as masturbation he translates arsenokotai as male prostitute giving evidence that none of the church fathers understood the term as referring to homosexuality in general a more technical meaning suggested by the early latin translations would be active mode homosexual male prostitute but in his view paul did not intend it so technically for a more conservative view i consulted gordon fee s commentary on i cor he cites evidence that malakos often meant effeminate however boswell warns us that in greek culture effeminate is not necessarily synonymous with homosexual though it may be associated with some kinds of homosexual behavior given what boswell and fee say taken together i suspect that the term is simply not very definite and that while it applies to homosexuals in some cases it isn t a general term for homosexuality while fee argues against boswell with arsenokotai as well he ends up suggesting a translation that seems essentially the same the big problem with it is that the word is almost never used paul s writing is the first occurence the fact that the word is clearly composed of male and f k unfortunately doesn t quite tell us the meaning since it doesn t tell us whether the male is the subject or object of the action examples of compound words formed either way can be given in theory it could refer to rapists etc it s dangerous to base meaning purely on etymology or you ll conclude that goodbye is a religious expression because it s based on god by with ye however since boswell fee and niv seem to agree on homosexual male prostitute that seems as good a guess as any note that this translation misses the strong vulgarity of the term however something which fee and boswell agree on but do not attempt to reproduce in their translation in my opinion the strongest nt reference to homosexuality is romans boswell points out that rom speaks of homosexuality as something that happened to people who were naturally heterosexual as a result of their corruption due to worshipping false gods one could argue that this is simply an example that if a homosexual worshipped false gods he would also fall into degradation and perhaps become heterosexual however i find this argument somewhat forced and in fact our homosexual readers have not seriously proposed that this is what paul meant however i am not convinced that rom is sufficient to create a law against homosexuality for christians what paul is describing in rom is not homosexuality among christians it s homosexuality that appeared among idolaters as one part of a whole package of wickedness despite the impression left by his impassioned rhetoric i m sure paul does not believe that pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex given his description of their situation i rather assume that their heterosexual sex would also be debased and shameless so yes i do believe that this passage indicates a negative view of homosexuality but in all fairness the shameless nature of their acts is a reflection of the general spiritual state of the people and not a specific feature of homosexuality my overall view of the situation is the following i think we have enough evidence to be confident that paul disapproved of homosexuality rom seems clear while i cor and i tim are not unambiguous and general condemnations of homosexuality they do not seem like wording that would come from someone who approved of homosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases on the other hand none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the subject rom is really about idolatry it refers to homosexuality in passing the result of this situation is that people interpret these passages in light of their general approach to scripture for those who look to scripture for laws about issues such as this it not surprising that they would consider these passages to be nt endorsement of the ot prohibition for those whose approach to the bible is more liberal it is not surprising that they regard paul s negative view of homosexuality as something that he took from his jewish upbringing without any serious reexamination in the light of the gospel as readers of this group know by now the assumptions behind these approaches are so radically different that people tend to foam at the mouth when they see the opposing view described there s not a lot i can do as moderator about such a situation a number of discussions in the past centered around the sort of detailed exegesis of texts that is described above however in fact i m not convinced that defenders of homosexuality actually base their own beliefs on such analyses the real issue seems to rest on the question of whether paul s judgement should apply to modern homosexuality one commonly made claim is that paul had simply never faced the kinds of questions we are trying to deal with he encountered homosexuality only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was wrong he had never faced the experience of christians who try to act straight and fail and he had never faced christians who are trying to define a christian homosexuality which fits with general christian ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the relationship between god and man it is unfair to take paul s judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make judgements on these questions another is the following in paul s time homosexuality was associated with a number of things that christians would not find acceptable it was part of temple prostitution among private citizens it often occured between adults and children or free people and slaves i m not in a position to say that it always did but there are some reasons to think so the ancients distinguished between the active and passive partner it was considered disgraceful for a free adult to act as the passive partner this is the reason that an active mode homosexual prostitute would be considered disgraceful his customers would all be people who enjoyed the passive role this supports the idea that it would tend not to be engaged in between two free adult males at least not without some degree of scandal clearly christian homosexuals would not condone sex with children slaves or others who are not in a position to be fully responsible partners however fee s commentary on i cor cites some examples from ancient literature of homosexual relationships that do seem to involve free adults in a reasonably symmetrical way thus the considerations in this paragraph shouldn t be pushed too far homosexuality may have been discredited for jews by some of these associations but there surely must be been cases that were not prostitutes and did not involve slaves or children some people have argued that aids is a judgement against homosexuality i d like to point out that aids is transmitted by promiscuous sex both homosexual and heterosexual someone who has a homosexual relationship that meets christian criteria for marriage is not at risk for aids note that there is good reason from paul s general approach to doubt that he would concede homosexuality as a fully equal alternative apart from any specific statements on homosexuality i believe his use of the genesis story would lead him to regard heterosexual marriage as what god ordained however the way paul deals with pastoral questions provides a warning against being too quick to deal with this issue legally i claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual christians is not entirely a theological issue but also a pastoral one paul s tendency as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating holidays is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues to look very carefully at the good of the people involved and to avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging for example while paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat meat he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about which they had personal qualms for another example paul obviously would have preferred to see people at least in some circumstances remain unmarried yet if they were unable to do so he certainly would rather see them married than in a state where they might be tempted to fornication i believe one could take a view like this even while accepting the views paul expressed in rom one may believe that homosexuality is not what god intended that it occured as a result of sin but still conclude that at times we have to live with it note that in the creation story work enters human life as a result of sin this doesn t mean that christians can stop working when we are saved the question is whether you believe that homosexuality is in itself sinful or whether you believe that it s a misfortune that is in a broad sense due to human sinfulness if you re willing to consider the latter approach then it becomes a pastoral judgement whether there is more damage caused by finding a way to live with it or trying to cure it the dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often fails and when it does you end up with damage ranging from psychological damage to suicide as well as broken marriages when attempts at living as a heterosexual fail this is going to depend upon one s assessment of the inherent nature of homosexuality if you believe it is a very serious wrong then you may be willing to run high risks of serious damage to get rid of it clearly we do not generally suggest that people live with a tendency to steal or with drug addiction even though attempts to cure these conditions are also very difficult however these conditions are intrinsically damaging in a way that is not so obvious for homosexuality many problems associated with homosexuality are actually problems of promiscuity not homosexuality this includes aids i take for granted that the only sort of homosexual relationships a christian would consider allowing would be equivalent to christian heterosexual relationships in the course of discussing this over the last decade or so we ve heard a lot of personal testimony from fellow christians who are in this situation i ve also seen summaries of various research and the results of various efforts for conversion aside from the presbyterian report mentioned above there s an faq that summarizes our readers reports on this question the evidence is that long term success in changing orientation is rare enough to be on a par with healing miracles the danger in advising christians to depend upon such a change is clear when conversion doesn t happen which is almost always the people are often left in despair feeling excluded from a church that has nothing more to say but a requirement of life long celibacy paul recognized though in a different context that such a demand is not practical for most people and i think the history of clerical celibacy has strongly reinforced that judgement the practical result is that homosexuals end up in the gay sex clubs and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality maybe homosexuality isn t god s original ideal but i can well imagine paul preferring to see people in long term committed christian relationships than promiscuity as with work which genesis suggests wasn t part of god s original ideal either i think such relationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing god s love with each other there s an issue of biblical interpretation underlying this discussion the issue is that of cultural relativism that is when paul says that something is wrong should this be taken as an eternal statement or are things wrong because of specific situations in the culture of the time conservative christians generally insist on taking prohibitions as absolute since otherwise the bible becomes subjective what is to stop us from considering everything in it as relative when looking at this issue it s worth noting that no one completely rejects the concept of cultural relativism there are a number of judgements in the new testament that even conservative christians consider to be relative the following judgements are at least as clear in the bible as anything said on homosexuality prohibition against charging interest this occurs times in the ot it s not in the nt but i mention it here because until relatively recently the church did consider it binding on christians prohibition against swearing oaths endorsement of slavery as an institution judgement of tax collectors as sinner we do not regard these items as binding in most cases i believe the argument is essentially one of cultural relativism briefly prohibition of interest is appropriate to a specific agrarian society that the bible was trying to build but not to our market economy few people believe that american judicial oaths have the same characteristics as the kind of oaths jesus was concerned about most people believe that paul was simply telling people how to live within slavery but not endorsing it as an institution for people believe that the irs is morally equivalent to roman tax farming the point i m trying to make is that before applying biblical prohibitions to the th cent we need to look at whether the th cent actions are the same when christian homosexuals say that their relationships are different than the greek homosexuality that paul would have been familiar with this is exactly the same kind of argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors until fairly recently christians prohibited taking of interest and many christians regarded slavery as divinely endorsed indeed slavery is one of the more common metaphors for the relationship between god and human beings christians are often called servants or slaves of god i am not trying to say that everything in the bible is culturally relative rather i m trying to say that some things are and therefore it is not enough to say that because something appears in the bible that ends the discussion we need to look at whether the action we re talking about now has the same moral implications as the one that the bible was talking about if christians want to argue that there are reasons to think that the prohibitions against homosexuality are still binding i m willing to listen those who claim that the question doesn t need to be looked at are kidding themselves unless they are part of the small minority who really obey all the rules listed above one thing that worries me is the great emotions that this issue creates when you consider the weakness of the biblical evidence some laws in leviticus a passage in rom whose subject matter is really idolatry rather than homosexuality and a couple of lists whose words are ambiguous the amount of concern this is raising among christians seems rather out of proportion this should suggest to people that there are reasons other than simply biblical involved this is true on both sides clearly homosexual christians are as strongly motivated to find ways of discrediting the biblical arguments as conservative christians are to find biblical arguments but i can t help feeling that the bible is being used by both sides as a way of justifying attitudes which come from other sources this is a dangerous situation for christians on the other side of the issue i would like to note some problems i have with the pro homosexual position as it is commonly presented one of the most common arguments is that homosexuality is biologically determined i e god made me homosexual and i have no choice i think god made me homosexual is a fine view for people who already believe on other grounds that homosexuality is acceptable but i don t see it as an argument for acceptability many people think that alcholism is largely biological and drug addiction may turn out to be as well that doesn t mean it s ok most of us have particular things we tend to do wrong some people get angry easily others tend to be arrogant others tend to be attraced to women who are married to someone else homosexuality if we view it as wrong wouldn t be different than any of these other things if we are going to follow god we all end up at one time or another having to work to overcome bad habits and particular temptations that cause us problems none of us can sit back and say that because god made us the way we are we can just relax as jesus said we all have to take up our cross daily this concept of dying to self which also appears throughout paul s letters seems to suggest that there are going to be things about ourselves that we we are called on not to accept paul s letters and the experience of christians throughout history show us that sin is ingrained in us and the battle against it is lifelong and difficult the fact that homosexuality is difficult to fight doesn t necessarily say it s ok maybe this isn t the place where we have to die to self but i d like to make sure that those who think it isn t are fighting the battle somewhere else and not rejecting the concept that all christians have to fight against the deeply engrained habits of sin
baptism requires faith it troubles me that there have been so many posts recently trying to support the doctrine of original sin this is primarily a catholic doctrine with no other purpose than to defend the idea of infant baptism even among its supporters however people will stop short of saying that unbaptised infants will go to hell it s very easy for just about anyone to come up with a partial list of scripture to support any sort of wrong doctrine however if we have the heart to persevere in our beliefs to make sure that they are biblically based then we can come to an understanding of the truth let s now take a more complete look at scripture colossians in him you were also circumcised in the putting off of the sinful nature not with a circumcision done by christ having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the power of god who raised him from the dead in baptism we are raised to a new life in christ romans through a personal faith in the power of god our parent s faith cannot do this do infants have faith let s look at what the bible has to say about it romans but not all the israelites accepted the good news for isaiah says lord who has believed our message consequently faith comes from hearing the message and the message is heard through the word of christ so then we receive god s gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the gospel faith is a possible response to hearing god s word preached kids are not yet spiritually intellectually or emotionally mature enough to respond to god s word hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot be raised in baptism to a new life ezekiel the soul who sins will die the son will not share the guilt of the father nor will the father share the guilt of the son the righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him if you read all of ezekiel you will see that god doesn t hold us guilty for anyone else s sins so we can have no original guilt from adam ezekiel rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted and get a new heart and a new spirit why will you die o house of israel for i take no pleasure in the death of anyone declares the sovereign lord repent and live the way to please god is to repent and get a new heart and spirit kids cannot do this acts says that when we repent and are baptized we will then receive a new spirit the holy spirit then we shall live now then that we have a little more background as to why original sin is not biblical let s look at some of the scriptures used to support it romans therefore just as sin entered the world through one man and death through sin and in this way death came to all men because all sinned sin and death entered the world when the first man sinned death came to each man because each man sinned note that it s good to read through all of romans some of the verses are easier to misunderstand than others but if we read them in context we will see that they are all saying basically the same thing let s look at one such romans for just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous through the disobedience of each individual each was made a sinner in the same way through the obedience of jesus each will be made righteous we must remember when reading through this passage that death came to each man only because each man sinned not because of guilt from adam otherwise the bible would contradict itself i encourage you to read through this whole passage on your own looking at it from this point of view to see if it doesn t all fit together psalm surely i was sinful at birth sinful from the time my mother conceived me this whole psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselves before god in repentance for sinning david himself was a man after god s own heart and wrote the psalm after committing adultry with bathsheba and murdering her husband all that david is saying here is that he can t remember a time when he wasn t sinful he is humbling himself before god by confessing his sinfulness his saying that he was sinful at birth is a hyperbole the bible being inspired by god isn t limited to a literal interpetation but also uses figures of speech as did jesus john for another example of hyperbole see luke now then even though people see that baptism requires faith and that original sin is not biblical they will still argue that infant baptism is necessary because children sin by being selfish not sharing toys with other children by being mean hitting others and fighting etc certainly we have observed children doing wrong things but my gut feeling is always that they don t know any better let s look to see if the bible agrees with my gut feelings isaiah therefore the lord himself will give you a sign the virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son and will call him immanuel he will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right now just about any church leader will tell you that this is a prophecy about jesus if they don t then point them to matthew and find a new leader jesus certainly couldn t have had less knowledge than normal human babies yet this passage says that he had to mature to a certain extent before he would know the difference between right and wrong we see that he did grow and become wiser in luke and the implication is that jesus did wrong things as a child before he knew to choose right over wrong since we know that jesus was perfect without sin we have rather conclusive proof that babies cannot sin because they don t know to choose the right instead of the wrong jesus himself was baptized albeit with john s baptism not as an infant but as a thirty year old man luke and started his ministry as soon as he was baptized luke immediately afterwards he was tempted by the devil luke matthew mark thank you for your attention moderator this should finish up the subject for a while perhaps you would like to make a faq out of this response so that you can repost it from time to time when the topic comes up feel free to rearrange the contents if you would like to but please send me a copy of the final faq sincerely aaron cardenas aaronc athena mit edu i think you re overly optimistic about the authoritative quality of your response first original sin is not a catholic only doctrine it was held by luther and calvin as well and is still present in one form or another in the lutheran and reformed traditions second saying that it has no other purpose than defending infant baptism is an ad hominem argument which has considerable evidence against it the original baptist theology included original sin and some baptists still hold it and there are certainly groups that baptize infants without believing in original sin among protestants the sacraments tend to be a bit more symbolic than among catholics protestants who baptize infants see baptism as a sign of god s acceptance of us rather than our acceptance of god in traditional protestant theology god s grace precedes our response and is applicable to children there are a number of passages one can cite to indicate that god accepts even children clh
re atheists and hell imagine the worst depth of despair you ve ever encountered or the worst physical pain you ve ever experienced some people suffer such emotional physical and mental anguish in their lives that their deaths seem to be merciful but at least the pain does end in death what if you lived a hundred such lives at the conclusion of one you were instantly reborn into another what if you lived a million a billion years in this state what if this kept going forever did this happen to jesus i don t think so not from what i heard he lived one day of suffering and died if the wages of sin is the above paragraph then jesus didn t pay for our sins did he this is something i ve always found a little curious i ve never quite understood the trinity thing on the one hand jesus is supposed to be god incarnate but at the same time he is god s son for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son first question is if jesus was god in human form how could he really be god s son if the holy ghost planted the seed in mary so to speak then it seems that jesus relationship to god would be the equivalent to the human father son relationship while a son might inherit alot of the father s qualities he is not the father they are still two separite entities to try and say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong in that case jesus and god aren t the same on the other hand if their relationship isn t the same as the human father son relationship but jesus is actually god incarnate then he s not really god s son and he never was he s just god manifesting himself as jesus at least this is how i m seeing it can someone who is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us getting back to the original question what is the great price that jesus paid to redeem our sins was it dying on the cross since jesus knew that he would rise again in days and then ascend back to heaven i have a hard time seeing how this is considered paying such a great price for humanity his earthly body may have been killed but then so what he suffered a few hours of physical pain but then there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more the fact that jesus was god s only begotten son doesn t seem to me to have much meaning since god can beget as many sons as he wants to jesus being the only one was simply a matter of choice i suspect that these questions will be very offensive to many christians on this net to those people please accept my sincere apologies it is not my intention to offend or to trivialize christ but i do believe these are legitimate questions and i am genuinely curious note that the trinity and incarnation have to be looked at together first your reading of the virgin birth is an uncommon one in this group it s dangerous to say that no one believes something you seem to be suggesting the jesus is god s son in a physical sense with the holy spirit as father and mary as mother i consider that terrible heresy though some people react less violently the virgin birth says that jesus birth is god s responsibility but it doesn t imply that god s sperm was involved indeed one though by no means the only speculation is that god used joseph s genetic material second jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the father in a trinitarian context the term son refers to the eternal logos who is a part of god the son didn t come into existence with jesus birth jesus is the incarnation of the son so his sonness isn t specifically a result of being incarnated rather it s the son who was incarnated clh
christianity and repeated lives there is a paragraph in the new testament which in my opinion clearly makes a positive inference to reincarnation i don t remember which one it is off of the top of my head but it basically goes like this jesus is talking with the apostles and they ask him why the pharisees say that before the messiah can come elijah must first come jesus replies that elijah has come but they did not recognize him it then says that the apostles perceived that he was refering to john the baptist this seems to me to clearly imply reincarnation this was a popular belief in the judaism of jesus time that elijah would return again as he had been taken in to heaven in a chariot and did not actually die however jesus was referring to john the baptist not in the sense that elijah was reincarnated as john remember elijah didn t die but that john was a similar prophet to elijah john was a fiery preacher he wore sackcloth and wandered rough through israel preaching the coming kingdom the verses that describe him in mark s gospel can be linked to ot references about elijah hence john was similar to elijah and jesus was drawing the parallels between the two just as he drew parallels with the suffering servant in isaiah and other messianic figures and himself a brief reply but i don t have time to look up all the relevant stuff suffice to say there is a very strong explanation rick richard johnston queen s university malone road belfast belfast northern ireland bt sb u athmail causeway qub ac uk

virtues of purity modesty and innocence heres a nice story to help explain the virtues of purity innocence and modesty and their importance the most beautiful virtues this story is an excerpt taken from the basket of flowers by johann christoph von schmid in a certain little market town over a hundred years ago there lived an upright and intelligent man named jacob rede he was married to a most virtuous young woman and they lived happily in a humble home which was in the midst of a large beautiful val ley after living many happy years together jacob s wife died leaving him alone with only one friend his daughter mary even as a child mary was uncommonly pretty but as she grew in years her piety her innocence her modesty and her unfeigned kindne ss towards all she came in contact with gave to her beauty a rare and peculiar charm her face was lighted up with a look of such indescribable goodness that it seemed almost as though one looked upon an angel mary s greatest delight was the beautiful garden and her favour ite flowers were the violet the lily and the rose jacob loved to point to them as emblems of the virtues most becoming to her gender when she once early in march brought the first violet to him and joyfully called upon him to admire it he said let the modest violet my dear mary be to you an image of humil ity and of the benevolence that does good in secret it clothes itself in the tender colours of modesty it prefers to bloom in retired grots it fills the air with its fragrance while remain ing hidden beneath the leaves may you also my dear mary be like the retiring violet avoiding vain display not seeking to attract the public eye but preferring ever to do good in quietude and peace one morning when the roses and lilies were in full bloom and the garden appeared in its richest array jacob said to his daughter as he pointed out a beautiful lily which was beaming in the morning sun let the lily my dear child be to you the emblem of purity look how beautiful how pure and fair it is the whi test linen is as nothing compared with the purity of its petals they are like the snow happy the maiden whose heart is as pure and as free from stain but the purest of all colours is also the hardest to preserve pure easily is the petal of the lily soiled touch it but carelessly or roughly and a stain is left behind in the same way a word or a thought may stain the purity of innocence then pointing to a rose he said let the rose my dear mary be to you an emblem of modesty more beautiful than the colour of the rose is the blush that rises to the cheek of a modest girl it is a sign that she is still pure of heart and innocent in thought happy is the maiden whom the suggestion of a thought that is indelicate will cause to blush as she is thus put on her guard against the approach of danger the cheeks which readily blush will remain for a long time with their roseate hue while those which fail to blush at the least indelicacy of thought will soon become pale and wan and go before their time to the grave among the many fruit trees that adorned the garden there was one that was prized above all the others it was an apple tree not much larger than a rose bush and stood by itself in the middle of the garden mary s father had planted it the day that she was born and every year it bore a number of beautiful apples once it blossomed earlier than usual and with unusual luxuriance the tree was one mass of blossom mary was so delighted with it that she went every morning as soon as she was dressed to look at it once when it was in full bloom she called to her father and said look father how beautiful was there ever such a lovely mingling of red and white the whole tree looks like one huge bunch of flowers the next morning she hastened into the garden to feast her eyes once more upon the tree but what was her grief to see that the frost had nipped it and destroyed all its flowers they were all become brown and yellow and when the sun came forth in its strength they withered and fell to the ground mary wept bitter tears at the sight then said the father thus does sinful pleasure destroy the bloom of youth oh my child never cease to remember how dreadful it is to be seduced from the path of right behold in the example of the apple tree an image of what would happen if you were to wander from the way if the hopes your conduct hitherto has raised in my heart should vanish not merely for a day or year but for life ah then how much more bitter would be the tears which i would shed over your lapse from virtue than those which now course down your cheeks life would have no joys for me with tears in my eyes i should go down sorrowfully to my grave as he spoke the tears stood in his eyes mary was deeply moved and the words he uttered made so profound an impression upon her mind that she never forgot them under the eyes of a father so loving and wise and amid the flowers of her garden mary grew daily in stature and intelli gence blooming as a rose pure as a lily and retiring as a violet and as full of promise as a tree laden with blossom happy was the old man at all times to behold how plenteously the fruits of his garden rewarded his diligent toil but with how much more happiness and content did he mark the gracious effect produced upon the heart and mind of his beloved daughter by his pious teaching and example jacob plucked several roses and lilies tied them together in a bunch and gave them to mary with the words the lily and the rose sister flowers as they are belong the one to the other both incomparable in their beauty they are ren dered still more lovely by being together in the same way my dear child are innocence and modesty twin sisters of virtue and cannot be separated the greatest

hate the sin hate the sin but love the sinner i ve heard that quite a bit recently often in the context of discussions about christianity and homosexuality but the context really isn t that important my question is whether that statement is consistent with christianity i would think not hate begets more hate never love consider some sin i ll leave it unnamed since i don t want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not something is a sin now lets apply our hate the sin philosophy and see what happens if we truly hate the sin then the more we see it the stronger our hatred of it will become eventually this hate becomes so strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate the sinner in addition our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and do things which are taken personally by the sinner who often does not even believe what they are doing is a sin after enough of this the sinner begins to hate us they certainly don t love us for our constant criticism of their behavior hate builds up and drives people away from god this certainly cannot be a good way to build love in the summary of the law christ commands us to love god and to love our neighbors he doesn t say anything about hate in fact if anything he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves so how are christians supposed to deal with the sin of others i suppose that there is only one way to deal with sin either in others or ourselves through prayer we need to ask god to help us with our own sin and to help those we love with theirs only love can conquer sin hatred has no place the best way to love someone is to pray for them scott this is my signature there are many like it but this one is mine scott holt internet scott prism gatech edu georgia tech uucp gatech prism scott office of information technology technical services

re mormon beliefs about bastards erh tesla njit edu writes could anyone enlighten me on how the mormon church views children born out of wedlock in particular i m interested to know if any stigma is attached to the children as opposed to the parents all children are born pure i e without sin however most saints would view a pregnancy outside of marriage as an occasion of mourning some church members would be much more judgmental but that is their problem in situations where welfare assistance is provided through our church bishops usually require that the family be making some effort to live the gospel standards and provide for themselves however there are occasions when assistance is provided because of the children in the home as a former bishop of mine said children are always worthy before god i m especially keen to learn if there is or is not any prohibition in the mormon faith on bastards entering heaven or having their names entered in the big genealogical book the mormons keep in salt lake city i am not sure what you mean by the term bastards in this context latter day saints believe that through the temple ordinances the family unit may be preserved in eternity if you use genealogical material or software produced by the church you may notice a section for temple ordinances within that section there should be a spot for signifying bic which stands for born in the covenant the children born to couple sealed married within the temple are born in the covenant and are eligible to be part of that eternal family unit children born to other couples whether in a civil marriage or not would have to be sealed to their parents after their marriage is solemnized for eternity supposing a child were born to a woman out of wedlock he or she could be sealed to his or her parents at a later date or adopted into any eternal family unit which may include one of the birth parents if this is an issue on which the official position has changed over time i m interested in learning both old and new beliefs e mail or posting is fine all information or pointers are appreciated i can t say if this principle of adoption was revealed at the same time as the sealing ordinances but it has been accepted for the years i have been in the church i would tend to discount any admonitions from the church authorities against having children out of wedlock because even though there are provisions within the lord s plan to recover what we have done wrong the church does not want to give anyone the impression we can sin and repent at our leisure a idler

re what was the immaculate conception in article may geneva rutgers edu joe moore writes speaking of the immaculate conception of the blessed virgin it was a gift from god i think basically the reasoning was that the tradition in the church held that mary was also without sin as was jesus yes for examples of this in the writings of the early fathers consider you alone and your mother are more beautiful than any others for there is no blemish in you nor any stains upon your mother who of my children can compare in beauty to these st ephrem the syrian nisibene hymns around a d lift me up not from sara but from mary a virgin not only undefiled but a virgin whom grace has made inviolate free of every stain of sin st ambrose commentary on psalm ca a d there are many others as the tenets of faith developed particularly with augustine sin was more and more equated with sex and thus mary was assumed to be a virgin for life since she never sinned and since she was the spouse of god etc no we have for instance was there ever anyone of any breeding who dared to speak the name of holy mary and being questioned did not immediately add the virgin and to holy mary virgin is invariably added for that holy woman remains undefiled st epiphanus of salamis panacea against all heresies between a d we surely cannot deny that you were right in correcting the doctrine about children of mary for the lord jesus would not have chosen to be born of a virgin if he had judged that she would be so incontinent as to taint the birthplace of the body of the lord home of the eternal king with the seed of human intercourse anyone who proposes this is merely proposing that christ could not be born of a virgin pope st siricius letter to anysius bishop of thessalonica a d note that st augustine s conversion to christianity was in a d i don t know offhand when his election as bishop of hippo was but i m quite sure it was after the belief in mary s perpetual virginity originated long before augustine s time we hold that it originated with the apostles strictly speaking however mary s perpetual virginity is independent of her immaculate conception mary could have been immaculately conceived and not remained a virgin she could have remained a virgin and not been immaculately conceived since we also had this notion of original sin ie that man is born with a predisposition to sin and since mary did not have this predisposition because she did not ever sin she didn t have original sin when science discovered the process of conception the next step was to assume that mary was conceived without original sin the immaculate conception no it has been held in the church since ancient times that original sin was transmitted at conception when a person s life begins biology had nothing to do with it prayerfully reflecting on the truth of mary s sinlessness and the means by which god could have achieved this the church arrived at the truth of the immaculate conception thus the immaculate conception is not a new doctrine but the logical result of our understanding of two old ones the celebration of the feast of the immaculate conception itself was given by pope sixtus iv and the feast was made a precept feast of the church by pope clement xi mary at that time appeared to a girl named bernadette at lourdes she refered to herself as the immaculate conception since a nine year old would have no way of knowing about the doctrine the apparition was deemed to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine no first of all lourdes is private revelation and doctrine is not based on private revelation the most that private revelation can do is enhance and deepen our understanding of existing public revelation which ended with the death of st john the apostle second the case for the doctrine was irreformably sealed in with the ex cathedra promulgation of the bull ineffabilis deus by pope pius ix this meant that the doctrine was formally recognized as a dogma a dogma by definition cannot change and is required to be believed by the faithful the apparition at lourdes happened in four years later the most that might be claimed is that lourdes gave the infallible proclamation of a sort of heavenly stamp of approval but the church has never claimed that nor shall she in christ s peace brad kaiser bradk isdgsm eurpd csg mot com those who trust in him shall understand truth and the faithful shall abide with him in love because grace and mercy are with his holy ones and his care is with his elect wis nab

definition of christianity i have enrolled in the history of christianity at a college here in st louis the teacher of the class is what i consider to be closed minded and bigotted on the subject of what the definition of christianity is his definition is tied directly to that of the trinity and the catholic church s definition of it and belief in jesus christ is not sufficient to call one s self a christian while his saying it doesn t make it so i nevertheless feel insulted or am i just neurotic i would like to be able to respond to him with some sense of literacy while maintaining an amiable student teacher relationship so is there common definition of what christianity is as the previous discussion of the trinity did not lend itself to an exchange of flames i am hopeful that this will also not produce major flames regards larry autry silicon graphics st louis autry sgi com often we get into discussions about who is christian unfortunately there are a number of possible definitions starting from the broadest commonly used definitions are a historical definition people who accept christ as lord and savior a broad doctrinal definition narrow doctrinal definitions by a historical definition i mean the sort of definition a secular historian would likely use this would include any group that developed out of the christian church and continues within the same broad culture e g some unitarians would fail just about any doctrinal test you could come up with yet it s clear that that group developed from christianity and people from very different backgrounds e g hindus would likely see them as part of christianity this is not a definition most christians like but it s relevant in some political and ethnic contexts accepting christ as lord and savior is a test used by many christian groups for membership e g the southern baptists and presbyterian church usa i would qualify it by saying that what most people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to christ so that someone who accepted christ as one of many gods would not fit it s an attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based on technical doctrine by this definition groups such as arians would be viewed as heretical christians but still christians in the modern context this would include mormons jw s and oneness pentecostals they would be viewed as heretical christians but still christian in practice i believe just about everyone who falls into this category would accept the apostle s creed the next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition which includes all of the major strands of christianity but excludes groups that are felt to be outside historic christianity this is of course a slippery enterprise since catholics could argue that protestants are outside historic christianity etc but i think the most commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the nicene creed and the formula of chalcedon the attempt is to characterize doctrines that all major strands of christianity agree are key obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement a mormon will regard the lds church as a major strand and thus will not want to include anything that contradicts their beliefs but i think this definition would have fairly broad acceptance finally some people use definitions that i would say are limited to a specific christian tradition e g some evangelicals only consider someone christian if he has had an evangelical style conversion experience and some i ve even heard of groups that limit it to their specific church i think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used a lot is going to depend upon the purpose you re using it for if you re using it descriptively e g in history or anthropology you ll probably use definition or if you re using it normatively i e to say what you believe the christian message is you ll probably use a definition like or even clh

re the doctrine of original sin eugene bigelow ebay sun com geno writes joseph h buehler writes this all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults since both have souls infants must be baptized therefore or they cannot enter into heaven they too need this form of life in them or they cannot enter into heaven are you saying that baptism has nothing to do with asking jesus to come into your heart and accepting him as your savior but is just a ritual that we must go through to enable us to enter heaven my feeling on baptism is this parents baptize their baby so that the baby has the sanctifying grace of baptism and thus removal of original sin on its soul in the event of an unexpected death that is the parents speak on behalf of the child which is too young to speak on its own this should not surprise anyone don t parents always do what they believe is the best for their baby why would that apply to the baby s physical needs only but not his her spiritual needs to have god s grace the purpose of confirmation is for the baby now young adult to decide to re affirm for himself herself the promises that his her parents made at baptism that is where accepting jesus into your heart comes in in baptism the parents ask jesus to come into their baby s heart at confirmation the child repeats that request independently by the way these are my personal feelings though i believe they are pretty close to what the doctrinal position of the catholic church on this issue can anyone out there back me up or correct me
re mary s assumption mpaul unl edu marxhausen paul writes i hate to sound flippant having shot off my mouth badly on the net before but i m afraid that much of this material only adds to my feeling that the assumption of mary would be better phrased our assumptions about mary in all the time i ve been reading about mary on this group i can not recall reading much about mary that did not sound like wishful veneration with scant if any scriptural foundation i find in the new testament a very real portrait of christ s parents as compellingly human persons to be honored and admired for their humility and submission to god s working beyond doubt but the almalga mation of theories and dogma that has accreted around them gives me an image of alien and inhuman creatures untouched by sin or human desire only christ himself was so truly sanctified and even he knew temptation albeit without submitting to it i also don t see the necessity of saying the holy parents were some how sanctified beyond normal humanity it sounds like our own inability to grasp the immensity of god s grace in being incarnated through an or dinary human being i won t start yelling about how people are worshipping mary etc since folks have told me otherwise about that but i do think we lose part of the wonder of god s incarnation in christ when we make his parents out to be sinless sexless deathless otherworldly beings paul marxhausen paul you did a wonderful job of not doing anything humany possible to offend us catholics hopefully i can be just as careful in my wording as you were i also don t want to extend this topic into an entire major issue of debate anymore than it already is but just a note or two please don t talk about jesus parents the doctrinal positions of the church an unequivocally different regarding mary and joseph i personally have never heard of anything being attributed to st joseph other than his sainthood that is no reference ever to him being sinless assumed into heaven immaculately conceived etc all these ideas apply only to mary i would agree there is very little scriptural evidence for our doctrines about mary needless to say that presents a significant problem to those who accept the bible as the only source of doctrine if however one turns to the sacred traditions of the undivided christian church there is no problem finding plently of evidence that it was basically a unanimous belief among the apostles and all the early generation that mary was assumed into heaven body and soul etc etc it wasn t until the reformation that these doctrines were called into question as far as i am concerned again my personaly feelings if it s a choice between the apostles or luther i ll choose the apostles every time whether or not it is recorded within the writings that the traditions of men have determined to be the bible like a said just a couple of notes as is often said i believe that we must agree to politely disagree may god s peace and blessings be with you always in your search to discover his absolute truth mike walker mdw uxa cso uiuc edu univ of illinois
new thought on deuterocanonicals often times most recently on this list in the last few days i ve heard the passage from revelation whoever adds to the sacred words of this book whoever removes words from this book used as an arguement against the deutercanonical books i feel this is ridiculous for two reasons they weren t added later by the catholic church they were always part of what was considered inspired scripture this has been dealt with in previous postings no reason to repeat the info it is more likely than not that when st john or whomever wrote the book of revelation what was then considered scripture was not the same thing you and i are holding in our hands if one takes the translation of this book in rev or somewhere around there to mean all of scripture then all of us are likely holding something that is in violation of this command it is impossible to exactly date the scriptures even the n t ones they didn t like to date their letters i guess i really wish i had my bible with me right now to get the facts straight but i believe that several of the n t letters chief among them peter have their most likely date of composition in the early second century a d revelation was almost certainly written durin the reign of domition sp a d thus it could be argues that we are all in sin if we accept peter as scripture since it was added to the book after the composition of revelation when we are told to add nothing more if you want to get the exact dates get a copy of the new american bible i ll try to follow this up tomorrow if i remember mike walker mdw uxa cso uiuc edu univ of illinois

two nits picked gerry palo writes between adam and eve and golgotha the whole process of the fall of man occurred this involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual world this is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through history the greek for example could say better a beggar in the land of the living than a king in the land of the dead iliad i think i would not swear that nothing of the sort is found in the iliad but the first passage i thought of was the odyssey or thereabouts my copy has no line numbers the ghost of acchilles speaks robert fitzgerald translation better i say to break sod as a farm hand for some poor country man on iron rations than lord it over all the exhausted dead the next passage i thought of was from ecclesiastes a living dog is better than a dead lion on the other hand there is one notion firmly embedded in christianity that originated most definitely in a pagan source the idea that the human being consists essentially of soul only and that the soul is created at birth was consciously adopted from aristotle whose ideas dominated christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does today surely aristotle had little influence on christian thought before about ad yours james kiefer
bernadette dates joe moore writes mary at that time appeared to a girl named bernadette at lourdes she referred to herself as the immaculate conception since a nine year old would have no way of knowing about the doctrine the apparition was deemed to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine bernadette was years old when she had her visions in four years after the dogma had been officially proclaimed by the pope yours james kiefer
re satanic tounges in article may athos rutgers edu bjorn b larsen delab sintef no writes we chose to believe whetever we want but we are not allowed to define our own christianity we see in parts if you see something that i do not see or vice versa it does not give me the right to play jokes on your belief it is important if christianity is being damaged by it if people who speak in tongues make claims that they are miraculously speaking a foreign language through the power of the holy spirit when it can easily be shown that they are simply making noises it damages all christians since many who are not christians do not distinguish between the various sects the more modest claim for tongues that it is simply uncontrolled praise in which words fail you is surely the one that should be used by those who make use of this practice i agree with the point that charismatic practices like this can lead to forms of worship which are more about the worshipper showing off than genuine praise for god one of the things jesus warned us about matthew huntbach
jacob and esau gerry palo wrote that there is nothing in christianity that excludes the theory of a succession of lives i wrote that the apostle paul in romans speaks of god as choosing jacob over esau and adds that this is not as a result of anything that either child had done since they had not been born yet clearly paul does not believe that they had had previous lives nor does he suppose that his readers will believe it for if they had had previous lives it would not make sense to say neither of them has done anything good or bad as yet since they are not yet born daniel cossack writes to ask whether it is fair for god to hate easau when esau has done nothing bad i reply that in hebrew it is standard usage to speak of hating when what is meant is simply putting in second place as an example consider the saying in matthew no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or now it is obviously false that a man with two masters must hate one of them but it is obviously true that he must put one of them in second place a dog that always comes when either billy or bobby calls will have a problem if they stand in different places and call simultaneously it cannot give first priority to both one must take second place in our original example second place means that jacob not esau is chosen to bear the covenant blessing and obligation and to be the ancestor of christ eugene bigelow mentions matthew which says of john the baptist and if ye will receive it this is elijah who was to come i take this to mean that john was an elijah like figure dressing and living like elijah preaching like elijah and fulfilling the prediction that elijah would prepare the way for the messiah i do not think that he was elijah in a literal sense and appareently neither did he john yours james kiefer
rfd soc religion taize this is a rfd on a proposal for a newsgroup which would promote a sharing on the johannine hours as proposed each month by the monks of the ecumenical community of taize pronounced te zay in france name of proposed newsgroup soc religion taize unmoderated purpose of the group the taize community is an international ecumenical community of monks based in france many young adults come there to search for meaning in their life and to deepen their understanding of their faith through a sharing with others this newsgroup will allow such a sharing through a monthly johannine hour which will be posted at the beginning of each month a johannine hour involves a short commentary on a given bible passage followed by some questions for reflection any thoughts that may arise in consequence and that you wish to share with others can be posted here we are not interested in theological debate and even less in polemics no expertise is required the idea is to help one another to deepen our understanding of scripture as it is related to our own life journey the idea of johannine hours was born in taize as a simple response to all those who were trying to assimilate the bible s message in the midst of their daily life because of work or studies it is often impossible to spend long hours in silence and reflection but everyone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church sit quietly at home or go out for a walk in the woods there in silence we can meditate on a passage of scripture to listen to the voice of christ during the time of silence it is important to concentrate on what we understand and not waste time worrying if in some biblical expressions we find it difficult to hear the voice of christ the idea is to communicate to others what we have understood of christ not burdening them with our own hesitations but rather telling them what has brought us joy what has led us to run the risk of trusting more deeply perhaps those who read and think about the johannine hours in this newsgroup could share their reflections and discoveries with others the important thing is the complementarity between two aspects the personal aspect of silent personal reflection and the communal aspect of sharing which through usenet makes us a part of a worldwide network background of the taize community the following provides some background information on the life and vocation of the taize pronounced te zay community a parable of communion august with europe in the grip of world war ii brother roger aged set up home in the almost abandoned village of taize in eastern france his dream to bring together a monastic community which would live out a parable of community a sign of reconciliation in the midst of the distress of the time centering his life on prayer he used his house to conceal refugees especially jews fleeing from the nazi occupation an international and ecumenical community taize s founder spent the first two years alone others joined him later and at easter seven brothers committed themselves together to common life and celibacy year by year still others have entered the community each one making a lifelong commitment after several years of preparation today there are brothers catholics and from various protestant backgrounds from over twenty different countries some of them are living in small groups in poor neighbourhoods in asia africa north and south america the brothers accept no donations or gifts for themselves not even family inheritances and the community holds no capital the brothers earn their living and share with others entirely through their own work in sisters of saint andrew an international catholic community founded years ago came to live in the neighbouring village to share the responsibility of welcoming people in taize taize and the young the intercontinental meetings young adults and less young have been coming to taize in ever greater numbers since hundreds of thousands of people from europe and far beyond have thus been brought together in a common search intercontinental meetings take place each week sunday to sunday throughout the year and they include youth from between and countries during any one week the meetings give each person the opportunity to explore the roots of their faith and to reflect on how to unite the inner life and human solidarity the meetings in summer can have up to participants a week three times every day the brothers and everybody on the hill come together for common prayer in the church of reconciliation built in when the village church became too small a pilgrimage of trust on earth the community has never wanted to create a movement around itself instead people are called to commit themselves in their church at home in their neighbourhood their city or village to support them in this taize has created what it calls a pilgrimage of trust on earth at the end of each year the pilgrimage has a european meeting which brings together tens of thousands of young adults from every part of europe for several days in a major city there have also been meetings in asia and in the united states every year brother roger writes an open letter to the young usually completed during a stay in one of the poor regions of the world these are translated into thirty languages and provide themes for reflexion for the following year note discussion on the creation of this newsgroup will take place in news groups for any further information contact brother roy almac co uk brother roy almac co uk st b taize community taize

eternal marriage was mormon temples in article may athos rutgers edu dhammers pacific david hammerslag writes this paragraph brought to mind a question how do you mormons reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with christ s statement that in the ressurection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage luke chapt well here is something i wrote some time ago in response to a similar question i hope it helps begin repeat of previous post as for the scripture mentioned i agree that it does seem to be a problem not only for eternal marriage but marriage in general luke s version has jesus saying that the children of this world marry and are given in marriage but not those who will attain the kingdom of heaven it almost sounds like marriage disqualifies one for salvation matthew and mark both omit this statement i think the accounts are not as clear as they might be let s have a look at the incident and see if we can come up with some reasonable ideas of what it means the scriptures involved are mat mark and luke what happened was that the sadducees who did not believe in the resurrection thought they could trap jesus they made reference to the leverite marriage which required the brother of a man who died without children to take the widow to wife and raise up children the children would be considered children of the deceased just as though the woman s first husband had fathered them it seems obvious from this that the woman was still considered in a way to be the wife of her first husband however the sadducees concocted a scene in which brothers of the deceased each in his turn failed to father children by the widow they seem to imply that the leverite marriage was equal to the first for they ask whose wife shall she be in the resurrection at this point it seems obvious that if she is anybody s wife it is the first husband after all had she borne children they would have been credited to him regardless of which brother was the biological father it is possible jesus was refering to this when he says ye do err not knowing the scriptures or the power of god mat compare mark phrase not in luke s account anyway the sadducees ask whose wife will she be in the resurrection seeing that all had her jesus answer is that in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage mat when they rise from the dead they neither marry mark they which are accounted worthy to obtain that world neither marry luke all accounts go on to say but are as the angels in heaven or the equivalent i find this last not very helpful since the bible does not define angels nor give any idea what their life is like some ministers claim that they are sexless different that humans etc but i can find no biblical support for this i think what jesus is saying here and it is clearest in matthew s and mark s accounts is that marriages will not be performed in the resurrection this goes along with our belief that if a person is to marry at all it must be done on this earth however we do believe that a marriage performed by the authority of god can be binding in eternity in fact the first marriage appears to have been performed by god himself before death entered the world in the garden of eden what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder mat jesus also told peter and the other apostles that whatsoever they should bind on earth should be bound in heaven mat i believe that this also refers to marriages performed by the proper authority

re dreams and out of body incidents dt cs hub ucsb edu david e goggin writes i m fairly new to these groups tho some have heard from me before welcome i d like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a lot what morals ethics apply to dreams and out of body incidents in normal dreams you can t control anything so obviously you aren t morally responsible for your actions hm i get a little queasy around the phrase aren t morally responsible perhaps because i ve heard it misused so many times i remember in college some folk trying to argue that a person who was drunk was not morally responsible for his actions in general most folk can t control their dreams but perhaps what you do all day and think about has some impact on them hm and i m not sure what actions are in a dream but i will note that jesus does seem adamant about the fact that our thought life is at least as important as our actions go lightly with this argument we are all morally responsible for who we are and dreams might well be an important part of that now there seem to be alternatives dreams and oobes are totally mental phenomena in this case no morality applies beyond what might be called mental hygiene that is not trying to think about anything evil or indulgining in overly sexy or violent thoughts i don t know a thing about out of body experiences i ve had dreams some fairly vivid ones is an oobe just a very vivid dream i would argue that extreme interest in this sort of phenomena is a tad risky it is probably much better to think about who jesus is and who we are in relation to that than to cultivate a strong interest in dreams unless you feel plagued by dreams that are painful and out of control then pray about it and or get help dreams and oobes have a reality of their own i e are another plane evidence for this is that often dreams and oobes are sometimes done in common by more than one person what on earth is your definition of often i know exactly one case of two people who had substantially the same dream at the same time and as they were brothers who had spent the day doing the same things i could see why their dreams might be similiar anyway the only other plane i know of is the spiritual realm i don t think anyone s dreams perhaps outside the occasional prophet s represent actual actions on an alternate plane if they were real actions or conscious thoughts then yes they would have direct moral significance like but here we assume that garbled text because the dream occurs in a different environment then different moral laws apply is my guess of what you said i don t see the slightest hint in christian writings that ones environment changes the way a person determines what is moral for a christian won t it always come down to what jesus would have us do so there it is is one of these cases the truth or does anyone know of another alternative respond by post or email truth i don t claim to be an expert in dreams i ll note that the bible doesn t talk much about dreams outside of the realm of god using them to speak to us with the caveat that such messages are not always very clear as it warns somewhere in the ot given that i would not give them a lot of attention unless you feel your dreams are trying to tell you something i would discount talk of alternate planes though the only places such concepts are commonly bandied about are for the most part hostile to christianity though i ve run into the occasional exception if you are or want to be a christian you want to be very careful about ideas like this

re the doctrine of original sin in article may athos rutgers edu eugene bigelow ebay sun com writes this all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults since both have souls infants must be baptized therefore or they cannot enter into heaven they too need this form of life in them or they cannot enter into heaven are you saying that baptism has nothing to do with asking jesus to come into your heart and accepting him as your savior but is just a ritual that we must go through to enable us to enter heaven i don t think joe was saying any such thing however your question on asking jesus to come into your heart seems to imply that infants are not allowed to have christ in theirs why must baptism always be viewed by some people as a sort of prodigal son type of thing i e a sudden change of heart going from not accepting christ to suddenly accepting christ why can t people start out with christ from shortly after birth and build their relationship from there after all does a man suddenly meet a woman and then marry her that same day from my experiences i ve learned that all relationships must be built including one s relationship with god also joe is speaking from the standpoint that baptism is not just a ritual but that through it god bestows sacramental grace upon the recipient certainly for those with the mental faculties to know christ it is necessary to believe in him however the sacrament itself bestows grace on the recipient and makes a permanent mark of adoption into god s family on the soul steve creps indiana university creps lateran ucs indiana edu
more on peter i wrote that i thought that peter meant no prophecy of scripture or as one reader suggests no written prophecy is merely the private opinion of the writer tony zamora replies sat may that this in turn implies that it is not subject to the private interpretation of the reader either i am not sure that i understand this in one sense no statement by another is subject to my private interpretation if reliable historians tell me that the athenians lost the pelopennesian war i cannot simply interpret this away because i wanted the athenians to win facts are facts and do not go away because i want them to be otherwise in another sense every statement is subject to private interpretation in that i have to depend on my brains and expereience to decide what it means and whether it is sufficiently well attested to merit my assent even if the statement occurs in an inspired writing i still have to decide using my own best judgement whether it is in fact inspired this is not arrogance it is just an inescapable fact yours james kiefer

re homosexual issues in christianity there s some ambiguity about the meaning of the words in the passage you quote both liberal and conservative sources seem to agree that homosexual is not the general term for homosexuals but is likely to have a meaning like homosexual prostitute from what i understand of my experience in looking up this word and discussing it with a greek literate individual the meaning of the word is rather clear basically it literally means he who beds with a man or he who has sex with a man the burden of proof is on the pro homosexuality side of the argument to show that the word has an idiomatic meaning nor evident from its literal meaning one can speculate all day long that it might mean something else but we need evidence before we create new doctrines and get rid of the historical understanding of the meaning of this word link hudson i ve read enough discussions of this passage in both liberal and conservative sources to be sure that the meaning even the literal meaning is not certain that doesn t mean one can t come to some conclusion nor does it mean that i think there s any doubt about what paul thinks of homosexuality but there are plausible arguments for a couple of different meanings clh

re the arrogance of christians news cbnewsk att com writes arrogance is arrogance it is not the result of religion it is the result of people knowing or firmly believing in an idea and one s desire to show others of one s rightness i assume that god decided to be judge for our sake as much as his own if we allow him who is kind and merciful be the judge we ll probably be better off than if others judged us or we judged ourselves i m not sure i agree with this i agree that arrogance is not the result of religion and that god is a far better judge than we are i also agree if you mean to say that arrogance shows up in the form of trying to prove one s superior knowledge rightness or holiness over another person s beliefs i need to be careful to understand what you mean here so that i do not fall into the mistake of misrepresenting your views if i fall down in this area i hope you will forgive me arrogance is not the result of believing one is right or of believing that one s god is greater than the god s of others or of believing that one s religion is better than other religions these are all naturally self implied beliefs it is self contradictory to say that i believe my current beliefs to be wrong were i to find myself in error my beliefs would naturally change and follow what i believe to be right therefore i must always consider my beliefs correct that s not arrogance that s unavoidable behavior it is nonsense to say that i believe another person s god to be greater than my god were his or her god greater wouldn t i be obligated to change so that their god would become my god we are naturally obligated to worship that god which we deem to be the greatest why should we feel obligated to worship a second best god for the sake of feeling humble arrogance is not necessarily thinking onesself to be better looking or more intelligent or stronger or having more resources than another person no doubt many will have to chew on this one awhile were passive observation of one s superior points arrogance then god would be most arrogant of all humility does not rest in slandering or belittling god s work of creation in our lives people often go around trying to be humble saying to one another i m not very smart i m poor i m not good looking i m just a worm in the ground i m such a weak person and although i don t want to sin i really cannot help it were this person truely humble he would take a different approach god thank you for making me the way you did i know that you never do anything second best yet with all that you have given me i have been so unthankful you ve given me power to resist the devil i have not used it but have indulged myself in doing exactly what you have said not to do i have slandered your creation in my life and have credited myself with humility for doing so lord with all you ve given me i have been completely unfaithful and i do not deserve your forgiveness and yet your love for me is so boundless that you would give yourself to die for me to save me as terribly evil as i am i deserve to go straight to hell yet it pleases you somehow to rescue me from this terrible life i ve led lord please forgive me and help me stay on the right track so that i can bring glory to your name instead of insult lord i m so sorry for my wrongs please help me to change i think people take exceptional offense to religious arrogance because they don t want to be wrong if i find someone arrogant i typically don t have anything to do with them for me i ve often found it hard to tell the difference often times the most humble christian has come across to me as arrogant while the most proud worm in the ground false humility type person has been found to be most comfortable company when i m wrong and arrogant about my wrongness i certainly don t feel like being confronted by my wrongness were someone to confront me verbally with my wrongness i d be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe for all their faults and charge them with hypocricy for what they said to me at the root my desire would be to make them shut up so that i can go about living my life arrogantly as i wish however were someone to confront me silently by their example earn my respect and perhaps mention it to me in humility in private i d feel broken down and challenged to seek god for help in changing from the error of my ways the hard part is getting to the point to where i can be humble before anyone regardless of their humility or pride regardless of their hypocricy or sincerity regardless of whether onlookers will frown down upon me or not it isn t easy to take this pain in love with thankfulness for the opportunity to improve in one s ability to serve god it s easier to cast aside any hope of reaching true humility and merely hide behind slandering god s creation in our lives instead but we should examine ourselves i hope i typed this back in right and why we react to certain situations with such emotions for instance many of us feel justified to be insulted by an arrogant person as if we needed a reason to feel insulted but after being insulted over and over again by the words of others you d

re the doctrine of original sin in article may athos rutgers edu eugene bigelow ebay sun com writes if babies are not supposed to be baptised then why doesn t the bible ever say so it never comes right and says only people that know right from wrong or who are taught can be baptised this is not a very sound argument for baptising babies it assumes that if the bible doesn t say specifically that you don t need to do something then that must mean that you do need to do it i know there s a specific term for this form of logic but it escapes me right now however if it were sound then you should be able to apply it this way if the bible doesn t specifically say that something is wrong then it must be ok which coincidentally leads perfectly into a question i ve often pondered this is no less logical than the assumption that if something is not in the bible then it must not be done but i don t really think that s what he s saying anyway see below if slavery is immoral which i believe it is can i assume that everyone else in this group does too why doesn t jesus or any of the apostles speak out against it owning slaves was common practice back then paul speaks about everything else that is immoral he apparently thought it was important enough to talk about things like not being a drunkard why doesn t anyone mention slavery if god s morals are eternal and don t change like the morals of society then it must have been just as immoral then as it is today what about the letter to philemon in it paul at least hints that a certain slave be released also slavery in those times was not the same as the type of slavery we had in the u s i think a better comparison would be to indentured servitude i don t really want to get into a discussion on slavery anyway although it does demonstrate your point i don t think it is relevent because the original poster did not say that absence of specific condemenation proves something is not immoral back to the original poster s assertion he is not in fact making the logical error of which you accuse him he stated the fact that the bible does not say that babies cannot be baptized also we know that the bible says that everyone must be baptized to enter heaven everyone includes infants unless there is other scripture to the contrary i e an exception since there is no exception listed in the bible we must assume to be on the safe side that the bible means what it says that everyone must be baptized to enter heaven and so we baptize infants to summarize you accused the original poster of saying if something is not forbidden by the bible then that proves it is ok i e if something cannot be disproven it is true he rather seemed to be asserting that since the bible does not forbid you cannot prove using the bible that it is not ok there is a difference between proving whether or not something can be proven or disproven there are theories on provability in the field of logic by the way and actually proving or disproving it the other logical error we must avoid falling into is the converse that if something cannot be proven then it is false this seems to be the error of many sola scriptura believers i think the only thing that can be proven here is that one cannot use scripture alone to prove something either way about infant baptism although the evidence seems to me to favor it steve creps indiana university creps lateran ucs indiana edu

re faq essay on homosexuality before you finalize your file in the faqs or after you might want to correct the typo in the following kinsey see below is the source of the figure percent he defines sexuality by behavior not by orientation and ranked all persons on a scale from zero completely heterosexual to completely heterosexual it seems one or the other end of the rating scale should be identified with homosexual as a personal note i guess i differ with you on the question of work entering human life as a result of sin note that in the creation story work enters human life as a result of sin before the fall gen and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it which i would call work for me the difference introduced by sin is the painful aspects of work added at the fall i take the cursing of the ground in vs to apply to the work for sustenance in a way some view work as a blessing ecclesiastes is a fun book for melancholies i hope i do not sound caustic maybe you can enlighten me further well this is certainly a delicate subject and i guess you accomplished what you state as your purpose it summarizes arguments for allowing christian homosexuality not for me the most noble goal but you are writing a faq i wonder if you might temporize the apparent sentence of the specific homosexual you propose arguably tenuously define the danger in advising christians to depend upon such a change is clear when conversion doesn t happen which is almost always the people are often left in despair feeling excluded from a church that has nothing more to say but a requirement of life long celibacy perhaps that would be true of celibacy from homosexual relations or refrainng from their choice relationships but that does not forbid heterosexual could they not have enjoy heterosexual relations for what it was worth this depends upon the person in some cases i think the answer is no even with those who could consider what you re asking i assume we re talking about marriage i certainly would not want to suggest sex outside that you re talking about a permanent commitment to a kind of sexual relationship that they aren t really sure they can live with there may be people for whom this is a possible solution but i wonder whether it s entirely fair to the other partner i have a cousin who was a victim of exactly this situation we found out later after her death that her husband had had problems with his sexual identity his family conservative christians knew it and pushed him into getting married he continued having problems and they were near divorce she died in an accident whose circumstances some of the relatives consider odd he has since had a sex change operation and has been moving around from state to state without being able to hold a job keeping their children in a kind of home life both sets of grandparents consider irresponsible i hope you can understand why i am not enthusiastic about pushing homosexuals into marriage i really liked my cousin this is sort of an emotional issue for me again it may be possible for some but this is the sort of situation that needs to be dealt with pastorally and not as a matter of fixed ideology clh

an quoted argument for theism on sun may damon wrote a christian friend of mine once reasoned that if we were never created we could not exists therefore we were created and therefore there exists a creator i hesitate to comment on the validity of this because i do not know what your friend meant by it if he meant that whatever exists must have been created then he is open to the obvious retort that god exists and so god must have been created perhaps your friend meant that we exist now but that there was a time when we did not exist and therefore something other than ourselves must have brought us into existence this seems plausible but an atheist might reply so my parents engendered me so what here your friend would have to explain why an infinite regress of causes is not a satisfactory explanation he would have some support from philosophers who are not ordinarily considered religious ayn rand and some others who are in the tradition of aristotle having argued for a first cause he would have to bridge the gap between said entity and the god of abraham if he merely asserts that the things we observe are ultimately dependent on things radically unlike them few physicists would disagree yours james kiefer

re homosexuality issues in christiani ofm writes this is an issue throughout the presbyterian church on the other side one of the major churches in cincinnati has been ordaining homosexual elders and has ignored presbytery instructions not to do so and the church in rochester where the judicial commission said they couldn t install a homosexual pastor has made her an evangelist these situations as well as the one you describe do not appear to be stable this will certainly be a major topic for the general assembly next month if the church can t come up with a solution that will let people live with each other i think we re end up with a split clearly neither side wants that but i think we ll get pushed into it by actions of both sides clh the moderator of the general assembly the rev john fife visited our church about a week ago just days after rev spahr it s been a busy week for our small church he was asked specifically about the issue of homosexuality and what he thinks will happen at the ga meeting next month evidently there are known resolutions pending that range the gamut from outlawing homosexuality altogether to legalizing it completely he will readily admit that this is probabaly the most difficult issue that the church has had to deal with since the presbyterian church split in two over the issue of slavery more than years ago without question the issue may split the church again after we ve been reunited for all of a dozen years or so he is hopeful that it will not and is pushing the same attitude that helped the church deal with the abortion issue last year as a solution he is hoping to pass a resolution that more or less states that we the members of the church agree to disagree on the issue admitting that both sides have honestly studied the scriptures and had the spirit lead them to different conclusions it worked last year when the abortion issue threatened to do more or less the same thing and he is hopeful that the ga can foster a loving and caring attitude about people who disagree with their own view cliff slaughterbeck dept of physics fm it s time for the sermon on the university of washington grand torino seattle wa it s going to be hard to agree to disagree if we allow disagreement then some presbyteries and churches are going to ordain people that others will not recognize that s a difficult situation in a connectional church i could live with it but i think a lot of people would not be willing to note that the church was not willing to live with this kind of compromise with ordination of women the one thing that will definitely prevent a person from becoming a presbyterian minister is if they indicate that they don t accept ordination of women the argument is that we can t have half the church not accepting the leaders of the other half maybe people will decide to live with it in this case when they didn t in the other but i wonder i admit that my own presbytery submitted an overture to the ga that would have exactly this effect and we considered the ambiguity better than the current situation clh
re homosexual issues in christianity whitsebd nextwork rose hulman edu bryan whitsell sent in a list of verses which he felt condemn homosexuality mls panix com michael siemon wrote in response that some of these verses are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations and that others simply do not address the issues in response i wrote i can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues however a couple of them seem as though they do not require incredibly perverse interpretations in order to be seen as condemning homosexuality do not be deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate nor homosexuals nor thieves nor the covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor swindlers shall inherit the kingdom of god and such were some of you i cor would someone care to comment on the fact that the above seems to say fornicators will not inherit the kingdom of god how does this apply to homosexuals i understand fornication to be sex outside of marriage is this an accurate definition is there any such thing as same sex marriage in the bible my understanding has always been that the new testament blesses sexual intercourse only between a husband and his wife i am however willing to listen to scriptural evidence to the contrary remainder of my post deleted the moderator then made some comments i would like to address there s some ambiguity about the meaning of the words in the passage you quote both liberal and conservative sources seem to agree that homosexual is not the general term for homosexuals but is likely to have a meaning like homosexual prostitute that doesn t meant that i think all the biblical evidence vanishes but the nature of the evidence is such that you can t just quote one verse and solve things if you are referring to the terms effeminate and homosexuals in the above passage i agree that the accuracy of the translation has been challenged however i was simply commenting on the charge that it is an incredibly perverse interpretation to read this as a condemnation of homosexuality such a charge seems to imply that no reasonable person would ever conclude from the verse that paul intended to condemn homosexuality however i think i can see how a reasonable person might very well take this view of the verse therefore i do not believe it is incredibly perverse to read it in this way i think your argument from fornication is circular why is homosexuality wrong because it s fornication why is it fornication because they re not married why aren t they married because the church refuses to do a marriage ceremony why does the church refuse to do a marriage ceremony because homosexuality is wrong in order to break the circle there s got to be some other reason to think homosexuality is wrong clh actually i wasn t thinking of the church at all after all a couple doesn t have to be married by a minister a secular justice of the peace could do the job and the two people would be married my point was that it is easy to find a biblical basis for heterosexual marriage but where in the bible would one get a christian marriage between two people of the same sex and if you do see a biblical basis for same sex marriages how willing would gay christians be to save themselves for such a marriage and to never have sexual intercourse with anyone outside of that marriage relationship please note that i am not trying to imply that gay christians would not be willing to be so monogamous i am genuinely interested in hearing opinions on the subject i have heard comments from gays in the past that lead me to believe they regard promiscuity as one of the main points of being homosexual yet i tend to doubt that gays who want to be christian would advocate such a position so what is the gay view mark yes i agree that a reasonable person might conclude that paul is condemning homosexuality i was responding to certain details of your posting that doesn t mean i agree with michael in all respects clh

them prayers such as break the arm of the wicked and evil men call him to account for his wickedness psalm did not seem consistent with the gospel of love which i had accepted yet psalm was clearly motivated by love for god the lord is king for ever and ever the nation will perish from his land and why does the wicked man revile god and by love for the innocent who suffer you hear o lord the desire of the afflicted you encourage them and you listen to their cry defending the fatherless and oppressed in order that man who is of the earth may terrify no more nevertheless i grew increasingly uncomfortable reading such graphic prayers for god to judge the wicked as pour out your wrath on them let your fierce anger overtake them o lord the god avenges o god who avenges shine forth rise up o judge of the earth pay back to the proud what they deserve break the teeth in their mouths o god let them vanish like water let their arrows be blunted the righteous will be glad when they are avenged when they bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked then men will way surely the righteous still are rewarded surely there is a god who judges the earth certainly i wanted god to be honoured and yes i was deeply destressed by the prevalence of evil but could i actually pray for god to pour out his wrath on the wicked the scripture make it clear that these prayers are not to be prayed for own selfish motives nor against our personal enemies rather they are to be prayed in christ for his glory and against his enemies the psalmist describes the targets of these imprecation as those who devise injustice in their heart and whose hands mete out violence those who boast of evil and are a disgrace in the eyes of god your tongue plots destruction it is like a sharpened razor and you who practise deceit you love evil rather than good falsehood rather than speaking the truth they crush your people they slay the widow and the alien they murder the fatherless with cunning they conspire against your people they plot against those you cherish you hate all who do wrong you destroy those who tell lies bloodthirsty and deceitful men the lord abhors to those unrepentant enemies of god the psalmist declares surely god will bring you down to everlasting ruin surely god will crush the heads of his enemies of those who go on in their sins and the purpose of these prayers for justice is declared then it will be known to the ends of the earth that god rules to proclaim the powers of god all kings will bow down to him and all nations will serve him who knows the power of your anger for your wrath is as great as the fear that is due you yet despite the fact that of the psalms include imprecations prayers invoking god s righteous judgement upon the wicked such prayers are rare in the average western church however amongst the persecuted churches these prayers are much more common praying against the persecutors amidst the burnt out churches and devastation of marxist angola i found the survivors of communist persecution including the crippled and maimed and widows and orphans praying for god to strike down the wicked and remove the persecutors of the church i was shocked yet it was biblical even the martyrs in heaven pray how long sovereign lord holy and true until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood revelation the initiator of the communist persecution in angola was agestino neto described as a drunken psychotic marxist poet neto had been installed by cuban troops as the first dictator of angola he boasted that within years there won t be a bible or a church left in angola i will have eradicated christianity yet despite the vicious wave of church burning and massacres it is not christianity that was eradicated in angola but agestino neto neto died in mysterious circumstances on an operating table in moscow in romania i learnt of a series of remarkable incidents recorded of god judging the persecutors of the church in answer to prayer a communist official ordered a certain pastor to be arrested the next day the official died of a heart attack another communist party official ordered that all the bibles in his district were to be collected and pulped to be turned into toilet paper this blasphemous project was in fact carried out but the next day when the official was medically examined he was informed that he had terminal cancer he died shortly afterwards on another occasion a communist official who had ordered a baptist church to be demolished by bulldozers died in a car crash the very next day when an order was given to dismantle a place of worship on the mountainside in a forest the workmen flatly refused to carry out the order at gunpoint a group of conscripted gypsies also refused to touch the church in desperation the communist police forced prisoners at bayonet point to dismantle the structure yet the officer in charge pleaded with the local christians to pray for him that god would not judge him he emphasised that he had nothing against christians and was only obeying strict orders the building was in fact reconstructed later and again used for worship they were all seized with sear and the name of the lord jesus was held in high honour in this way the word of the lord spread widely and grew in power acts nicolae ceaucescu the dictator who ordered much of the persecution in romania was overthrown by his own army and executed on christmas day to joyous shouts of the antichrist is dead in the streets many testified that this was in answer to the fervent prayers of the long suffering people of romania another persecutor of the church who challenged god was samora machel the first dictator of marxist mozambique samora machel was a cannibal who ate human flesh in witchcraft ceremonies in the s he pledged his soul to satan and vowed that he would destroy the church and turn mozambique into the first truly marxist leninist state in africa thousands of churches in mozambique were closed confiscated nationalised chained and padlocked burnt down or boarded up missionaries were expelled some being imprisoned first evangelism was forbidden bibles were ceremonially burnt and tens of thousands of christians including many pastors and elders were shipped off to concentration camps most were never seen again a month before his sudden death samora machel cursed god publicly and challenged him to prove his existence by striking him machel dead on october while several churches were specifically praying for god to stop the persecution in mozambique machel s soviet tupelov aircraft crashed in a violent thunderstorm the plane crashed metres within south africa s boundary with mozambique amidst the wreckage the marxist plans for overthrowing the government of malawi were discovered and published not only had god judged a blasphemer and a persecutor but he had also saved a country from persecution in the months leading up to the first multi party elections in zambia many churches fasted and prayed tor god to remove the year socialist dictatorship of kenneth kaunda this was done on st october when fredrick chiluba a man converted to christ whilst imprisoned for opposing kaunda was elected president of zambia and covenanted to make zambia a christian country it is recorded in history that the wicked mary queen of scots declared trembling and in tears i am more afraid of john knox s prayers than of an army of ten thousand on april the secretary general of the south african communist party chris hani was shot dead from the unprecedented international wave of condolences and adulation reported one could be forgiven for assuming that this man was a saint and a martyr certainly it was not the death and resurrection of christ jesus which dominated the thoughts and headlines of south africa this easter but the assassination of chris hani the stunning hypocrisy of the situation is that people were murdered in south africa in yet more collective concern and anguish were reported over the death of the head of the sa communist party than for all the thousands of other victims indeed the sa government the international community and the mass media have apparently had greater sorrow reported over this one death than for all the south africans murdered since nd february when the anc sacp and pac were unbanned yet as a member of the anc revolutionary council since deputy commander of umkhonto we sizwe mk the anc s military wing from and chief of staff of mk from chris hani had approved and ordered bombings and assassinations of many unarmed civilians as jesus warned all who live by the sword will die by the sword matt after personally confronting hani about his terrorist activities at a press conference in washington dc where he publicly declared his support for fidel castro col gaddafi yasser arafat and saddam hussein and defended the placing of car bombs and limpet mines in public places during the struggle i told him that i was a christian and while i didn t hate him i did hate communism and i was praying for him that god would either bring him to repentance and salvation in christ or that god would remove him he responded by swearing and declaring that he was an atheist several other people also prayed that god would either bring hani to repentance or remove him similarly several churches in america have begun to pray the imprecatory psalms against unrepentant abortionists in one town abortionists were struck down with heart attacks strokes car accidents and cancer within months of these public prayers for god to stop these killers of preborn babies some praised god for his righteous acts of judgement and quoted when justice is done it brings joy to the righteous and terror to evildoers proverbs others were shocked that any christian could express satisfaction at the misfortune of any even of the blatantly wicked yet the apostles prayed imprecatory prayers acts galatians tim and so did our lord matt what then should our attitude towards the imprecatory psalms be should we be praying the psalms to tackle these thorny issues i would like to present a short summary of an excellent book war psalms of the prince of peace lessons from the imprecatory psalms by james e adams published by the presbyterian and reformed publishing company our lord jesus christ his apostles used the psalms constantly in teaching men to know god the new testament nt quotes the old testament ot over times of all ot quotes in the nt are from the psalms christ himself alluded to the psalms over times the psalms are the prayer book of the bible are the imprecatory psalms the oracles of god some christian commentators theologians reject these psalms as devilish diabolical unsuited to the church and not god s pronouncements of his wrath on the wicked but the prayers of a man for vengeance on his enemies just the opposite of jesus teaching that we should love our enemies yet tim declares all scripture is god breathed and is useful for teaching rebuking correcting and training in righteousness so that the man of god may be thoroughly equipped for every good work see also peter the fact that something in the word of god is beyond our comprehension is not grounds to denying or even questioning its inspiration to make ourselves the judge of what is good or evil is to impudently take the place of god do we imagine ourselves to be holier than god wrong ideas of god have led many to become evangelic plastic surgeons who have made it their job to clean up god s word according to their own ideas of what is proper they have forgotten that it is god alone who must determine what christianity is and what is suitable for his church the essence of what many have done is to question the authority of god s word like eve s original sin of listening to satan s question yes hath god said the psalms are part of god s revelation of himself and his attributes and they are reaffirmed by the nt as the authoritative word of god those imprecatory psalms which these evangelical plastic surgeons reject as unsuited and unworthy for the church are the very psalms christ used to testify about himself eg mark matt and which the apostles used as authoritative scripture eg acts acts heb see also samuel ch spurgeon said concerning the imprecatory psalms especially ps truly this is one of the hard places of scripture a passage which the soul trembles to read yet it is not ours to sit in judgement upon it but to bow our ear to what the lord would speak to us therein the rejection of any part of god s word is a rejection of the giver of that word god himself who is praying these psalms christ quoted the psalms not merely as prophesy he actually spoke the psalms as his own words the psalms occupied an enormous place in the life of our lord he used it as his prayer book and song book from the synagogue to the festivals and at the last supper on the cross christ quoted from the psalms not as some ancient authority that he adapted for his own use but as his very own words the words of the lord s anointed which as david s son he truly was father into your hands i commit my spirit ps my god my god why have you forsaken me ps in his ministry christ foretells what he will say as the judge on the day of judgement and he quotes the psalms in doing so matt then i will tell them plainly i never knew you away from me you evildoers ps in heb the apostle attributes ps directly to christ although nowhere in the gospels is christ recorded as having said these words similarly hebrews attributes ps directly to christ despite there being no record of his having spoken these words while on earth clearly the apostles believed christ is speaking in the psalms christ came to establish his kingdom and to extend his mercy in all the earth but let us never forget that jesus will come again to execute judgement on the wicked david as the anointed king of the chosen people of god was a prototype of jesus christ acts being therefore a prophet he foresaw and spoke of the resurrection of christ david was a witness to christ in his office in his lite and in his words the same words which david spoke the future messiah spoke through him the prayers of david were prayed also by christ or better christ himself prayed these psalms through his forerunner david the imprecatory psalms are expressions of the infinite justice of god of his indignation against wrong doing and his compassion for the wronged but what about the psalms of repentance christ is also the lamb of god the substitutionary sacrifice for our sins christ in the day of his crucifixion was charged with the sin of his people he appropriated to himself those debts for which he had made himself responsible our lord was the substitution for the sinner he took the sinners place isaiah god made him who had no sin to be sin for us so that in him we might become the righteousness of god cor in history the psalms especially the imprecatory psalms have been understood to have been the prayers of christ by st augustine jerome ambrose tertullian luther and many others all the psalms are the voice of christ christ is praying the imprecatory psalms all the psalms are messianic it is the lord jesus christ who is praying these prayers of vengeance it is only right for the righteous king of peace to ask god to destroy his enemies these prayers signal an alarm to all who are still enemies of king jesus his prayers will be answered god s word is revealed upon all who oppose christ anyone who rejects god s way of forgiveness in the cross of christ will bear the dreadful curses of god he who prays psalm will one day make this prayer a reality when he declares to those on his left depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels matt all the enemies of the lord need to hear these psalms god s kingdom is at war the powers of evil will tall and god alone will reign forever with justice he judges and makes war out of his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations he will rule them with an iron sceptre he treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of god almighty king of kings and lord of lords rev are jesus prayers contradictory what about jesus command to love our enemies and to bless those who curse us matt christ is of course the loving and merciful saviour who forgives sin but he is also the awesome judge who is coming in judgement on those who disobey his gospel god is just he will pay back trouble to those who trouble you and give relief to you who are troubled this will happen when the lord jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels he will punish those who do not obey the gospel of our lord jesus they will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the lord and from the majesty of his power on the day he comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marvelled at among au those who have believed thess jesus has power on earth to forgive sins and he has power on earth to execute judgement upon his enemies in the psalms we see both the vengeance and the love ot god even in the n t in the gospels we see imprecations woe to you hypocrites blind guides blind fools full of greed and self indulgence whitewashed tombs you snakes you brood of vipers how will you escape being condemned to hell matt in matt christ quotes from ps and to refer to his betrayal by judas we also need to acknowledge that christ s prayers of blessing are not for all in john it is clear that christ is only praying to the elect of god those who have obeyed your word accepted god s word and have believed see luke those who reject the message of god s kingdom will be judged may we pray the imprecatory psalms martin luther pointed out that when one prays hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done then he must put all the opposition to this in one pile and say curses maledictions and disgrace upon every other name and every other kingdom may they be ruined and torn apart and may all their schemes and wisdom and plans run aground to pray tor the extension of god s kingdom is to solicit the destruction of all other kingdoms eg dan the god of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed it will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end but it will itself endure forever advance and victory for the church means defeat and retreat for the kingdom of darkness there is a life death struggle between two kingdoms the church cannot exclude hatred tor satan s kingdom from its love for god s kingdom god s kingdom cannot come without satan s kingdom being destroyed god s will cannot be done on earth without the destruction of evil the glory of god demands the destruction of evil instead of being influenced by a sickly sentimentalism which insists upon the assumed but really non existent rights of man we should focus instead upon the rights of god note psalm where the psalmist prays against those who plot together against god and his people cover their faces with shame so that men will seek your name o lord do to them as you did to midian as you did to sisera and jabin at the river kishon who perished at endor and became like refuse on the ground the story of sisera in the book of judges chapter and provides a vivid example of god s judgement on the wicked sisera cruelly oppressed the israelites for twenty years and they cried to the lord for help judges in response to those prayers the lord routed sisera and all his chariots and army by the sword and sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot all the troops of sisera fell by the sword not a man was left judges the account then goes on to describe how sisera escaped to the tent of jael where she lulled him into a false sense of safety and then drove a tent peg through his temple with a hammer the song of victory by deborah and barak celebrated the crushing of the head of sisera in graphic detail judges and it is this that psalm implores god to again do to his enemies as you did to sisera the blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience the imprecatory psalms are fully consistent with the law of god if you do not carefully follow all the words of this law which are written in this book and do not revere this glorious and awesome name the lord your god the lord will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants he will bring upon you all the diseases of egypt that you dreaded and they will cling to you the lord will also bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not recorded in this book of the law until you are destroyed because you did not obey the lord your god so it will please him to ruin and destroy you you will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess deuteronomy the covenant god made with his people included curses for disobedience as well as blessings for obedience deuteronomy records the formal giving and receiving of the covenant terms in an awesome account the levites shall recite to all the people of israel in a loud voice cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol a thing detestable to the lord the work of the craftsman s hands and sets it up in secret then all the people shall say amen cursed is the man who dishonours his father or his mother cursed is the man who moves his neighbour s boundary stone cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the roads cursed is the man who withholds justice from the alien the fatherless or the widow cursed is the man who kills his neighbour secretly cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of the law by carrying them out then all the people shall say amen deut the new testament confirms that the inevitable consequence of rejecting christ is the curse if anyone does not love the lord a curse be on him corinthians see also romans hebrews how can we preach these prayers the church of jesus christ is an army under orders scripture constitutes the official dispatch from the commander in chief but we have a problem those who are called to pass on those orders to others are refusing to do so how then can we expect to be a united effective army is it any wonder that the troops have lost sight of their commission to demolish the strongholds of the kingdom of darkness if the church does not hear the battle cries of her captain how will she follow him onto the battlefield pastors are commissioned to pass on the orders of the church s commander never withholding or changing his words one whose job is to carry dispatches to troops in wartime would face certain and severe punishment if he dared to amend the general s orders the pastor s charge is of greater importance than that of a courier in any earthly army there s no place tor the dispatcher to decide he doesn t agree with his commander s strategy when jesus christ sent seventy two disciples on a preaching mission he told them to proclaim the coming of god s kingdom lk that is to announce that people must submit to god s rule in their lives jesus instructed them to pray for peace on any house they approach assuring them that if anyone rejected it the peace would return on the disciples verse but we must consider what he said they should do if their message were rejected that is if the hearers persisted in rebellion against god s rule but when you enter a town and are not welcomed go into its streets and say even the dust of your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you yet be sure of this the kingdom of god is near luke what would be the result of that denunciation i tell you it will be more bearable on that day for sodom on which god sent fire from heaven in judgement for its wickedness than for that town verse immediately jesus added curses on korazin bethsaida and capernaum tor their rejection of his message verses he then explained to the disciples the great authority he had given them he who listens to you listens to me he who rejects you rejects me but he who rejects me rejects him who sent me verse this is the fundamental basis tor calling down god s curses on anyone his persistent rebellion against god s authority expressed in his law and the ministry of his servants we need to clearly and forcefully proclaim the war cries of the prince of peace only then will the church awake from its lethargy and once again enter the battle if we tail to pass on the battle cry then a lack of urgency and confusion in the ranks will be inevitable like psalm our preaching needs to clearly show the blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience the eternal truth is that god cannot be mocked whatever a man sows that shall he reap galatians the curses pronounced on disobedience in deut were fulfilled in detail in samaria kings and in judea ad the wrath of god upon covenant breakers is real the i of the psalms is jesus christ the we of the psalms includes those of us in the lord jesus the enemies are not our own individually but those of the lord and of his church the psalms are ot christ as prophet priest and king they record christ s march in victory against the kingdom of darkness as christ is the author of the psalms so too is he the final fulfilment of the covenant on which they are based god will answer the psalmist s prayers completely in jesus christ on the final day of judgment while on earth jesus foretold the day when he will say but those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them bring them here and kill them in front of me luke a fatal end awaits everyone who refuses to acknowledge and to obey jesus as king and lord hearing expositions of these war psalms of the prince of peace will remind his people that god s kingdom is at war the kingdom of darkness is being overcome by the kingdom of jesus christ a war in which each local congregation of believers plays a vital part you must rally your battalion to put on the whole armour of god including the sword of the spirit which is the word of god eph that battle readiness also involves pray ing in the spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests n eph christ teaches his army to pray for the utter destruction of the enemies of god as the psalmist did pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you on the kingdoms that do not call on your name ps to deal with the very real hurts and injustices in this world it is necessary for us to pray for god s justice those who are persecuted need the comfort of these prayers let the saints rejoice in his honour and sing for joy may the praise of god be in their mouths and a double edged sword in their hands to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples to bind their kings with fetters their nobles with shackles of iron to carry out the sentences written against them this is the glory of all his saints praise the lord ps prayer is in fact spiritual warfare one weapon is prayer for conversion of spiritual enemies another is prayer for judgement on those who finally refuse to be converted we handicap the army of god when we refuse to use both of these great weapons that he has given us it is at all times a part of the task of the people nf god to destroy evil if you have been guilty of dulling your sword by neglecting or undermining these psalms repent of that sin sharpen your sword anew and go forth to do battle in the name and for the glory of jesus until the knowledge of the lord will cover the earth as the waters cover the sea hab the full book war psalms of the prince of peace is

re deuterocanonicals esp sirach what we call today the old testament was being written up to approx imately bce according to most modern scholars aside from the book of daniel the whole ot predates alexander the great these books were written predominantly in hebrew there were also other books being written at about this time and later by greek speaking or hellenistic jews these books are those which are reckoned by many denominations as apocrypha before the closing of the writings the third part of what is today called the canon all of the books were in use by jews of the day however there were those who reckoned based on zech that prophecy had ceased this faction maintained that there were no true prophets in their day they also maintained that literature of a prophetic character could not be genuine teachings from god by the time of c ce another faction had entered the mess christians had come in claiming that their writings were also suitable to be read in synagogues and used for worship therefore the palestinian jewish leaders got together and stated that the books written from the time of ben sira sirach onward were not sacred writings they justified this from zech in particular they said the writings of the christians called heretics were not inspired at about ce they codified things further by closing the canon in somewhat of an official sense at the council of jamnia a few books ecclesi astes song of songs esther made it in after that date but these were those which had been written prior to the official cut off point the time of ben sira for inclusion that they had established in order to keep out the christian and hellenistic writings jerome excluded the apocrypha because they were not in use by jews of his day and because they were except for sirach not found in hebrew in his time his criterion for separating them from the other pre christian writings was not based on inspiration there is plenty more to say but i do not have time the passage you quote concerns the book rev in which it is found frank d
boston c of c note the following article is submitted on behalf of someone frank daniels who has difficulty posting to s r c email replies to daniels math ufl edu i am unable to post to the bitnet groups here is a capsule history of the shepherding discipleship movement in the churches of christ i e crossroads boston i could trace the movement back as far as and indeed some of its roots go back that far but these were really influences on the movement and not the actual movement per se i will start in c in that day there were white churches and colored churches in nearly every area due to segregation modern pentecostalism was developing as a predominantly colored phenomenon here there was great fanaticism emphasis on emotional experiences and belief in a personal guidance and indwelling of the holy spirit many white protestant churches were growing into what became known as conservative fundamentalism by the s the evangelical movement was in full swing and many groups were becoming part of it when the civil rights movement grew stronger in the s and s many white church groups began to be influenced by the black churches and by what was going on there this spread started in the most liberal of groups and spread to the more conservative ones by the late s in even the catholic church was displaying evidence of influence by the other groups still evident today the churches of christ are and were a very conservative protestant group when the influence from outside began to reach the cofc in c it was generally not appreciated conservative groups are very strongly resistant to change and the new movement was very different from the cofc status quo the magazines put out at that time by cofc folks tell the story as it unfolds new ideas came into the cofc there was a big push to reach out to college students young adults and teens some called this the campus evangel ism movement emotions generally not highly regarded in the cofc at large played a more important role in the new movement in some places people began to speak in tongues as their pentecostal predecessors did this was met with extreme criticism from within the churches of christ in some places people were fired from their jobs for speaking in tongues or for advocating the holy spirit movement another name for the new branch the term underground church of christ also came into use because these people had to hide their differences or they might be ostricised there were several congregations however whose leaderships were receptive to the new ideas at least in part the tongues speaking never really caught on one of these was the th street church of christ in gainesville fl campus ministry had already been regarded as important at th street and the new ideas seemed to be very helpful tools for evangelism they also seemed to put vitality into the church which many felt had been lacking in october of the th street congregation hired chuck lucas to be its campus minister by he would move to being the congregation s lead minister in the late s early s the congregation worked with many other groups they held bible discussions at daytona beach during spring break they organized talks in the fraternities on the university of florida campus they also worked with uf sports people in the congregation ordered a larger building to be constructed when it was finished the group moved and changed its name now no longer appropriate it became the crossroads church of christ from then on a name that would become legendary by this time crossroads was basically the only cofc whose programs were fully aligned to the new movement while they didn t start it they continued it and were responsible for where it wound up going by none of the other churches of christ in the area felt that they could cooperate with crossroads due to what they recognized as doctrinal problems at crossroads crossroads had begun to heavily emphasize and later require attendance at all church functions it was seen as a good thing for each member to have at least one close relationship a person with whom you would share all of your problems pray and get help from the concept was called prayer partners which later became discipleship partners and also later became mandatory the leadership was assigning prayer partners to people for a while the book called the master plan of evangelism was a strong influence on chuck lucas he and the group believed that it was every person s duty and life purpose to carry out the great commission crossroads was growing in number and numbers became very important some would say all important a person who was evangelistic was spiritual evangelism meant inviting people to crossroads events if you did this a lot and some of them converted then you were spiritual there were sermons about how if you bought groceries the cashier and bag boy ought to receive invitations to services everyone at your job ought to receive invitations since these people needed jesus you should be aggressive don t take no for an answer if you did not evangelize enough you came to be called lazy or unspiritual by the end of the decade the prayer partner system was integrated into a structure the elders and ministers were on top like a big pyramid then the group leaders bible study leaders and members everyone who came in had someone placed over them it is at this time that the bad press about crossroads began to circulate the problem with rape on the university of florida campus was tremendous but crossroads was considered a bigger and more immediate problem there were many complaints about the congregation and its pushy evangelistic tactics crossroads was considering the other churches of christ to be dead churches which aggravated them it was aggressively recruiting out of the other church groups denominations which aggravated them by this time crossroads had grown numerically to the point where not only did they believe that they would soon need a new building but also they were sending out planting create a new church and reconstructing reorganize an existing church teams to other cities by this time the crossroads movement was underway a group was sent to the member lexington church of christ in boston ma the team was headed up by kip mckean who had been converted out of a fraternity by crossroads in gainesville kip held a still stronger view of church authority which he believed was heavily vested in the evangelist s and not so much in the elders he had been fired in from the congregation that he had been working at when the elders there found numerous things wrong with his theology including the practice of what came to be called one over one christianity called this by critics in the first year half of the people felt that they did not want to be a part of the new congregation they left but others began coming into the new boston church of christ ah but i m ahead of myself at crossroads the heavy handed system had begun to take its toll on the members many have said that they felt that they were working hard but they were not achieving the results that were so important the numbers were dropping from crossroads membership declined steadily the leadership began to tighten the reigns on the congregation who was seen as being largely unproductive and unfruitful the fruit passages in the nt were interpreted as referring to new converts if you were not bearing fruit said john you would be cast into the fire boston still teaches this if you love your neighbor you ll save his soul invite him to church and convert him if you re not doing that you don t love your neighbor and if you don t love you re in danger of backsliding the logical arguments continue in this vein in chuck lucas was fired from his job as minister due to recurring sins in his life these struggles were never revealed to the congregation at large although many people outside the congregation had heard about them for by now there was very little contact on a friendship level between most crossroads members and those outside if you have contact your focus should be on converting them bring them to a bible study chuck s replacement was joe woods who was fully supportive of the boston system as boston grew in number they began to offer training sessions for other ministers joe went to boston to be trained and returned to cross roads ready to emphasize the total commitment to the church that boston and kip mckean were now emphasizing eventually in fall of the elders at crossroads now in number dick whitehead and bill hogle made a decision boston was demanding that all of the other churches in the movement come under the direction of the church in boston the elders refused citing their belief that each church should be autonomous something true in all non boston churches of christ perhaps there was also some degree of offense done here since crossroads was no longer the example to the rest of the movement the group now numbered about while boston was now larger in membership the churches of christ generally teach that baptism is a necessary element of salvation at crossroads they taught what was called lordship baptism you had to understand the commitment involved before you could be baptized you had to count the cost at boston they took this a step further if at some time you became unproductive then your spirituality was suspect people would begin to ask you if you really understood what you were getting into anyone who said no had their baptism deemed invalid they hadn t counted the cost properly they still had to be baptized others called this rebaptism and crossroads didn t approve of this practice when crossroads announced that it would not follow boston many of its members left crossroads and went to movement related ministries which were now called discipling ministries you were either discipling evangelizing or you were dead they also used the nickname movement of god for a while by summer of crossroads was withdrawn from the movement and now stood alone they had few to no allies in the mainstream churches of christ and now none in the movement boston however continued to chart its course in the direction that they had been following they sent reconstruction teams to many cities which usually meant that they split the church there they stopped acknowledging other churches of christ as christians and began to call themselves the remnant the remnant of the jews in the ot are those who are saved by god it was felt that the remnant today represents all the christians sometimes they would simply call their movement the church they usually took the name of the city for their name implying to the other churches of christ that boston did not recognize their existence many campuses have now formally forbidden boston ministries from recruiting there due to the number of complaints in some cases it has been documented that boston ministries have lied to university officials in order to continue to have access to the campus any resistance that they experience is termed perse cution which all true christians are expected to experience are you really a christian if you re not being persecuted the numbers at boston peaked at c in since then they have fought to remain steady i have heard a tape of kip mckean shouting at the leaders for failing to fulfill the great commission their life s purpose as god commanded them their christianity is highly centered on commands and obedience crossroads once was called a cult boston is now recognized by the cult awareness network and other national and international groups as a cult under a formal definition because of the techniques which they employ the term cult is usually differentiated from sect by the practice of those techniques the techniques which they employ are recognized by many as being techniques of destructive pursuasion also used by other shepherding discipleship groups robert jay lifton margaret thaler singer and many others have written about the topic these techniques include guilt motivation emotional manipulation loaded language the aura of sacred science a sort of mystic element seen in everyday events and others i have no particular axe to grind against the movement i have numer ous friends who are still part of the movement i have never had a falling out with anyone in the movement i disagree with many things which they teach i recognize the psychological damage done by being involved in such a system i hold no loyalty to the mainstream churches of christ and do not defend their mistakes either i want to point out though that unlike in many other systems which are in other ways similar the leadership of the boston movement are as much victims of the system as the members we do not have a leader who enjoys manipulating his people the leaders believe what they teach and they feel accountable for the activites and spiritual welfare of the members when members do not evangelize to their expectations for example the leaders feel personally responsible as well the leaders are not out for money or power they want to evangelize the world in their lifetime i have said too much but there is much more to say there are many examples i could give and quotes from other sources including boston bulletins that i could include but this is too long already you may post this if you so desire frank d answer not a fool according to his folly lest thou also be like unto him answer a fool according

re if there were no hell larry l overacker writes q if you knew beyond all doubt that hell did not exist and that unbelievers simply remained dead would you remain a christian my contention is that if you answer this question with no i would not then remain a christian then you really are not one now i follow christ because it s a great way to live life and i could care less what really happens after i die i believe that there will be a resurrection but that won t have any effect on how i live this life ouch this is a good question to me not existing is worse than existing no matter what so i will modify this question to be would i be a christian if it made no eternal difference in my reward or punishment i hope this is in the same spirit you want i personally am very goal oriented it is hard for me to do things that do not achieve some goal however to relate this to sports only after i learned to not care about the score did i become a good basketball player i had to learn to go all out no matter the situation perhaps this lesson is relevent after all only if i can give up my life can i keep it only if i am humble can i achieve glory only if i concentrate on living my life now the best i can will i be afforded life eternal i think you have illuminated the true meaning of saved by faith but what is my answer right now i would remain a christian however was that always my answer that s the problem heaven and hell are good motivators at certain stages of maturity and i admit there are certain times when perhaps i bite my tongue and put up with something in the hope of a better day i e i mentally trade present happiness for future happiness i hope the cynics and skeptics do not read more into that than appropriate but i am trying to be honest scott a mayo writes of course but it is a pointless question because you cannot know beyond all doubt that hell does not exist anymore than you can know it does short of taking jesus s word for it what if questions are fun and entertaining but probably fruitless i think these kinds of questions are extremely fruitful i guess it depends on how one views knowledge and learning by stripping ideas to simple straightforward opposing concepts we can determine levels of importance by analyzing the theoretically absurd we can gain a better understanding of the actually absurd chris mussack

re homosexuality issues in christianity any attempts to make homosexuals feel unwelcome because of our discomfort with homosexuality is incompatible with christianity is our hatred so deep that rather than see someone try to become closer to jesus we need to keep them away this is too often true many people try to place this as a higher sin however does jesus need us to screen out those guilty of a particular sin do we really mistrust jesus when he says he can forgive any sin a big part of the problem is that many of the homosexuals and people advocating acceptance of homosexuality in churches do not consider active homosexuality a sin i don t often see the attitude of forgive me and i will try to change instead i see there s nothing wrong with my life and i can be a good christian so it must be you who have an illness because you don t accept me christians can and will accept homosexuals just as they will accept any sinner sure it may be natural to some people to be homosexual but it is also perfectly natural for everyone to sin i was born with a desire to sin but i work to prevent myself from sinning it s much less common now but i still have urges to lash out in anger there also may not be a sudden disappearance of sinful desires or ever so it is sad to see people leave the church when they are discouraged that they are still homosexual after several years darin johnson djohnson ucsd edu particle man particle man doing the things a particle can

re re major views of the trinity in article may athos rutgers edu bocher writes it seems that during the middle ages it was customary for pastors to explain the trinity to their parishoners by analogy to water water is water but can exist in three forms liquid ice and vapor thus it is possible for one essence to exist in three forms this sounds to me like a sort of generic modalism in the the three phases of water are but different modes of behavior of the same physical stuff it certainly does not seem to me to describe the orthodox position of course i suppose that the medieval view of water may have been different but now we know that the phases of water are just different behaviors of the same physical stuff different modes not different identities but perhaps the medieval people did not know that and recently the pastor of my church drew an analogy which i also found useful a woman is often percieved by others in three ways depending on their relationship to her a mother a wife and an employee in a business this is clearly modalistic monarchianism since these three aspects depend solely on point of view and are do not really represent actual variety within the person do you now begin to see why sarima teradata com formerly tdatirv sarima or stanley friesen elsegundoca ncr com

re homosexual issues in christianity in article may athos rutgers edu mserv mozart cc iup edu someone named mark writes mls panix com michael siemon writes homosexual christians have indeed checked out these verses some of them are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations others simply do not address the issues i can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues there are exactly zero verses that clearly address the issues however a couple of them seem as though they do not require incredibly perverse interpretations in order to be seen as condemning homosexuality the kind of interpretation i see as incredibly perverse is that applied to the story of sodom as if it were a blanket equation of homosexual behavior and rape since christians citing the bible in such a context should be presumed to have at least read the story it amounts to slander a charge that homosexuality rape to use that against us do not be deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate nor homosexuals nor thieves nor the covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor swindlers shall inherit the kingdom of god and such were some of you i cor the moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of porneia in this i think we can all agree with paul that there are some kinds of activity that could be named by fornication or theft or coveting or reviling or drunkenness which would well deserve condemnation we may or may not agree to the bounds of those categories however and the very fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at all clear but that paul an excellent rhetorician had no interest in making them clear leaving matters rather to our spirit led decisions with all the uncomfortable living with other readings that has dominated christian discussion of all these areas homosexual behavior is no different i and the other gay christians i know are adamant in condemning rape heterosexual or homosexual and child molestation heterosexual or homosexual and even the possibly harmless but obsessive kinds of sex heterosexual or homosexual that would stand condemned by paul in the very continuation of the chapter you cite may i mildly suggest that what paul does in his letter that you want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning i am free to do anything you say yes but not everything is for my good no doubt i am free to do anything but i for one will not let anything make free with me cor which is a restatement that we must have no other god before god a commandment neither i nor any other gay christian wishes to break some people are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior it is just as wrong though slightly less incendiary so it s a secondary argument from the phobic contingent to equate homosexuality with such behavior as to equate it with the rape of god s messengers i won t deal with the exegesis of leviticus except very tangentially fundamentally you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your assumption that you know what porneia means there are plenty of laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in leviticus most of which christians ignore completely they never even bother to examine them they just assume that they know which ones are moral and which ones are ritual well i have news for you any anthropology course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs unlcean as categories in an awful lot of societies we have them too but buried pretty deep and i cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of leviticus from the ritual law which no christian i know feels applies to us i m dead serious here when people start going on as they do in this matter about how repulsive and unnatural our acts are and what do they know about it huh it is a solid clue to the same sort of arbitrary cultural inculcations as the american prejudice against eating insects on what basis other than assuming your conclusion can you say that the law against male male intercourse in leviticus is not a part of the ritual law for those christians who do think that some parts of leviticus can be law for christians while others are not even to be thought about it is incumbent on you in every case handled on its own merits to determine why you pick one and ignore another i frankly think the whole effort misguided reread paul no doubt i am free to do anything but christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this the great commandment of love for god and neighbor if you cannot go through leviticus and decide each command there on that basis then your own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy in this context it is remarkably offensive to say i notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse well la ti da so what this is almost as slimey an argument as the one that homosexuality rape i know of no one who argues seriously though one can always find jokers in defense of bestiality it is absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay christians do raise which concern sexual activity within committed consensual human adult realtionships so that your bringing it up is no more relevant than the laws of kashrut if you cannot address the actual issues you are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the world if you want to address bestiality that is your business not mine and attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in our culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing us as human beings you want to dismiss us and use the sleaziest means you can think of to do so jesus and paul both expound very explictly and in considerable length the central linch pin of christian moral thought we are required to love one another and all else depends on that gay and lesbian christ ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms and all we get in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side track the issues christians no doubt very sincere ones keep showing up here and in every corner of usenet and the world and all they ever do is spout these same old verses which they obviously have never thought about maybe never even read in total ignorance of the issues raised slandering us with the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can manage to conjure up tossing out red herrings with they suppose great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what it is such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen truth in christ why for god s precious sake do you people quote irrelevant verses to condemn people you don t know and won t even take the trouble to listen to before you start your condemnations is that loving your neighbor god forbid is that how you obey the repeated commands to not judge or condemn others christ and paul spend orders of magnitude more time in insisting on this than the half dozen obscure words in paul that you are so bloody ready to take as license to do what god tells you not to do why for god s sake for god did not send the son into the world to condemn the world but that the world might be saved through him whoever believes in him is not condemned but whoever does not believe has already been condemned for refusing to believe in the name of god s only son now the judgment is this the light has come into the world but men have preferred darkness to light because their deeds were evil for everyone who practices wickedness hates the light and does not come near the light for fear his deeds will be exposed but he who acts in truth comes into the light so that it may be sh own that his deeds are done in god john for long ages we many of us have been confused by evil counsel from evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and rejected some of us despaired and took to courses that probably do show a sinful shunning of god s light blessed are those whose spirits have been crushed by the self righteous they shall be justified however we have seen the truth and the truth is the light of humanity and we now know that it is not we who fear the light but our enemies who fear the light of our

does anyone remember some years ago possibly as many as five there was a discussion on numerology that s where you assign numeric values to letters and then add up the letters in words in an effort to prove something or another i can never make any sense of how it s supposed to work or what it s supposed to prove somebody posted a long article about numerology in the bible saying things like this proves the intricate planning of the scriptures else these patterns would not appear then there was a brilliant followup which was about numerology in all the other numerology posts stuff like the word numerology adds up to and the word appears times in the posting such elegant planning further the word truth also adds up to the writer is using these numerological clues to show us that we reach truth via numerology these examples are made up by me just as examples i really liked that reply because it did such an excellent job of showing that these patterns can be found in just about anything however i did not save a copy of it i do not remember the author i m only sure that it was posted to this newsgroup but on the off chance that somebody remembers it and saved it or that the author is reading here i wanted to know if anyone could send me a copy i think it should be made into an faq if we can find it darren f provine kilroy gboro rowan edu i use not only all the brains i have but all those i can borrow as well woodrow wilson

re faq essay on homosexuality in article may geneva rutgers edu hedrick geneva rutgers edu writes this came from here s his response kinsey see below is the source of the figure percent there was an article in usa today a few months ago showing the results of a study that actually only about were homosexual i saw another figure that listed as the figure of course even if it were that would have little bearing on whether or not it is a sinful behavior how many people have commited other acts of fornication how many people have lied or sinned in other ways but in all fairness the shameless nature of their acts is a reflection of the general spiritual state of the people and not a specific feature of homosexuality why isn t it a specific feature of homosexuality paul describes men with men working that which is unseemly to describe the acts sure there spirtual nature was depraved also and like the other sins the idolatry the other sexual immoraity and the other sins sprang from their depraved spiritual state which was a result of man s not glorifying god as god and being thankful still their acts were shameless homosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases on the other hand none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the subject rom is really about idolatry it refers to homosexuality in passing is everything sinful specifically elaborated on in the new testament scripture does not condemn being a drug dealer being ruled by the spirit rather than the letter not only frees from legalism it also protects us from sins that are against the spirit the word is a two edged sword that cuts both ways i think we must be careful before we totally throw out leviticus if the law is reflection of god s character and true holy nature then those who say that god endorses homosexuality run into a problem if homosexuality were natural whatever that means wholesome endorsed by god and those who oppose sexual behavior are narrow minded biggots as some would have us believe why is there a condemnation of it in leviticus this condemnation is in the midst of all the other sex sin condemnations and there is nothing in the text to say that this law was limited to temple prostitution and no good reason to believe that this was the case furthermore male homosexual sex was a death penalty crime is every sin elaborated on in the new testament take a look at i corinthians paul said that one of the corinthians had broken a law not even heard of among the gentiles that one should have his father s wife there is a prohibition against having your father s wife in leviticus no other new testament verse clearly condemns it besides this one notice that paul did not say that the sin was in commiting adultery etc he spoke against having one s father s wife notice also that this sexual condemnation in leviticus is not mentioned in the specific context of paganism either and there was no pagan coustom mentioned in i corinthians either as a matter of fact taking one s father s wife wasn t even done among the gentiles it was just a plain blantant sin whether worshipping idols was involved or not one commonly made claim is that paul had simply never faced the kinds of questions we are trying to deal with he encountered homosexuality only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was wrong he had never faced the experience of christians who try to act straight and fail and he had never faced christians who are trying to define a christian homosexuality which fits with general christian ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the relationship between god and man it is unfair to take paul s judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make judgements on these questions one of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument is because paul probably did face this and other problems sin can be tough to over come especially without supernatural power is homosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin like lusting after a married woman or sleeping around with people of the opposite sex i doubt it and even if it is that is no excuse god is greater than all of it another reason we reject it is because it ignores the supernatural power of god to intervene in this kind of situation how many people have been set free from sin by the power of god sure there may be any groups that have tried to change homosexuals and failed that is a reflection on the people involved in the program and not god s willingness and ability to change a sinner any program that uses formulas may fail what people need is the power of god to change them whether they are involved in homosexual sin or any other sin i claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual christians is not entirely a theological issue but also a pastoral one paul s tendency as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating holidays is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues to look very carefully at the good of the people involved and to avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging for example while paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat meat he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about which they had personal qualms i don t see how you come to that conclusion paul s dealings with pastorial issues encouraged people to give up their liberties in order to spare others not to allow people to continue in sin because it was just too difficult take the example of eating meat offered to idols paul felt that there was nothing wrong in an abstract sense with eating the meat yet he advised believers to sacrifice their liberty to eat meat in order to spare others but paul never allowed people to sin because living holy was just to tough paul wrote to make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof romans then he goes in to a discourse on how we should sacrifice our own liberty in order to spare the consciences of others suppose it were not a sin for people to practice homosexual acts since others consider it to be a sin then using paul s approach on pastorial issues those who would otherwise be homosexuals should sacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously married to a member of the opposite sex paul never offers a lesser sin homosexual marriage to prevent people from engaging in what may be considered a more damaging sin for another example paul obviously would have preferred to see people at least in some circumstances remain unmarried yet if they were unable to do so he certainly would rather see them married than in a state where they might be tempted to fornication yet marriage itself is not a sin marriage is holy in all and something that god ordains and paul recognizes this note that in the creation story work enters human life as a result of sin this doesn t mean that christians can stop working when we are saved actually adam was put in the garden to tend to it before he fell after he fell he would have to toil over the ground the dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often fails and when it does you end up with damage ranging from psychological damage to suicide as well as broken marriages when attempts at living as a heterosexual fail that is why we are dependent totally on god what a vunerable and glorious position to be it we all must be transformed by the renewing of our minds and that is the only way homosexuals can walk in freedom just like anyone else but i can well imagine paul preferring to see people in long term committed christian relationships than promiscuity as with work which genesis suggests wasn t part of god s original ideal either i think such relationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing god s love with each other i m sure you can see how people with the opposing view see this conclusion it s like saying how should i kill myself with gun or aresenic what about the person who just is overcome with a desire to sleep with goats would it be better for him to sleep with one goat or all of them what about the person who wants to sleep with his aunts would it be better for him to sleep with one aunt or all of them in all these cases the more people or animals one sleeps with the higher the chance that they will get a disease but this only deals with physical aspects of the question whichever sin is commited it all leads to spiritual death cent actions are the same when christian homosexuals say that their relationships are different than the greek homosexuality that paul would have been familiar with this is exactly the same kind of argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors the issue that is most often addressed in scripture seems to be the actual act second isn t it historical snobbery to say that only homosexuals of this century are capable of having loving relationships there are ancient writings glorifying homosexual love btw i am one who believes in refraining from making oathes also where do you get that tax collectors are sinners that s certainly not explicit jesus didn t tell zachias to quit his job link hudson i m reluctant to comment in this in detail our basic concepts of the intention of jesus and paul are greatly different as i indicated in the article whatever the ambiguities of various words and i still think they are significant it does seem clear that paul considered the homosexuality he saw around him wrong what you do with this fact depends upon your basic approach to the bible i m afraid that communication between legalist and anti legalist christians is even harder than between protestants and catholics in the th cent since you disagree with my starting point obviously you re going to disagree with all of the intermediate discussion and conclusions sometimes discussion is still useful i ve seen some very interesting work on paul done by jews obviously they don t agree with him but they sometimes have helpful insight into what he meant but i don t see much sign for hope here in talk religion misc there s an axiom that by the time hitler s name is invoked all hope for sensible discussion is gone on this subject when sleeping with goats is invoked i don t think there s enough basis for understanding to be worth pursuing clh

re portland earthquake austin c archer archau saturn wwc edu wrote i am interested in views about the non event of may seriously how can a christian discriminate between messages from god which are to be taken seriously and those which are spurious is there a useful heuristic which would help us avoid embracing messages which by their non fulfillment are proven to be false thus causing the name of christ to be placed in disrepute is this a problem at all it is possible that the individual saw a true prophetic vision but that he interpreted the scale of time and space according to his material con sciousness translating the supersensible perceptions of a plane above that of time and space into an immediate worldly context and getting it wrong not that he did it rationally but rather that unconsciously the perceptions became clothed in material images instead of remaining in the realm of the potential and not yet time space bound this difficulty of translating prophetic vision into a concrete when and where has always been difficult even for the prophets of old that is why their prophecies are so often subject to multiple interpretations likewise the apostles seemed to feel that the return of the lord was to be very soon in the sense of perhaps the same generation yet the meaning of very soon has proven to be different than they could grasp prophetic vision tends to telescope time so that things that are far off appear to be very close another possibility is that the vision was one of a real event preparing to happen again in the realm of the potential but not yet manifest and which was thwarted by other forces including possibly an act of divine mercy there are many concrete prophecies being made these days by devout and sincere and sober christians and others too it seems that great coming events are really casting their shadow before their arrival in these apocalyptic times the various predictions i m talking about those that appear to be sincere and sober are hard to accept yet hard to ignore com pletely one has the feeling something is about to start to get ready to begin to commence to happen we are living as the chinese saying goes in interesting times as for how to discriminate the bible doesn t help much there is an old testament passage i forget where it is that says you will know whether a prophet is true by whether or not his prophecy comes to pass that helps eliminate the failures after the fact but in the case of an earth quake it is small comfort it seems to me that all prophecies that give specific times and places and events should be suspect not in that they are necessarily false but in the sense stated above that all such visions are subject to mistranslation from the plane of prophetic vision to the plane of earthly time and space for what it is worth rudolf steiner once was asked whether a modern initiate could see into the future and predict coming events his answer was that it would be possible but then he would have to withdraw from active parti cipation in them including proclaiming what he saw if this is in fact a spiritual law then the answer to your question about how to discriminate is that the one who makes such prophecies is probably violating that law knowingly or unknowingly and as such his message should be considered a priori to be dubious i e i would expect that those capable of making true predictions and giving accurate expression to them would not do so in the way that the prophet of the oregon earthquake did however i can sympathize with the person who published the prophecy given the same overwhelming experience that he apparently had i too might feel impelled and even commissioned by god to tell my fellow human beings about what i had seen gerry palo compuserve com do any of our church historian readers know whether there s any more prophecy now than there has been in the past i don t get that impression clh

re deuterocanonicals esp sirach barney resson writes on these counts the apocrapha falls short of the glory of god to quote unger s bible dictionary on the apocrapha they abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and anachronisms so do other parts of the bible when taken literally i e the psalms saying the earth does not move or the implication the earth is flat with four corners etc the bible was written to teach salvation not history or science they teach doctrines which are false and foster practices which are at variance with sacred scripture what ones paryers for the dead or the intercession of saints which are taught in maccabees sirach and tobit they resort to literary types and display an artificiality of subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred scripture by your own subjective judgement this falling short is your judgement and you are not infallible rather the church of jesus christ is see timothy they lack the distinctive elements which give genuine scripture their divine character such as prophetic power and poetic and religious feeling more subjective feelings this is not a proof of anything more than one persons feelings but the problem with this argument lies in the assumption that the hebrew canon included the apocrapha in the first place and it wasn t until the sixteenth century that luther and co threw them out the jewish council you mentioned previously didn t accept them so the reformation protestants had good historical precedence for their actions jerome only translated the apocrapha under protest and it was literally over his dead body that it was included in the catholic canon as i have written time and again the hebrew canon was fixed in jamnia palestine in ad years after the foundation of the one holy catholic and apostolic church furthermore the opinons of jerome do not count he was neither the church or the pope or an ecumenical council or a council in general or an insturment of the magisterium of the church he was a private individual learned admittedly but subject to erro of opinion and in exlcuding the deuterocanon he erred as pope damsus and the council of carthage and the tradition of the fathers clearly shows as i pointed out in my previous post how do you then view the words i warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book if anyone adds anything to them god will add to him the plagues described in this book and if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy god will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the holy city rev i suggest you take heed of the last part of the statement if you want to take it in the sense you are taking it that taking away from the book will cause you to lose heaven it is also noteworthy to consider jesus attitude he had no argument with the pharisees over any of the ot canon john and explained to his followers on the road to emmaus that in the law prophets and psalms which referred to him the ot division of scripture luke as well as in luke taking genesis to chronicles the jewish order we would say genesis to malachi as scripture the order of the canon is unimportant it is the content that matters none of jesus statments exlcude the deuterocanon which were interspersed throughout the canon and remeber there are some completely undisputed books ezra nehemiah esther ecclesiatses song of songs job etc that are not quoted in the new testament which is not taken as prejudicial to their being inspired andy byler
re the doctrine of original sin eugen bigelow writes it is also noteworthy to consider jesus attitude he had no argument with the pharisees over any of the ot canon john and explained to his followers on the road to emmaus that in the law prophets and psalms which referred to him the ot division of scripture luke as well as in luke taking genesis to chronicles the jewish order we would say genesis to malachi as scripture you should remember that in adam s transgression all men and women sinned as paul wrote all of humanity cooperativley reblled against god in adma s sin thus all are subject to it and the sin is transmitted from generation to generation andy byler

re question about hell in article may athos rutgers edu wytten umn cs cs umn edu dale wyttenbach writes what is the basis of the idea of hell being a place of eternal suffering if it is biblical please reference here s my train of thought if god is using the earth to manufacture heavenly beings then it is logical that there would be a certain yield and a certain amount of waste the yield goes to heaven and the waste is burned destroyed in hell why is it necessary to punish the waste rather than just destroy it luke talks about the rich man and lazarus matthew talks about the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels revelations and reference this fire as the place where unbelievers are thrown matthew talks about being thrown into the eternal fire and the fire of hell it seems quite clear that there is this place where a fire burns forever from the revelations passages it is clear that the devil and his angels will be tormented there forever from the matthew passage it doesn t seem abundantly clear whether the punishment of unbelievers is everlasting in the sense of final or in the sense of continual from dale s question i come away with the suggestion that hell if it were short might be an acceptable alternative to living forever with the source of life peace and joy i e the unbeliever ceases to exist whereas if punishment goes on continually then one should have a greater motivation to avoid it it definately seems to me that hell is something we want to avoid regardless of its exact nature there seem to be two main questions in dale s thought what is god s main plan on earth why is continual punishment a necessary part of hell as opposed to simply destroying completely those who refuse god i believe that god s main plan is to have a genuine relationship with people the nature of hell and the reasons for its nature seem a lot more difficult to ascertain it does seem clear that hell is something to avoid at a minimum hell is the state one is in when one has nothing to do with god in the bible i am not aware of any discussion about the specifics of hell beyond the general of hot unpleasant and torment for instance it is not discussed how if at all the rich man can continually stay in the fire and still feel discomfort or pain or whether there is some point at which the pain sensing ability is burned up if you can forgive the graphicalness if you throw a physical body into a fire assuming the person starts out alive at some fairly quick point the nerves are destroyed and pain is no longer sensed it is not stated what occurs when at the judgement the unbelievers who are already physically dead are cast into hell i e they no longer have a physical body so they can t feel physical pain what could be sensed continually is that those in hell are to be forever without god the lazarus rich man parable is told with the idea of having the listener think in physical terms in order to get the point that some people won t listen to god even after he rises from the dead the point of the parable is to reach the hard hearted here who are not listening to the fact of the resurrection nor the gospel about jesus christ it seems reasonable to also draw from the parable that hell is not even remotely pleasant peter white disclaimer none of what is written necessarily reflects a view of my company phil i want to know christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in niv his sufferings becoming like him in his death
re homosexuality issues in christianity in article athos rutgers edu carlson ab larc nasa gov ann carlson writes anyone who thinks being gay and christianity are not compatible should check out dignity integrity more light presbyterian churches affirmation mcc churches etc meet some gay christians find out who they are pray with them discuss scripture with them and only then form your opinion if you were to start your own religion this would be fine but there is no scriptural basis for your statement in fact it really gets to the heart of the problem you think you know more than scripture your faith is driven by feel goodism and not by the word of god just because they are nice people doesn t make it right you can start all the churches you want and it won t change the fact that it is wrong that is not to imply that gays don t deserve the same love and forgiveness that anyone else does but to call their behavior right just because they are nice people is baseless and it offers satan a perfect place to work because there is no check on what he is doing i suspect ann was suggesting that you look to see whether the spirit is alive among them not whether they are nice people though there s something to be said for being nice too clh

love in the morning by malcolm smith ministries begin included message the following teaching is brought to you on behalf of malcolm smith ministries a ministry dedicated to leading believers everywhere into a knowledge of the love of god if you would like more info on the ministry and or would like to comment on whether you found this teaching beneficial e mail to randy hunt at rlhunt hou amoco com love in the morning psalm by malcolm smith moses wrote this prayer at a weary time in the history of israel a generation before the time of its writing the people of israel had stood at kadesh gateway to canaan and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather than god s way they refused an adventure of faith in god which would have given them canaan the homeland of promise god honored their decision and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the land of promise until they were all buried in the sand the young decision makers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old and destined to be dead within forty years bleached bones in the desert by the time they were seventy eighty at the most the lives of these wanderers had been unending sadness moses described it as ending each year with a sigh v the fact that they knew give or take a few months when they were going to die underscored the meaninglessness of their existence whatever heights of success they reached they would be a heap of bleached bones within forty years the only ones to live outside of that depression of hopeless disbelief were joshua and caleb who had stood against the nation at kadesh and had god s promise of one day entering the land the forty year period was finally drawing to an end the new generation those who were children at kadesh were now grown and eager to take the inheritance their parents had refused to enjoy in the light of this moses prays it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over all these years as moses had walked with these moaning and complaining people through the wilderness of their exile he had carried a double burden his was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been but he also knew why they had chosen as they had at kadesh the problem was that they were ignorant of the character of their god if asked who is your god they would have described him as the god who is power when aaron had created their concept of god in an idol he chose a calf or young bull a symbol of power of virility in their minds god was the young bull who had impaled pharaoh on his horns and gored egypt s gods as he led israel to sinai but when man worships a god of power his miracles grow thin and even boring after miracle food on the desert floor and water gushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland the god of almightiness becomes ho hum what s next on the miracle menu and a god of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf he might be all they need but then who knows if he has all power he has a right to do whatever he wants whenever he wants the only person these people had known who had absolute power was pharaoh and men s lives had hung on the whim of his moods which could change with the wind they believed god could work his wonders on their behalf but they did not know him and so could not trust him israel had a god based on what he did his acts moses knew the heart of god the motivation behind the acts from the day of his encounter at the burning bush moses had been fascinated by god at sinai he asked to be shown his glory to know who he really was he had seen what god had done he wanted to know who god was this request was granted and moses was given a glimpse of god s glorious person he had come to know the heart of god as compassion and lovingkindness exodus the word lovingkindness is not to be understood as a human kind of love it speaks of the kind of relationship arising out of the making of a covenant it can only be understood as the love that says i will never leave you nor forsake you lovingkindness is as tenacious as a british bulldog when the world walks out this love digs in its heels and refuses to leave and it is not human romantic love based on feelings and rooted in emotions it is a love of covenant commitment and therefore operates quite apart from feelings god s love is not an emotion that wavers day by day it is the total commitment of his being to seek our highest and best and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans god does not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses his feelings of love toward us we do not woo him and cause him to fall in love with us if that were the case the first ugly sinful thing we did would cause him to reject us he is love and he loves us because of who he is not because of who we are he does not love what we do but he is committed to us pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness he will not let us go his is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us but a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us it is saying to the recipient for as long as we shall live i am for you the god who has revealed himself to man through scripture and finally in jesus in his coming and in his death and resurrection is the god who is lovingkindness thus he loves us and gives himself to us he will never leave us nor forsake us tragically many believers have never seen him as love they see him as power no one will come to faith by just seeing miracles miracles point to who he is and that is when faith springs in the heart israel did not see god as lovingkindness they saw his acts of power moses knew his ways the kind of god he was and the love that he had for these people because of their total lack of understanding of his love they could not trust him to be their strength in taking the land faith is born out of knowing the love he has for us it is the resting response to the one who gives himself to us he is not the force and to call him the almighty is to miss his heart he is love who is the almighty and the infinite force if man is to make force or raw power work for him he must depend on knowing the forrnula and have faith in it but the power that issues from love demands faith in the person of love himself the forty years of meaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to know the god of love at this point with the new generation and the possibility of enjoying all that god promised moses prays verse the language moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its mother s love now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes it is waking to the consciousness of being loved watched over cared for protected fed and cleaned day and night by the mother suppose we were to ask what has the baby done to deserve this or have arrangements been made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience our questions would be considered unnatural even immoral the child was conceived in love anticipated and prepared for with love s excitement a love that has been to the gates of death to bring it into being the parents love is unconditional spontaneous it has nothing to do with the looks of the child or its performance so god is love he loves us unconditionally spontaneously we were conceived in his imagination and fashioned after his image to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the lord jesus it is slanderous and immoral to even ask what we must do to earn and deserve that love the child discovers its personhood and identity through the eyes and touch through the cuddles of its parents love it is a scientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or if it survives will have severe emotional problems and a person who has been held and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the embrace and knowledge of love from god moses prays that the new generation will learn to wake every morning resting with total confidence in the love of god and will receive all his promises and blessings with joy and gladness significantly moses prays that they will be satisfied with his love satisfied in the hebrew language is a rich picture word describing being filled with an abundance of gourmet food it is also used to describe the earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received enough water moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be drenched in the life giving love of god that sense of satisfaction is the lifelong quest of every man and woman when we are satisfied in our deepest selves many of our emotional and even our physical problems disappear man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling that he is fulfilled as a human being his hours have meaning which make sense out of the ordinary and mundane apart from god man seeks this satisfaction through intellectual pursuit through the exciting of the emotions and through the feeding of his body he will even seek it in religious exercise but man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding to the love of the living god only in knowing god s love will the rest of life make sense as the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again became the inheritance to be taken moses prayed this psalm i find it fascinating that he should pray and ask god for a daily revelation of his love considering the awe with which the people held moses one would think he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and by the knowledge they gained they would live in it but moses knew better god is the only one who can make known to us his love we won t find it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to manipulate him nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and give us god feelings it is god himself the lover who must open our eyes and satisfy us with his love this prayer is man in helplessness asking god to make the love he is real in our hearts moses prayer was partially answered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which worked by love in the book of judges but it would not be answered in its fullest dimensions until the coming of the holy spirit who pours out the love of god in our hearts romans in the history of the early church we read of the holy spirit falling upon the believers this is an ancient expression that in modern english means to give a bear hug it is used in luke to describe the father running to the prodigal and falling on his neck and kissing him the holy spirit is god hugging you in your deepest self and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your being this is not a one time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes moses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization that we are loved the world and much of our religious training has taught us to perform in order to be accepted we have spent far too long living in a state of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves to find acceptance and love from others and from god we now come humbled to receive love we cannot earn to be still and let him tell us we are loved to let the holy spirit descend into us pouring out the love of god we come in stillness to think on and repeat his words of love to our minds which have been jaded with the doctrine of perform to be accepted we begin to realize that he loves us as we are and gives meaning and purpose to all of life i challenge everyone reading this to begin each day from the moment you open your eyes by celebrating the god of love and praying this prayer you may not feel anything but something always happens i was x rayed the other day i did not see or feel anything but i noted that the technicians kept behind protective walls they know you cannot be exposed to those rays without being affected so it is as we consciously begin our day knowing that we are loved such experiential knowledge will produce according to moses joy and gladness all our days joy is the result of a life that is functioning as god intended us to function when he made us you might say that joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance man s highest performance is to rest in the love god has for him the hum will be joy and the result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now has in life stop wandering in the wilderness be satisfied with his love and in joy day by day receive all his promised blessings end included message

re major views of the trinity in article may athos rutgers edu you write i fear orthodox theologians have been overly in love with paradox to the extent that well meaning people think they ve just flat out confused there s no problem with things being both and e g if the are different parts of the but they re in some way different aspects modes or whatever of one god if you accept economic trinitarianism it s possible that you don t have any substantive difference with the standard view is it possible that you just don t find the neo platonic explanation illuminating clh i would put it stronger than that i consider it nonsense simply put i do not see any way that a platonic essence could have any real existance essence in the platonic sense does not have any referent as far as i can tell it is just an imaginary concept invented to provide an explanation for things better explained in other ways so to attribute an essence to god is to attribute to him something that does not exist thus the orthodox platonic formulation seems to leave the unity of god in limbo since it is based on a non existant essence thus failing to avoid the very problem it was supposed to address thus to me the unity of god must be primary and the triality must be secondary must be modal or aspectual relating to roles or to modes of interaction since otherwise there is no meaning to saying god is one sarima teradata com formerly tdatirv sarima or stanley friesen elsegundoca ncr com i think one can read augustine as saying something consistent with your comments his de trinitate which has been very influential in the west defines the distinction among the persons relationally you re probably at one extreme of orthodox views but i m not sure your views are necessary incompatible with the trinity clh

re baptism requires faith aaron aaron bryce cardenas aaronc athena mit edu writes aaron colossians in him you were also circumcised in the aaron putting off of the sinful nature not with a circumcision done aaron by christ having been buried with him in baptism and raised aaron with him through your faith in the power of god who raised him aaron from the dead aaron in baptism we are raised to a new life in christ romans aaron through a personal faith in the power of god our parent s aaron faith cannot do this do infants have faith let s look at aaron what the bible has to say about it yes let do try and if anyone causes one of these little ones who believes in me to sin it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around his neck mark let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of god belongs to such as these i tell you the truth anyone who will not receive the kingdom of god like a little child will never enter it the colossians passage does not make faith a requirement for baptism it merely says that in baptism we are born again regenerated and resurrected through faith in the case of an infant i would say that baptism works faith in the heart of the infant through the power of the word the colossians passage does make baptism a spiritual circumcision circumcision was the means by which a male infant was made a part of god s covenant with israel it was commanded to be performed on the eighth day the early church understood this and even debated whether baptism had to be performed on the eighth day or if it could in fact be done earlier aaron romans but not all the israelites accepted the good aaron news for isaiah says lord who has believed our message aaron consequently faith comes from hearing the message and the aaron message is heard through the word of christ aaron so then we receive god s gift of faith to us as we hear the aaron message of the gospel and the gospel is surely preached at any infant s or adult s baptism indeed in a very real sense the sacraments are the gospel made tangible aaron faith is a possible response to hearing aaron god s word preached kids are not yet spiritually aaron intellectually or emotionally mature enough to respond to aaron god s word how do you know they are not yet mature enough to have faith do you know this on the basis of god s word or from your own reason faith is also described as a gift from god ephesians he gives faith to infants just as he gives it to adults through the power of the gospel romans aaron if you read all of ezekiel you will see that god doesn t aaron hold us guilty for anyone else s sins so we can have no aaron original guilt from adam here you show that you just don t understand original sin you are arguing against a straw man maybe you ve been talking to catholics too much i don t know but original sin does not consist of god s imputation of adam s guilt to us it consists of our inheritance of adam s sinful nature it is actual sin see for example the augsburg confession article ii and the apology of the augsburg confession article ii and for extra credit john knox s the scots confession article iii aaron now then that we have a little more background as to why aaron original sin is not biblical let s look at some of the aaron scriptures used to support it aaron romans therefore just as sin entered the world through aaron one man and death through sin and in this way death came to aaron all men because all sinned ask yourself this question do infants ever die then ask yourself if infant baptism is not valid then where was the christian church during all the centuries when almost all of the baptisms were performed on infants were luther melancthon calvin zwingli hus knox andrae and chemnitz christians aaron psalm surely i was sinful at birth sinful from the time aaron my mother conceived me aaron this whole psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble aaron ourselves before god in repentance for sinning david himself aaron was a man after god s own heart and wrote the psalm after aaron committing adultry with bathsheba and murdering her husband aaron all that david is saying here is that he can t remember a time aaron when he wasn t sinful he is humbling himself before god by aaron confessing his sinfulness his saying that he was sinful at aaron birth is a hyperbole the bible being inspired by god isn t aaron limited to a literal interpetation but also uses figures of aaron speech as did jesus john for another example of aaron hyperbole see luke who are you to say what is literal and what is not is a literal interpretation manifestly absurd in psalm by reason of direct contradiction with a clear passage from the word of god you might also compare genesis the lord smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart never again will i curse the ground because of man even though every inclination of his heart is evil from childhood aaron we see aaron that he did grow and become wiser in luke and the aaron implication is that jesus did wrong things as a child before he aaron knew to choose right over wrong you are a long way from proving this rather monstrous assertion all you can say is that jesus grew in wisdom and in stature a conclusion that he did wrong as a child is based on an extrapolation of reason not on a direct revelation in scripture david h wagner but mad reason rushes forth and a confessional lutheran because baptism is not dazzling like the works which we do regards it as worthless martin luther large catechism fourth

re public private revelation formerly re question about virgin mary marty helgesen writes when an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention the church may investigate it if the investigation indicates a likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from god it will be approved that means that it can be preached in the church however it is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from god a catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved private revelations such as those at fatima and lourdes i suspect that few if any catholics do reject fatima and lourdes but if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not orthodox catholics in good standing it may be a bit much to say that a catholic is free to deny what happened at fatima that s a bit strong it is sort of like saying that a catholic is free to deny that hong kong exists what a catholic is free to do is to deny the truth of fatima without being called a heretic you can be labeled other things for such an offense but not a heretic theologians make a basic distinction as far as the degree of assent one must give to events like fatima and lourdes things revealed by god through jesus christ or his apostles must be given the assent due to a revelation of god total and unswerving fatima and lourdes demand our assent as much as any other well attested event in human history perhaps a bit more given the approval of the church approval of an apparition by the church principally means that whatever happened was in harmony with the catholic faith i personally think of private revelations as our lord s way of telling us what to do at particular periods in history he gave us all the doctrines etc years ago but we can always use some help in knowing how exactly to apply what he gave us catholic devotion to the sacred heart was a result of a series of apparitions to st margaret mary alacoque for example the problem at the time was extreme moral rigorism that was turning our lord into someone without a heart the fatima apparitions were a warning of an impending crisis in the church we are living it and what to do to save the most souls possible in such a situation

re baptism requires faith aaron bryce cardenas writes romans but not all the israelites accepted the good news for isaiah says lord who has believed our message consequently faith comes from hearing the message and the message is heard through the word of christ so then we receive god s gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the gospel faith is a possible response to hearing god s word preached kids are not yet spiritually intellectually or emotionally mature enough to respond to god s word hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot be raised in baptism to a new life catholics view the effects of baptism slightly differently and that s one primary reason why they baptize babies they believe that baptism produces a change in the soul of the baby quite independently of any volitional act on the part of the baby this change in the baby s soul gives the infant certain capabilities that he would not have without baptism since the infant does not have the use of his intellect and will yet these new faculties are dormant but as the child gets older the gifts of baptism come more and more into play ezekiel the soul who sins will die the son will not share the guilt of the father nor will the father share the guilt of the son the righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him if you read all of ezekiel you will see that god doesn t hold us guilty for anyone else s sins so we can have no original guilt from adam adam was given a number of gifts by god the chief among them was what catholics call sanctifying grace in the new testament the word used for this is charity by his sin adam lost this grace he didn t lose it just for himself however he lost it for the whole human race because once he lost it he couldn t pass it on to his descendents that s why catholics baptize babies through his original sin adam lost sanctifying grace for all his descendents christ instituted baptism to give it back to everyone babies are not being punished for anything they personally did they are simply lacking in something they need in order to enter heaven

re definition of christianity in article may athos rutgers edu clh writes often we get into discussions about who is christian unfortunately there are a number of possible definitions starting from the broadest commonly used definitions are the next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition which includes all of the major strands of christianity but excludes groups that are felt to be outside historic christianity this is of course a slippery enterprise since catholics could argue that protestants are outside historic christianity etc but i think the most commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the nicene creed and the formula of chalcedon are you sure you want to include chalcedon here i presume that you mean the description of jesus as fully human and fully devine almost everyone would consider the majority of copts and armenians and the jacobites as christians yet for centuries it has been maintained that they disagree with the formula of chalcedon those that wouldn t consider them christians are most likely to object that these communities don t require a personal commitment to jesus which is only tangentially related to the formula of chalcedon thanks john kolassa kolassa bio bst rochester edu as i understand the recent discussion here the copts for all practical purposes accept chalcedon they talk about one nature rather than two but the issue seems to be one of terminology rather than substance clh

ten commandments or ten discourses in the course of discussing the sabbath with some folks i came across something that was completely new to me and i thought i d offer it for comment to keep this as brief as possible let me state my observation as a declarative statement and then whoever wants to can comment on it basically what i think i ve observed is that the phrase the ten commandments as used by moses is not a reference to ex but rather a reference to ten distinct discourses from ex through ex that is the phrase the ten commandments should more accurately be translated the ten discourses of which the passage we call the ten commandments is really only the first i m not completely convinced that the above is true but for purposes of discussion let me argue it as though i was sure arguments supporting the above idea there aren t really ten commandments in ex in order to get commandments you have to get two of them out of verses and the verses themselves do not support such a division because they are all about not worshipping other gods that is verse commands to have no other gods and verse commands to not worship the idols mentioned in verse you can t violate verses without violating verse indicating that the whole passage is one command and leaving us with only nine commandments i could go on at length about this but for now i ll just stop with this summary there are ten speeches between ex the beginning of the traditional ten commandments and ex where god actually gives moses the two tablets with the ten commandments discourses written on them i break these ten down as follows and in most cases each of these passages begins with some variation of the phrase and the lord spoke to moses saying the exception is ex which begins now these are the ordinances which you are to set before them the word translated commandments in the phrase the ten commandments isn t really the word for commandment its the word for a speech or an utterance it s a word often used for longer discourses rather than individual statements for instance when combined with the word yom day this word is translated chronicles in such phrases as now the rest of the acts of so and so are they not written in the chronicles of x the word for commandment is freely used throughout the books of moses and perhaps it is significant that when moses spoke of the ten x s he appears to have avoided the word for commandment and chosen instead a word associated with discourses longer than just a single command god tells moses that he is going to give him the stone tablets with the law and the commandments ex yet he does not give moses the tablets until he has finished all ten discourses on mount sinai if the ten commandments were only ex it is not immediately clear why god would wait several days and nine more discourses before giving these tablets to moses on the other hand if we have the ten discourses written on the tablets then it makes perfect sense that god would not give moses the tablets until he had finished delivering all ten discourses when moses did get the tablets he found that both tablets were written on both sides ex if these ten commandments were only the first verses of ex god would have had to have written in large letters not that he couldn t have of course but it does seem more likely to me that this is a reference to two tablets containing ten discourses written in normal sized letters in ii cor paul seems to specifically single out the commandments written on stone as being the ministry of death that which is fading away and the ministry of condemnation with the possible exception of the commandment about the sabbath it is difficult to see why paul would refer to the commands in ex as being temporary fading away type commandments this is less of a problem if the stone tablets should happen to have included all of the commandments from ex through ex arguments against this idea the main argument against this idea aside from the fact that it contradicts a long standing tradition is that in dt moses says after quoting the commands in ex these words the lord spoke and he added no more and he wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me this appears to identify the words just quoted as being the only contents of the two stone tablets that was my first impression anyway however after some thought i noted that a great deal hinges on how you understand the phrase these words if moses meant these words which i have just related to you were spoken by god etc then that would mean that only the traditional ten commandments were on the stone tablets if however moses was making a parenthetical comment these words which i am now telling you were spoken by god etc then that s quite different i did note that in the dt account moses tells of being given the stone tablets before telling of the people asking moses to represent them before god whereas in the exodus account the people asked this of moses between the first and second discourses several days before god gave moses the stone tablets this reinforces the idea that moses remarks in dt ff were intended as a parenthetical remark rather than a strictly chronological account of when god wrote what and at what point he stopped adding to what was on the tablets summary all things considered i find it somewhat more likely that the nine commands in ex are really only the first of what moses regarded as the ten discourses of god i don t know if anybody has ever espoused this idea before it s brand new to me so while i lean towards accepting it i would be very interested in hearing any comments and criticisms anyone may care to offer mark

homosexuals several replies to my post have said that i should get to know christian homosexuals before judging them i maintain that i was not judging them by saying that homosexuality is wrong i would like to look at the responces to my post and make a general sterotypical evaluation of the people who responded to the side of christianity and homosexuality being compatible admitedly not all are homosexuals but i know that many are from their e mail responces i don t normally make sterotypical assumptions about groups of people but since i have been asked to by many of the opposing veiw point i will so far people have made wild assumptions put me down because i don t have the resources of others and even reverted to name calling if you don t think this is an acurate representation then those of you who are homosexual christians show me the diffrence in christ s love bryan
homosexuality recently an e mail to me mentioned technically the messengers aren t even human so it can t be a case of homosexuality even of rape the jude reference to sodom is also meaningful only in the context of the sodomites lust for the other flesh of angels again application to homosexual behavior in general or to the position of gay christians is largeely specious are angels flesh no i feel that this is saying that it was because of their lust after other men who are flesh or of this world what are other opinons on this i haven t heard much about this verse at all in christ s love bryan
hell on april stephen mcintyre writes i would rather spend an eternity in hell than be beside god in heaven knowing that even one man would spend his eternal life being scorched for his wrongdoings stephen i suspect that when you and i use the word hell we have different concepts in mind when you encounter references to heaven in terms of crowns and harps and golden streets i trust that you do not suppose or suspect christians of supposing that the golden streets are to be taken literally still less that they are what the concept of heaven is all about why then should you suppose that about the fires of hell have you read the novel atlas shrugged do you remember the last description of james taggart sitting on the floor beside the ferris persuader this comes close to a description of what is meant by hell in my circles if the image of fire is often used in this connection there are two reasons that occur to me the first reason is that it conveys the idea of hell as something that any rational being would earnestly wish to avoid as any rational being would wish to avoid the fate of james taggart but the latter image is meaningful only to those who have read atlas shrugged a smaller audience than those who have played with matches the second reason is the history of the hebrew word gehenna one of the words translated hell in the new testament it refers to the valley of hinnon outside jerusalem in early days it was a place where the canaanites offered human sacrifices burned alive to molech later it was made a garbage or refuse dump where fires burned continually consuming the trash of the city of jerusalem to be cast into gehenna or to burn in gehenna thus became a metaphor for to be rejected or discarded as worthless lest you think that identifying hell with the fate of james taggart is my own private fancy i commend to you the book the great divorce by c s lewis it discusses heaven no harps and hell no flames it is shorter than atlas shrugged and available at most bookstores and libraries yours james kiefer

re baptism requires faith in article may athos rutgers edu aaronc athena mit edu aaron bryce cardenas writes colossians in him you were also circumcised in the putting off of the sinful nature not with a circumcision done by christ having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the power of god who raised him from the dead in baptism we are raised to a new life in christ romans through a personal faith in the power of god our parent s faith cannot do this do infants have faith let s look at what the bible has to say about it i don t think the issue of whether infants have faith is relevant or not certainly they can as the example of john in utero proves i find the translation of col above odd in terms of the circumcision of christ which the kjv and rsv put in terms of christ s cricumcision which we in union with him participate in putting off the body of sins of the flesh also perhaps cor is dividing the act of burial with him in baptism which can be independant of faith from the experience of rising with christ by faith who says both are by faith this interpretation has the advantage of explaining those who are faithlessly baptized for whom their baptisim is not benefit but serves to put them into the kingdom nonetheless like the israelites all of them children included who were baptized in the cloud and in the sea it was of no advantage because they did not add to their baptism faith and obedience baptism does not impart faith nor is it done strictly speaking on the basis of the faith of the parent but because of the covcenant promise of god it imparts grace the grace of the kingdom which can be a punishement in disguise if there is later apostacy romans but not all the israelites accepted the good news for isaiah says lord who has believed our message consequently faith comes from hearing the message and the message is heard through the word of christ so then we receive god s gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the gospel faith is a possible response to hearing god s word preached kids are not yet spiritually intellectually or emotionally mature enough to respond to god s word hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot be raised in baptism to a new life do you teach a child to pray the lord s prayer do you expect them to not steal they can have faith appropriate to their condition and in the new covenant we shall no longer say know the lord for they shall all know him from the least unto the greatest heb if you read all of ezekiel you will see that god doesn t hold us guilty for anyone else s sins so we can have no original guilt from adam but also according to ezekiel god will not hold innocent anyone on the basis of anyone elses innocense thus jesus could not be our federal head any more than adam if that s what ezekiel is talking about shall you make ezekiel contradict the second commandemnt as well ezekiel rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted and get a new heart and a new spirit why will you die o house of israel for i take no pleasure in the death of anyone declares the sovereign lord repent and live the way to please god is to repent and get a new heart and spirit kids cannot do this acts says that when we repent and are baptized we will then receive a new spirit the holy spirit then we shall live ezekiel indicates that this new heart will be given by god in the context of the sprinkling of water in baptism it is the action of god puting them into his new order and not a question of personal faith as such romans therefore just as sin entered the world through one man and death through sin and in this way death came to all men because all sinned sin and death entered the world when the first man sinned death came to each man because each man sinned note that it s good to read through all of romans some of the verses are easier to misunderstand than others but if we read them in context we will see that they are all saying basically the same thing let s look at one such but the death that came to all because of sin is not just their personal death but the dead state originbal sin we are in a covenant of death because adam our federal head gave over his dominion to the devil and death psalm surely i was sinful at birth sinful from the time my mother conceived me this whole psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselves before god in repentance for sinning david himself was a man after god s own heart and wrote the psalm after committing adultry with bathsheba and murdering her husband all that david is saying here is that he can t remember a time when he wasn t sinful he is humbling himself before god by confessing his sinfulness his saying that he was sinful at birth is a hyperbole the bible being inspired by god isn t limited to a literal interpetation but also uses figures of speech as did jesus john for another example of hyperbole see luke while this psalm is figurative in it s language it is not hyperbolic and the one does not necessarily imply the other there is not other hyperbolic language in this psalm what v is likely refering to is what is symbolized by the ot cleanliness laws which make intercourse and childbrith both acts which caus uncleannes and seperation from god the whole psalm is in the language of ot ritual hyssop cleansing burnt offering etc david s sin with bathsheba included this element as he did not ritually cleanse himself when he should have but what was symbolized by the ot ritual was the truth that sin was passed generationally that s why the organ of generation had to be cut that s why brith was unclean uncleanness was death and all babies were born dead and needed to be washed to newness of life which we have in baptism today

re hate the sin in article may athos rutgers edu scott prism gatech edu scott holt writes hate begets more hate never love consider some sin i ll leave it unnamed since i don t want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not something is a sin now lets apply our hate the sin philosophy and see what happens if we truly hate the sin then the more we see it the stronger our hatred of it will become eventually this hate becomes so strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate the sinner though you can certaily assert all this i don t see why it necessarily has to be the case why can t hate just stay as it is and not beget more who says we have to get disgusted and start hating the sinner i admit this happens but i donlt think you can say it is always necessaily so why can we not hate with a perfect hatred in the summary of the law christ commands us to love god and to love our neighbors he doesn t say anything about hate in fact if anything he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves so how are christians supposed to deal with the sin of others i suppose that there is only one way to deal with sin either in others or ourselves through prayer we certainly we should love even our enemies amos says to hate the evil and love the good this can t contradict christ s teaching i think we tie up both hate and love with an emotional attitude when it really should be considered more objectively surely i don t fly into a rage at every sin i see but why can i not hate it paul duggan

arsenokoitai bailey boswell continuing with dr deyoung s article survey of new interpretations of arsenokoitai d s bailey d s bailey was perhaps the trailblazer of new assessments of the meaning of arsenokoitai he takes the term in i cor as denoting males who actively engage in homosexual acts in contrast to malakoi effeminate those who engage passively in such acts however he insists that paul knew nothing of inversion as an inherited trait or an inherent condition due to psychological or glandular causes and consequently regards all homosexual practice as evidence of perversion hence bailey limits the term s reference in paul s works to acts alone and laments modern translations of the term as homosexuals bailey wants to distinguish between the homosexual condition which is morally neutral and homosexual practices italics in source paul is precise in his terminology and moffatt s translation sodomites best represents paul s meaning in bailey s judgment bailey clearly denies that the homosexual condition was known by biblical writers j boswell the most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary authors is that of john boswell whereas the usual translation of this term gives it either explicitly or implicitly an active sense boswell gives it a passive sense in an extended discussion of the term he cites linguistic evidence and common sense to support his conclusion that the word means male sexual agents i e active male prostitutes his argument is that the arseno part of the word is adjectival not the object of the koitai which refers to base sexual activity hence the term according to boswell designates a male sexual person or male prostitute he acknowledges however that most interpret the composite term as active meaning those who sleep with make their bed with men boswell bases his interpretation on linguistics and the historical setting he argues that in some compounds such as paidomathes child learner the paido is the subject of manthano and in others such as paidoporos through which a child passes the paido is neither subject nor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance his point is that each compound must be individually analyzed for its meaning more directly he maintains that compounds with the attic form arreno employ it objectively while those with the hellenistic arseno use it as an adjective yet he admits exceptions to this distinction regarding arreno boswell next appeals to the latin of the time namely drauci or exoleti these were male prostitutes having men or women as their objects the greek arsenokoitai is the equivalent of the latin drauci the corresponding passive would be parakoitai one who lies beside boswell affirms he claims that arsenokoitai was the most explicit word available to paul for a male prostitute since by paul s time the attic words pornos fornicator and porneuon one committing fornication found also in the lxx had been adopted to refer to men who resorted to female prostitutes or simply committed fornication in the absence of the term from pagan writers such as herodotus plato aristotle and plutarch and from the jewish writers philo and josephus boswell finds even more convincing evidence for his affirmation that arsenokoitai did not connote homosexual or even sodomite in the time of paul he also demonstrates its absence in pseudo lucian sextus empiricus and libanius he subsequently finds it lacking in all discussions of homosexual relation among christian sources in greek including the didache tatian justin martyr eusebius clement of alexandria gregory of nyssa and john chrysostom chrysostom is singled out for his omission as final proof that the word could not mean homosexuality boswell next appeals to the omission of the texts of i cor and i tim from discussions of homosexuality among latin church fathers cited are tertullian arnobius lactantius and augustine the last named uses circumlocutions other latin writers include ausonius cyprian and minucius felix the term is also lacking in state and in church legislation by the sixth century the term became confused and was applied to a variety of sexual activities from child molesting to anal intercourse between a husband and wife having surveyed the sources boswell concludes there is no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connoted homosexuality in the time of paul or for centuries thereafter and every reason to suppose that whatever they came to mean they were not determinative of christian opinion on the morality of homosexual acts it is clear throughout that boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to male prostitutes he even goes so far as to conclude that paul would probably not disapprove of gay inclination gay relationships enduring love

re bernadette dates jek cu nih gov writes joe moore writes mary at that time appeared to a girl named bernadette at lourdes she referred to herself as the immaculate conception since a nine year old would have no way of knowing about the doctrine the apparition was deemed to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine bernadette was years old when she had her visions in four years after the dogma had been officially proclaimed by the pope yours james kiefer i forgot exactly what her age was but i remember clearly that she was born in a family of poverty and she did not have any education whatsoever at the age of the apparitions she suffered from asthma at that age and she and her family were living in a prison cell of some sort she had to ask the lady several times in her apparitions about what her name was since her confessor priest asked her to do so for several instances the priest did not get an answer since bernadette did not receive any one time after several apparitions passed the lady finally said i am the immaculate conception so bernadette was so happy and repeated these words over and over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the priest who was asking so when she told the priest the priest was shocked and asked bernadette do you know what you are talking about bernadette did not know what exactly it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for the priest the priest continued with how did you remember this if you do not know bernadette answered honestly that she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her way to the priest the priest knew about the dogma being four years old then but bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic personal revelation of our lady to bernadette note this lady of lourdes shrine has a spring of water which our lady requested bernadette to dig up herself with her bare hands in front of pilgrims at the start little water flowed but after several years there is more water flowing marida spreading god s words through actions mother teresa

thanks for all of the great scripture verses it was a pleasure to read them my reply you are welcome zane zane i am sure nothing that i will say will change your mind about it but i would like to ask you if the book in question really does anything for you i mean were you all caught up in the word faith thing but now that you have read the book you ve been rescued from all of the error and pain that will result in your christian life my reply when i first became a christian i entered into the word faith movement it was easy i wasn t grounded in the word of god and sound doctrine when i visited christian book stores the cheapest books i could find to buy were the and books by hagin and others consequently i began receiving hagin s monthly magazine and they still send it to me and also copeland s also still sent to me it wasn t until i read a booklet by jimmy swaggart called hyper faith the new gnosticism that i began to realize the teachings i were partaking of were error i started reading the bible more and studying more sure enough jimmy was right in many points as part of my experience i am alerting christians particularly new christians that these teachings are heretical and they need to do as the bereans did in acts check these teachings out with scripture my brother in law was involved in a word faith cult in my area it s leader is real good friends with benny hinn rather then going into much detail about this suffice it to say he was deceived mistreated and has now fallen into atheism i m still praying for him phil the assistant pastor at the church i teach adult sunday school in has been a follower of copeland for years he has thousands of tapes by the faith teachers in the class recently i quoted several of the teachers heretical statements to his surprise since then i ve been able to talk to him at length about these issues the leader of the women s group at my church is a benny hinn fan recently i found that she has been lending good morning holy spirit to women in the church that prompted my quotes in sunday school as well as my lending cic to people in the church i m well aware of the abuses and heresies perpetrated in this movement and have an urgency in my heart and life to warn people about the heresies what heresies a jesus became sin took on the very nature of the devil and became one with him b jesus death on the cross wasn t enough to atone c jesus was dragged to hell after his death was beat and abused by satan and demons thus finishing our atonement satan was ruling over him there d jesus was born again in hell e jesus died spiritually lost his divinity and reassumed it after the resurrection f we are gods these are heresies documentation will be provided re these teachings upon request zane or what does it do for you is it preventing you from going out and joining up with the word faith movement which you d been contemplating joining for so long but now that you ve read the book you ve been saved from all of that my reply it wasn t christianity in crisis that helped me it was a booklet by swaggart that i mentioned above but cic is much much better tremendous documentation and insights zane i don t have a nice scriptural answer for why i believe it is at best un profitable for christians to engage in this type of activity heresy hunting my reply why do you call it heresy hunting hunting implies it isn t readily accessible or available this movement is the fastest growing movement in christendom hagin has sold over million books and booklets hinn has sold more books in the last couple of years than swindoll and dobson combined fred price has the largest church in terms of seating capacity in the usa doesn t sound like much hunting is needed it is scriptural to expose doctrinal error i gave some verses to you before more can be given most of the epistles were written due to error doctrinal practical in the churches the early church had numerous councils to expose error and heresy it s not a new thing remember luther zane i would like to point out though that historically those who hunt heretics often end up causing a bigger mess than the heretics but this is my un documented opinion my reply if you can provide documentation it would be appreciated read ephesians esp vss and and tell me what causes disunity and immaturity in the body eph till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we should no longer be children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the trickery of men in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting disunity contrary to popular opinion isn t caused by exposing error it s caused by error zane there are many who probably give no place for seeing the scriptures as documenting a spiritual development or growth in its writers but i would suggest that the fiery paul of the letter to the galatians mellows and matures into the one who loses all for the sake of love in the end my reply most scholars believe paul wrote timothy last let s examine his admonitions to tim to ascertain how mellow he had become ti hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me in faith and love which are in christ jesus that good thing which was committed to you keep by the holy spirit who dwells in us this you know that all those in asia have turned away from me among whom are phygellus and hermogenes ti be diligent to present yourself approved to god a worker who does not need to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth but shun profane and idle babblings for they will increase to more ungodliness and their message will spread like cancer hymenaeus and philetus are of this sort who have strayed concerning the truth saying that the resurrection is already past and they overthrow the faith of some ti and a servant of the lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all able to teach patient in humility correcting those who are in opposition if god perhaps will grant them repentance so that they may know the truth and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil having been taken captive by him to do his will ti for of this sort are those who creep into households and make captives of gullible women loaded down with sins led away by various lusts always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now as jannes and jambres resisted moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt minds disapproved concerning the faith but they will progress no further for their folly will be manifest to all as theirs also was ti yes and all who desire to live godly in christ jesus will suffer persecution but evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of knowing from whom you have learned them and that from childhood you have known the holy scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in christ jesus all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be complete thoroughly equipped for every good work ti preach the word be ready in season and out of season convince rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and teaching for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but according to their own desires because they have itching ears they will heap up for themselves teachers and they will turn their ears away from the truth and be turned aside to fables but you be watchful in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist fulfill your ministry ti alexander the coppersmith did me much harm may the lord repay him according to his works you also must beware of him for he has greatly resisted our words zane the picture i have of paul is not of one who goes out of his way to destroy the ministry of wolves but of one who teaches the sheep with many tears the necessity of absolutely not allowing themselves to be transformed into wolves to protect themselves my reply act therefore i testify to you this day that i am innocent of the blood of all men for i have not shunned to declare to you the whole counsel of god therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock among which the holy spirit has made you overseers to shepherd the church of god which he purchased with his own blood for i know this that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you not sparing the flock also from among yourselves men will rise up speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after themselves therefore watch and remember that for three years i did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears zane for all the warning paul does it is of note that he never once drops a name of a wolf but i will admit he cries in his beard at the end over those who have abandoned him everyone in asia wasn t it my reply paul mentioned names ti this charge i commit to you son timothy according to the prophecies previously made concerning you that by them you may wage the good warfare having faith and a good conscience which some having rejected concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck of whom are hymenaeus and alexander whom i delivered to satan that they may learn not to blaspheme ti this you know that all those in asia have turned away from me among whom are phygellus and hermogenes ti but shun profane and idle babblings for they will increase to more ungodliness and their message will spread like cancer hymenaeus and philetus are of this sort who have strayed concerning the truth saying that the resurrection is already past and they overthrow the faith of some ti for demas has forsaken me having loved this present world and has departed for thessalonica crescens for galatia titus for dalmatia ti alexander the coppersmith did me much harm may the lord repay him according to his works you also must beware of him for he has greatly resisted our words so did john jo i wrote to the church but diotrephes who loves to have the preeminence among them does not receive us therefore if i come i will call to mind his deeds which he does prating against us with malicious words and not content with that he himself does not receive the brethren and forbids those who wish to putting them out of the church jesus also singled out teachings and doctrines rev but i have a few things against you because you have there those who hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balak to put a stumbling block before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit sexual immorality thus you also have those who hold the doctrine of the nicolaitans which thing i hate repent or else i will come to you quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth rev nevertheless i have a few things against you because you allow that woman jezebel who calls herself a prophetess to teach and seduce my servants to commit sexual immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols and i gave her time to repent of her sexual immorality and she did not repent indeed i will cast her into a sickbed and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation unless they repent of their deeds i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he who searches the minds and hearts and i will give to each one of you according to your works zane i question too the purposes of those who write books and build ministries on the faults deliberate or otherwise of others maybe if they would wander around in the desert eating locust and honey or barely cakes with no worldly goods at stake money to be made or no reputations to maintain i would question their motives conscious or otherwise less my reply i won t comment on this because it deals with the intangible motives of others but even if they had bad motives remember what paul said phi some indeed preach christ even from envy and strife and some also from good will the former preach christ from selfish ambition not sincerely supposing to add affliction to my chains but the latter out of love knowing that i am appointed for the defense of the gospel what then only that in every way whether in pretense or in truth christ is preached and in this i rejoice yes and will rejoice zane if we want to be true to the admonitions of scripture many of which you list about protecting ourselves and the flock from wolves and winds of doctrines i suggest we start by allowing the wolf program in our own noetic pasture to be nailed to the cross my reply please explain zane secondly i suggest any heresy hunting be restricted to our own fellowships which in the strict scriptural sense is the local city church my reply if heresy was not being propagated over the mass media then it may not be needed to go mass media with the exposure unfortunately heresy is being taught not just in copeland s church or hagin s or hinn s or price s but all over the radio in print etc no pastor or church leader knows what materials the sheep are feeding on outside the church it s imperative that leadership be made aware of this and cic does just that also let s examine a passage of scripture eph and he himself gave some to be apostles some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers eph for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry for the edifying of the body of christ these ministry gifts that the lord installs in the church are not just for one individual church but for the body of christ paul was an apostle he traveled all over distilling his message he was also a teacher co for this reason i have sent timothy to you who is my beloved and faithful son in the lord who will remind you of my ways in christ as i teach everywhere in every church co but as god has distributed to each one as the lord has called each one so let him walk and so i ordain in all the churches also co and god has appointed these in the church first apostles second prophets third teachers after that miracles then gifts of healings helps administrations varieties of tongues eph till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ notice that the five fold ministries are going to be around till the church is in unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to a perfect man this i believe will not occur fully until the lord jesus returns see cor but god wants the body to continue on maturing what hinders maturity and unity of the body eph that we should no longer be children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the trickery of men in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting it s clear that false doctrine integrated into the church by the trickery of men causes disunity the thing we are striving for and spiritual immaturity the church continues in spiritual childhood when christians are tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine the five fold ministry of which there does not appear to be clear scriptural denominational boundaries pastors appear responsible for their individual flock is to deal with these doctrines when necessary in their struggle to equip the body all believers are called to do this to a degree jud beloved while i was very diligent to write to you concerning our common salvation i found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints for certain men have crept in unnoticed who long ago were marked out for this condemnation ungodly men who turn the grace of our god into lewdness and deny the only lord god and our lord jesus christ zane if you ll notice in scripture the heresy hunters that went from church to church and area to area were the bad guys and they went after the good guy namely paul who they considered to be the arch heretic my reply they were themselves heretics trying to discredit paul who was preaching contrary to what they taught zane let s face it the wolves are here for a reason and we are here for the reason and let s hope the wolves become sheep and the sheep lambs my reply yes ti and a servant of the lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all able to teach patient in humility correcting those who are in opposition if god perhaps will grant them repentance so that they may know the truth and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil having been taken captive by him to do his will amen frank if one wished to contend with him he could not answer him one time out of a thousand job
christianity and holy things ezek god seems to be upset with the priests who have made no difference between the holy and the profane this brought to my mind a sermon i heard recently in which the speaker said god s second name does not begin with a d referring i believe to use of god s holy name and titles as swear words i was also reminded of the experience of moses at the burning bush when god told him take off your sandals for the place where you are standing is holy ground these and other texts seem to imply that god s people must treat holy things differently from other common things or make a difference between holy and common things the obvious questions are what makes something holy and how are christians primarily supposed to make this difference between holy and common things e g god s name the holy spirit the holy bible etc darius

re on capital punishment gt b prism gatech edu randal lee nicholas mandock writes regarding the new draft of the universal catechism in procuring the common good of society the need could arise that the aggressor be placed in the position where he cannot cause harm by virtue of this the right and obligation of public authorities to punish with proportionate penalties including the death penalty is acknowledged to the degree that means other than the death penalty and military operations are sufficient to keep the peace then these non violent provisions are to be preferred because they are more in proportion and in keeping with the final goal of protection of peace and human dignity exactly read that one sentence in there to the degree that means other than the death penalty and military operations are sufficient to keep the peace then these non violent provisions are to be preferred i don t believe that it is necessary for us to murder criminals to keep the peace the church in the united states feels the same way thus the reason that the catholic church has opposed every execution in this country in recent memory as is clearly shown by this excerpt the church s teaching on capital punishment remains today as it has always been in the past in total accord with my sentiment that i do not disagree with the use of deadly force in those cases for which this option is justifiable so what is justifiable as you stated very explicitly from the new catechism the only justifiable case is when it is necessary to keep the peace since that does not apply at all to this country the logical conclusion based on your own premises is that one must be opposed to any form of capital punishment in america just my opinions mike walker univ of illinois
re homosexual issues in christianity in article may athos rutgers edu mserv mozart cc iup edu mail server writes i can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues however a couple of them seem as though they do not require incredibly perverse interpretations in order to be seen as condemning homosexuality would someone care to comment on the fact that the above seems to say fornicators will not inherit the kingdom of god how does this apply to homosexuals i understand fornication to be sex outside of marriage is this an accurate definition is there any such thing as same sex marriage in the bible my understanding has always been that the new testament blesses sexual intercourse only between a husband and his wife i am however willing to listen to scriptural evidence to the contrary if we take things this literally then we must also forbid women from speaking in church paul while led by the holy spirit was human and could err i find it interesting that christ never discussed the issue of homosexuality certainly it existed back then and if it was a serious transgression christ would have condemned it i find it disturbing that the modern church spends its energy trying to stamp out something that christ didn t consider worth a single word of condemnation christ repeatedly warns us against judgement don t we risk judgement in equal measure when we condemn people who god himself did not judge when he walked on the earth the love of christ is contagious i should not that many of our readers do in fact advocate forbiding women from speaking in church this is an issue we have discussed in the past and i m not interested in redoing clh
re hate the sin scott prism gatech edu scott holt writes hate the sin but love the sinner i ve heard that quite a bit recently often in the context of discussions about christianity and homosexuality but the context really isn t that important my question is whether that statement is consistent with christianity i would think not hate begets more hate never love consider some sin i ll leave it unnamed since i don t want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not something is a sin now lets apply our hate the sin philosophy and see what happens if we truly hate the sin then the more we see it the stronger our hatred of it will become eventually this hate becomes so strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate the sinner in addition our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and that is an assumption on your part where is your proof that one always will degenerate into hating the sinner because he hates the sin i am reminded of the civil rights movement in america it is true that many individuals hated the proponents of racism it is also true that many individuals hated segregation and discrimination with their whole heart and never degenerated into hating the individuals who practiced it dr king s message was this love the individual the loving of the individual would transform him into a friend however this did not take away his hatred for segregation his hatred for injustice in the summary of the law christ commands us to love god and to love our neighbors he doesn t say anything about hate in fact if anything he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves so how are christians supposed to deal with the sin of others i suppose that there is only one way to deal with sin either in others or ourselves through prayer we need to ask god to help us with our own sin and to help those we love with theirs only love can conquer sin hatred has no place the best way to love someone is to pray for them i would ask did john the baptist practice love when he criticized the jewish leaders of his day did jesus practice love when he threw the moneychangers out of the temple we must have at least a distase for sin we must in order to fight it in ourselves also we must be ready for the call from god to call sin by its right name jesus loved everyone but he called sin by its right name it is true that love for others is to guide every step of our walk but it is also true that sometimes the love for god calls us to stand up for truth competition is the law of the jungle cooperation is the law of civilization eldridge cleaver sherman cox ii scox uahcs cs uah edu
re satan kicked out of heaven biblical someone asked about biblical support for the image of satan as a fallen angel rev and enoch have been cited clh there is also a verse in luke that says he jesus saw satan fall from heaven it s something like that i don t have my bible in front of me or i would quote it directly but it s a pretty obvious reference to satan s expulsion justin i believe the reference is to luke the context of the passage makes it possible that jesus is referring to satan being defeated by jesus mission rather than a previous fall from heaven clh
is this ethical the following was published in the may th rocky mountain news i guess i have some real ethical problems with the practices at this church i understand that baptism is an overriding factor i also understand that this is not an honest way to proceed unfortunately this is becoming more typical of congregations as the second coming is perceived to approach there is a real element of disparation in this make it happen at any cost style of theology i wonder where trust in the lord fits into this equation baptisms draw parents ire children at church carnival in springs told they d be killed by bee stings if they didn t submit to religious rite by dick foster rocky mountain news southern bureau colorado springs outraged parents say their children were lured to a church carnival and then baptixed without their permission by a baptist minister doxens of children some as young as years old and unaccompanied by their parents thought they were going to a carnival at the cornerstone baptist church where there would be a big water fight free balloons squirt guns and candy before that may carnival was over however children were whisked into a room for religious instruction and told they should be baptized in many cases they consented although they or their families are not of the baptist faith the baptisms by the church have angered many parents including paulette lamontagne a methodist and mother of twin year old girls who were baptized without her knowledge or consent my understnading was they were going to a carnival i feel that s a false pretense said lamontagne her daughters said the minister told them they would be killed by bee stings if they were not baptized cornerstone church officials defended their actions we take our instructions from the word of god and god has commanded us to baptize converts no one can show me one passage in the bible where it says that parental permission is required before a child is baptized said dan irwin associate pastor of the cornerstone baptist church church officials did not tell parents their children would be baptized because they didn t ask irwin said many other parents also felt they were simply sending their children to a carnival at the invitation of their children s friends who were members of the cornerstone church police said chhurch officials had broken on laws in baptizing the children but indicated the parents could pursue civil action aren t these the same behaviors we condemn in the hari krishnas and other cults i think the issues are more complex than the newspaper account mentions first i m not entirely sure that parental consent is absolutely required this would be extremely difficult because of the clear commandment to obey parents but if an older child insisted on being baptized without their parents consent i might be willing to do it however this would be a serious step and would warrant much careful discussion the problem i find here is not so much parental consent as that there was nobody s consent whether you believe in infant baptism or not baptism is supposed to be the sign of entry into a christian community if there isn t a commitment from somebody whether parent or child and no intent to become part of the church the baptism appears to be a lie furthermore it is likely to raise serious practical problems what if the child is from a baptist tradition normally when he reaches the age of decision he would be expected to make a decision and be baptized but he already has been by a church claiming to be a baptist church so does he get rebaptized neither answer is really very good if not he s being robbed of an experience that should be very significant to his faith clh
re hate the sin from scott prism gatech edu scott holt subject hate the sin date may gmt hate the sin but love the sinner i ve heard that quite a bit recently my question is whether that statement is consistent with christianity i would think not hate begets more hate never love if you are questioning whether or not hating sin is consistent with christianity i ask you to consider the following scripture romans let love be without hypocrisy hate what is evil cling to what is good what is it that paul through the inspiration of the holy spirit is calling us to hate would god call us to do something that would eventually lead to hating our fellow man especially when he commands us to do the opposite to love your fellow man consider some sin now lets apply our hate the sin philosophy and see what happens if we truly hate the sin then the more we see it the stronger our hatred of it will become eventually this hate becomes so strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate the sinner that has not been my experience i ve not found myself hating anybody as a result of hating the sin that may be in their life as a sinner myself i find myself having more compassion for the person jesus too since the bible teaches that he was tempted in every way that we are is able to have compassion on us when we our tempted and fall jesus is our very example of how to hate the sin but love the sinner in the account of the woman caught in adultery john jesus had compassion on the woman but he also called her to leave her life of sin this is what it means to love sinners but hate their sin it means loving them unconditionally while at the same time calling them to leave their sin in addition our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and do things which are taken personally by the sinner who often does not even believe what they are doing is a sin the blame for this can not always be laid at the feet of the christian i have seen and been guilty of taking offense by someone merely pointing out my sin and calling me to repent of it it was not unloving for the christian to call me out of sin in fact i believe it was the most loving thing that that person could have done he loved me enough to want to spare me the consequence of remaining in my sin after enough of this the sinner begins to hate us they certainly don t love us for our constant criticism of their behavior hate builds up and drives people away from god this certainly cannot be a good way to build love again i don t think that you can lay the blame for this at the feet of the christian if we have loved them as jesus loved sinners exemplified in john and the sinner hates us for it then we have done the best we can we will have extended to them the most perfect expression of love and they will have rejected it now it we hate the sin but forget to love the sinner then indeed we will ourselves be in sin in the summary of the law christ commands us to love god and to love our neighbors he doesn t say anything about hate i would like to encourage you to do a word study on hate in the new testament i really think that you will be surprised in fact if anything he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves criticism is very different from calling a sinner to repent hope this helps in christ tony balsamo name antonio l balsamo company digital equipment corp shrewsbury mass work e mail balsamo stargl enet dec com

eros in lxx concluding lexicographic note this might be better directed to s r c bible study which i have begun reading but since my earlier notes were posted to this forum i will conclude here as well a week ago i managed to find time to consult a septuagint concordance and a lxx text with apparatus at the library and i can now usefully conclude my look at the greek words for love as used in the christian background of the septuagintal translation of the jewish scriptures the principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal noun from erao eraste s meaning lover this cluster occurs just where one might most expect it in the propethic image and accusation of israel as faithless spouse to yhwh the verses in question are hosea jeremiah lamentations and ezekiel and hosea seems to have originated this usage which jeremiah and ezekiel picked up lamentations is dependent on though not likely written by jeremiah the erotic meaning in its allegorical use not at all literally is evident so too in english unless you complement it with a phrase like of the arts the word lover is going to have an overtone of sexual relationship there is no surprise here but it is worthwhile to see that standard greek usage does show up in the translations from the hebrew more interestingly and some confirmation of my guess that later koine usage avoided the verb erao because of its homonymy to ero say eromai ask there is an error in codex vaticanus normally a very valuable witness where a form of erao is used in a completely absurd context samuel where the meaning must be say in addition to the above and the uses i have already mentioned in proverbs esther uses the verb in its most natural application kai e rasthe ho basileus esthe r and the king loved esther and rather more interestingly samuel supplies a modest degree of support to the gay appraisal of the relationship of david and jonathan kai io nathan huios saoul e i reito ton dauid sphodra and jonathan saul s son loved david intensely i m using the bracketed i for io ta subscript which i don t yet have a reasonable ascii convention for the relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about the historical facts but just that a quasi official translation of the hebrew text in the hellenistic period makes no bones about using the erotic verb in this context given the quite general usage of agapao for erotic senses this need not mean anything more than agapao alone would mean but it does disambiguate the relationship as far as this translator goes michael l siemon i say you are gods sons of the mls panix com most high all of you nevertheless or you shall die like men and fall mls ulysses att com like any prince psalm
re earthquake prediction in article may athos rutgers edu dan ingres com a rose arose writes i believe with everything in my heart that on may the city of portland oregon in the country of the united states of america will be hit with a catastrophic and disastrous earthquake by now we know that this did not come to pass surprise surprise i sure didn t lose any sleep over it and i live there mistakes in this area are costly and dangerous for me my greatest fears in this area would be the following were god to call me to be a prophet and i were to misrepresent god s word my calling would be lost forever god s word would command the people never to listen to or fear my words as i would be a false prophet my bridges would be burnt forever perhaps i could repent and be saved but i could never again be a prophet of god suppose someone said that he was sure that he would return from death in glory and power flying in the clouds with the host of heaven soon within the lifetimes of those then standing with him and years went by without any such event he also asserted so they say himself to be god questions is that one of those false prophecies you were talking about does that make the speaker a false prophet speak directly if the lord has given you something to say say it but before i declare thus sayeth the lord i d better know for certain without a shadow of a doubt that i am in the correct spiritual condition and relationship with the lord to receive such a prophecy and be absolutely certain again without the tiniest shadow of a doubt that there is no possibility of my being misled by my own imaginations or by my hope of gaining recognition or of being misled by the wiles of the devil and his followers uhh has it occurred to you that there is no way to know any of these things for certain without the tiniest shadow of a doubt that people who thought they did have also been deluded those of us who believe in actually being able to check our opinions have an out we can check against some external reality those who assert that beliefs entertained without evidence or even despite evidence have a special virtue ie faith are out of luck and this is the result it s time that we christians give an example of honesty that stands out in contrast against this backdrop of falsehood when we say thus sayeth the lord it happens when we pray prayer is answered because we prayed right when we say we re christians we really mean it dan you want to demonstrate christian honesty great start with the prophecy above what can we conclude about the speaker max
re homosexuality issues in christianity darin johnson djohnson cs ucsd edu wrote ok what s more important to gay christians sex or christianity christianity i would hope would they be willing to forgo sex completely in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others to avoid the chance that their interpretation might be wrong etc if not why not heterosexuals abstain all the time it would be nice if protestant churches had celibate orders to show the world that sex is not the important thing in life the difference is that straight members are given the choice of abstaining or not and celibacy is recognized as a gift given only to some gays are told that as a condition of acceptance they must be celibate i don t believe that god gives me a forced choice between having a relationship with god and expressing my heterosexuality within the context of a faithful relationship nor do i believe that god gives that forced choice to gays sex or christianity is a false dichotomy to tell the truth gay churches remind me a lot of henry the viii starting the church of england in order to get a divorce or is this a myth note that i am not denying that gay christians are christian for my part gay churches remind me of blacks starting their own churches either because they were not allowed at all in the white churches or at best only with special restrictions that did not apply to white members revdak netcom com

re mormon temples dhammers pacific david hammerslag writes this paragraph brought to mind a question how do you mormons reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with christ s statement that in the ressurection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage luke chapt here is the short answer because only certain marriages are recorded in heaven now for the long answer in doctrine and covenants section the chapter discussing eternal marriage and yes plural marriage the distinction between sealings under the priesthood and other marriages is revealed when the children of this world marry or are given in marriage when they receive the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage luke jesus was simply teaching that marriages until death do you part are not in force after death however the doctrine and covenants continues describing eternal marriage d c and again verily i say unto you if a man marry a wife by my word which is my law and by the new and everlasting covenant and it is sealed unto them by the holy spirit of promise by him who is anointed this power and the keys of this priesthood shortened for brevity ai and shall be of full force when they are out of the world and they shall pass by the angels and the gods which are set there to their exhaltation and glory in all things as hath been sealed upon their heads which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever the lord told peter whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven matt do you doubt that peter was given the power to perform sealings peter thought so because he taught that husbands and wives were heirs together of the grace of life peter in order to obtain the highest degree of celestial glory a man must enter into this order of the priesthood d c when a man and wife are sealed they truly become one flesh because their eternal increase destinies are enjoined completely our father has an eternal companion and maybe more because of the plural marriage conditions of the law who participated in our creation and is equally concerned with our progress here there is no scriptural basis for this doctrine if fact the only mention of our mother is in one verse of a hymn written early in the history of the church o my father i had learned to call thee father through thy spirit from on high but until the key of knowledge was restored i knew not why in the heav ns are parents single no the thought makes reason stare truth is reason truth eternal tells me i ve a mother there why don t we hear more about our mother because our father presides under priesthood authority which is not a calling for her because we don t all necessarily have the same mother it would be confusing for worship because our father wishes to withhold her name and titles because of how some people degrade sacred things a idler
james and sirach on thursday may dave davis writes i m leaning sirach is more directly referenced by james than job or ruth is in any nt verse i ve seen it would help if you mentioned chapter and verse from sirach and from james job he taketh the wise in their craftiness seems to be quoted in corinthians james you have heard of the patience of job while not a quote implies that james and his listeners are familiar with a story of a man named job who exhibited exemplary patience it is possible that the story they know is not that found in the hebrew bible but rather another similar and related story one has the same problem with direct quotes again matthew boaz begat obed of ruth tells us that matthew knew a story about a woman named ruth who married a man called boaz and became the ancestor of david since ruth is not mentioned in the ot outside the book of ruth it seems likely that matthew was familiar with the book and respected it and thought ruth important enough to be one of the few women mentioned in the genealogy references like this do not prove that the nt writer considered his ot source inspired or inerrant or canonical but neither do direct quotes yours james kiefer
certainty of canonizations on friday may marty helgesen wrote public revelation which is the basis of catholic doctrine ended with the death of st john the last apostle nothing new can be added every so often the pope declares that some departed christian is now in heaven and may be invoked in the public rites of the church it is my understanding that roman catholics believe that such declarations by the pope are infallible i see three possibilities the church has received a public revelation since the death of for example joan of arc the church was given a list before the death of st john which had joan s name on it there is no public revelation about joan and roman catholics are free to doubt that she died in a state of grace or even that she is a historical character yours james kiefer
paul s thorn in the side joe moore writes paul repeatedly talks about the thorn in his side some think it refers to lust others pride but who knows whatever the thorn was apparently it was not compatible with christianity yet does that make his epistles any less paul mentions his thorn skolops actually a sharp stake in corinthians and to keep me from being too elated by the abundance of revelations a thorn was given me in the flesh a messenger of satan to harass me to keep me from being too elated three times i besought the lord about this that it should leave me but he said to me my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfectr in weakness he does not explain what it was but it need not have been a moral problem one guess is that paul had a disorder of the eyes he ordinarily dictated his letters and then added a personal note and his signature at the end of the letter to the galatians he says see i am writing in large letters with my own hand or else see what a long letter i have written with my own hand if the former translation is adopted it seems that paul could not write in the small script of a practiced writer but needed to make his letters larger and this suggests eye problems again he says to the galatians you know that it was because of a bodily ailment that i preached the gospel to you at first and although my condition was a trial to you you did not scorn or despise me but received me as an angel of god for i bear you witness that if possible you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me perhaps this last line means simply you would have done anything for me not withholding your most precious possessions your eyes but in that case we would expect some wording like if i had needed them if it were possible sounds as though the bodily ailment was connected with his eyes william barclay in his volume on acts makes a more specific suggestion before paul preached in the highlands of galatia he had been preaching in the coastal areas of asia minor if he had had a malarial attack while there a doctor would have advised him to leave the low country and head for the hills malaria might well have given him both severe headaches and blurred vision yours james kiefer

re mormon beliefs about children born out of wedlock in article may geneva rutgers edu aaronc athena mit edu aaron bryce cardenas writes bruce webster writes indeed lds doctrine goes one step further and in some cases holds parents responsible for their children s sins if they have failed to bring them up properly cf d c hi bruce how do you reconcile this practice with ezekiel ezekiel the soul who sins is the one who will die the son will not share the guilt of the father nor will the father share the guilt of the son the righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him actually in d c the parents are being held accountable for their own sins specifically they are accountable for their failure to teach their children properly if i fail to teach my children that stealing is wrong then i am responsible for their theft if they later indulge in such behavior this is very similar to the instructions ezekiel was given in eze if ezekiel failed to do his duty and warn the wicked not only would the wicked die in his sins but the lord would hold ezekiel responsible similarly parents are responsible to teach their children right from wrong i suspect most christians and jews etc would agree that parents have this responsibility

re dreams and out of body incidents ever since i was a kid and learned to tell when i was in a dream i have used my dreams for fantasies or working out problems in my dreams i have done everything from yell at my mom to machine gunning zombies not to mention myriad sexual fantasies i have deliberately done things that i would never do in real life i understand the need to control ones thoughts but i always felt that dreams were format free no morals no ethics no physical laws though sometimes i would have to wake myself up to go to the bathroom is this an incorrect attitude rather than weakening my inhibitions i could argue that i got certain things out of my system by experiencing them in dreams by analyzing a dream i can determine if i have a problem with a certain situation i e in a dream something will be exagerated that i can then contemplate and see if it really bothers me or not i can t believe that other people don t do the same it seems silly to attach moral significance to dreams i think that this is entirely different from out of body experiences which i have never had contradictions welcome chris mussack
reason and homophobia this has troubled me for a long time and needs to be dealt with from a long article available through an individual on this newsgroup about scripture being against homosexuality when we are less homophobic we will see that what we know as gay and lesbian people engaging in loving voluntary erotic relations with each other aren t even mentioned in the bible tk this frightens me not in the homophobic sense but intellectually especially because it was written by someone from a homosexual church so if my interpretation is different than theirs i am homophobic this can t be right disagreement in interpretation of the bible and or rejection of homosexual acts is not tantamount of homophobia ted kalivoda tedr athena cs uga edu university of georgia athens institute of higher ed
re more on peter in article may geneva rutgers edu jek cu nih gov writes in one sense no statement by another is subject to my private interpretation if reliable historians tell me that the athenians lost the pelopennesian war i cannot simply interpret this away because i wanted the athenians to win facts are facts and do not go away because i want them to be otherwise in another sense every statement is subject to private interpretation in that i have to depend on my brains and expereience to decide what it means and whether it is sufficiently well attested to merit my assent even if the statement occurs in an inspired writing i still have to decide using my own best judgement whether it is in fact inspired this is not arrogance it is just an inescapable fact yes there are these two senses of interpretation and certainly our decision to accept scripture as inspired ultimately rests on our own private opinion however when reading scripture we have to remember that the scriptures were given by god for our instruction and that the interpretation that matters is the one god intended for example if i decide that the fact that john the baptist is elijah teaches the doctrine of reincarnation i am wrong because that is not the intended interpretation the prophets didn t make up this teaching it came from god and we must accept it as such this necessarily means that our private interpretations must take a back seat to the meaning god intended to convey certainly we must rely on our best efforts to determine what this meaning is but this very fact should make us recognize that our private interpretations cannot be automatically accepted as the infallible interpretation of god we need to test the spirits to see if they are from god when the holy spirit speaks he says the same thing to all he won t tell me that a passage means one thing and tell you it means another if the two of us come to conflicting conclusions we can t both be completely right we know our interpretations are reliable only when the church as a whole agrees on what scripture means this is how we know the doctrines of the trinity the dual nature of christ etc infallibly these matters are not up for private interpretation this is the reason peter goes on to talk about the deceptiveness of the false teachers they preferred their own private interpretation to the god given teaching of the apostles it is through such private interpretation that the traditions of men so soundly denounced in scripture are started tony
homosexuality is immoral non religious argument this was crossposted to a zillion groups i don t intend to carry an entire discussion crossposted from alt sex particularly one whose motivation seems to be having a fun argument however i thought readers might be interested to know about the discussion there clh i intend to endeavor to make the argument that homosexuality is an immoral practice or lifestyle or whatever you call it i intend to show that there is a basis for a rational declaration of this statement i intend to also show that such a declaration can be made without there being a religious justification for morality in fact to show that such a standard can be made if one is an atheist anyone who wants to join in on the fun in taking the other side i e that they can make the claim that homosexuality is not immoral or that collaterally it is a morally valid practice is free to do so i think there are a lot of people who don t believe one can have a rational based morality without having a religion attached to it this should be fun to try and figure this out and i want to try and expose no pun intended my ideas and see other people s and see where their ideas are standing as i m not sure what groups would be interested in this discussion i will be posting an announcement of it to several and if someone thinks of appropriate groups let me know if someone on here doesn t receive alt sex let me know and i ll make an exception to my usual policy and set up a mailing list to automatically distribute it in digest format to anyone who wants to receive it as i ll use that as the main forum for this by exception to usual policy is that i normally charge for this but for the duration the service will be available at no charge to anyone who has an address reachable on internet or bitnet i decided to start this dialog when i realized there was a much larger audience on usenet internet than on the smaller bbs networks to give the other side time to work up to a screaming anger this will begin on monday may to give people who want to make the response time to identify themselves anonymous postings are acceptable since some people may not wish to identify themselves also if someone else wants to get in on my side they are free to do so this should be much more interesting than abortion debates
re homosexuality issues in christianity in article may geneva rutgers edu revdak netcom com d andrew kille writes of course the whole issue is one of discernment it may be that satan is trying to convince us that we know more than god or it may be that god is trying as god did with peter to teach us something we don t know that god shows no partiality but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him acts revdak netcom com fine but one of the points of this entire discussion is that we conservative reformed christians this could start an argument but isn t this idea that homosexuality is ok fairly new this century is there any support for this being a viable viewpoint before this century i don t know don t believe that homosexuality is acceptable to him so your scripture quotation doesn t work for us jeff adams
re christianity and repeated lives in article may athos rutgers edu u athmail cause way qub ac uk writes single angle brackets jesus is talking with the apostles and they ask him why the pharisees say that before the messiah can come elijah must first come jesus replies that elijah has come but they did not recognize him it then says that the apostles perceived that he was referi ng to john the baptist this seems to me to clearly imply reincarnation this was a popular belief in the judaism of jesus time that elijah would return again as he had been taken in to heaven in a chariot and did not actually die however jesus was referring to john the baptist not in the sense that elijah was reincarnated as john remember elijah didn t die but that john was a similar prophet to elijah there is no question of similarity in jesus indication about john the passage in matthew is very direct where luke reports the angel gabriel prophesying that john will go before christ in the power and spirit of elias in matthew jesus himself says of john and if you care to accept it he himself is elijah who was to come it is interesting that jesus prepended the words if you care to accept it as if to say that the implications of this truth namely of rein carnation i will not force on you but for those who can accept it here it is a jewish poster to other newsgroups on jewish esotericism and other topics has outlined the esoteric cabbalistic jewish teaching of of reincarnation and karma a teaching that is little known among jews today but which is apparently widespread enough in israel that hannah hurnard hinds feet on high places was told about it by a rabbi she was trying to convert back in the s as a missionary in palestine thus there may well have been a small number of jews who knew about this whereas the large number of people did not the statement of jesus about john the greatest human personality in the new testament is guarded but nevertheless quite direct again the subject of reincarnation one way or another is not a subject of the new testament nor is the fate in general of the human being between death and the last judgement but there are occasional indications that point to it as for the popular belief that elijah would come again it was more than a popular belief as jesus confirms it in more than one place and he never corrected those who were expecting elijah for example those who thought that jesus himself be he gerry palo compuserve com
re jacob and esau reincarnation in article may athos rutgers edu jek cu nih gov writes gerry palo wrote that there is nothing in christianity that excludes the theory of a succession of lives i wrote that the apostle paul in romans speaks of god as choosing jacob over esau and adds that this is not as a result of anything that either child had done since they had not been born yet clearly paul does not believe that they had had previous lives nor does he suppose that his readers will believe it for if they had had previous lives it would not make sense to say neither of them has done anything good or bad as yet since they are not yet born paul s statement only asserts that that particular choice was not a matter of karmic fulfillment of the past just as the fate of the man born blind john was not there is no question here of the simplistic idea of karma as a machine that is the sole determiner of one s destiny even the eastern traditions or many of them do not say that as one knowledgeable poster pointed out and if in fact that paul did not know about or believe in reincarnation does not say anything one way or another about it even john the baptist who jesus says emphatically is elijah matt does not appear to have been aware of it at least at the point at which he was asked but it is interesting that his threefold denial to the question whether he is the christ the prophet i e isaiah or elijah is emphatic in the first case and very weak in the third i would like to add once again that while it is important to discuss the different passages that may point directly to the teaching of repeated earth lives one way or another what i really see as important in our time is that the subject be revisited in terms of the larger view of christianity and christian doctrine for the most part those who do accept it either reject the central ideas of christianity or if they are christians hold their conviction as a kind of separate treasure i believe that christianity has important new understanding to bring to bear on it and vice versa much that is central to christianity takes on entirely new dimensions of meaning in light of repeated earth lives it has a direct bearing on many of the issues frequently discussed in this newsgroup in particular i have said openly that i have developed my views of repeated earth lives largely from the work of rudolf steiner not that i hold him as an authority but the whole picture of christianity becomes clearer in light of these ideas steiner indicated that the old consciousness of reincar nation necessarily had to fade away that it could be renewed in later times after a time of development of the christ idea through the first two millenia after christ s deed on golgotha in our own time it becomes important that having received the basic gospel of salvation our understanding of life and of the human being can now grow to embrace the significance of this idea for the discussions in this newsgroup i have tried to focus on that which can be related as directly as possible to scripture and to fundamental christian teaching and tradition gerry palo compuserve com

re hyslop and the two babylons in article may geneva rutgers edu mangoe cs umd edu charley wingate writes seeing as how the two babylons has been brought up again it is time for me to respond once again and say that this book is junk it is nothing more that an anti catholic tract of the sort published ever since the there were protestants its scholarship is phony and its assertions spurious i have not seen this book though i have had several people quote it in support of some tendentious assertions they were making so i have become curious about it i don t want to malign this hislop fellow whoever he may be as i have only heard the arguments at second hand but both of the arguments seemed to turn on false etymology that seemed to be derived from hislop i would be interested in knowing more about these things the first one claimed that the word church was derived from the greek cyclos and that it was therefore related to the worship of circe i don t know if hislop is the source of this assertion but it does seem to be based on false etymology the second claimed an etymological relationship between ishtar and easter which seemed to be even more fanciful and far fetched than some of the wilder notions of the british israelites regarding the latter as far as i have been able to find out easter is derived from the old english name for april eosturmonath the venerable bede mentioned that this was associated with a goddess called eostre but apart from that reference i have not been able to find out anything more about her it also seems that the term easter is only used by the english and those they evangelized the germans for example also use the term ostern but germany was evangelized by english missionaries so i would be interested in any evidence of easter being used for pascha by people who do not have any kind of connection with the ancient anglo saxons and their offshoots such evidence might support the claims of those who appear to derive the theory from hislop steve hayes department of missiology editorial department univ of south africa p o box pretoria south africa internet hayesstw risc unisa ac za fidonet steve hayes p f n z fidonet org faq missiology is the study of christian mission and is part of the faculty of theology at unisa

re homosexual issues in christianity michael michael siemon mls panix com writes michael the kind of interpretation i see as incredibly perverse is michael that applied to the story of sodom as if it were a blanket michael equation of homosexual behavior and rape since christians michael citing the bible in such a context should be presumed to have michael at least read the story it amounts to slander a charge michael that homosexuality rape to use that against us and michael it is just michael as wrong though slightly less incendiary so it s a michael secondary argument from the phobic contingent to equate michael homosexuality with such behavior as to equate it with the michael rape of god s messengers let s review the sodom and gomorrah story briefly it states clearly that the visitors were angels but all the men from every part of the city of sodom both young and old surrounded the house they called to lot where are the men who came to you tonight bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them for the rest of the story the angels are referred to by the men of sodom and by lot as men furthermore we know from gen that the lord had already found sodom guilty of grievous sin before the angels visited the city it is clear that the grievous sin of sodom and gomorrah involved homosexual sex it appears that the men had become so inflamed in their lust that they had group orgies in the public square which simply indicates the extremity of their depravity it does not show that lesser degrees of homosexuality are not sinful as michael would have us believe ultimately our understanding of god s will for sexuality comes from the creation story not solely on the story of sodom and gomorrah he created us male and female and instituted marriage as a relationship between one male and one female therefore a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife and they will become one flesh this marriage relationship is the only sexual relationship which god blesses and sanctions he regulates and protects the marriage of man and woman and even uses it as a picture of the relationship between himself and his church but we find not one word of blessing or regulation for a sexual relationship between two men or between two women everything else that we find in the bible about sexuality derives from or expresses god s will in instituting and blessing marriage thus the levitical code which was given only to the jews forbade incest homosexuality bestiality the ten commandments forbade adultery and the coveting of our neighbor s wife other commandments forbade rape the men of sodom and gomorrah were regarded as sexually immoral and perverse jude because they abandoned and or polluted the marriage relationship thus also paul regarded homosexuality as unnatural romans not because this was simply paul s opinion but because it was contrary to god s purpose in creating us male and female michael christians no doubt very sincere ones keep showing up here michael and in every corner of usenet and the world and all they michael ever do is spout these same old verses which they obviously michael have never thought about maybe never even read in total michael ignorance of the issues raised slandering us with the vilest michael charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can michael manage to conjure up tossing out red herrings with they michael suppose great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss michael our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what michael it is really have you no better response to slander than more slander david h wagner the day is surely drawing near a confessional lutheran when god s son the annointed shall with great majesty appear as judge of all appointed all mirth and laughter then shall cease when flames on flames will still increase as scripture truly teacheth es ist gewisslich an der zeit v bartholomaeus ringwaldt

re homosexuality issues in christianity in article may geneva rutgers edu noye midway uchicago edu writes i believe that the one important thing that those who wrote the old and new testament passages cited above did not know was that there is scientific evidence to support that homosexuality is at least partly inherent rather than completely learned note that scientific evidence in this area does not prove any conclusions there has been evidence to suggest that a certain part of homosexual s brains are different from heterosexuals but that proves very little also notice that the apostles did not have with them the scientific evidence linking certain genes with alcoholism or stealing with certain genetic problems even if they did have scientific evidence i doubt it would have stopped them from communicating the teaching from the holy spirit that these things are sinful this reminds me of a conversation with a professor of mine he said something very true christianity teaches that we should not give in to our every inclination most people do give in to their leanings in christianity we have the concept of struggling with the flesh and bringing it into submission one person may have a problem with his temper and having a murderous heart another may have a problem with homosexuality another may be inclined to greed but god offers us the opportunity to be more than conquerers sources where you can find this information there is homosexual behavior recorded among monkeys and other animals which is in itself suggestive that it is inherent rather than learned or at least that the word unnatural shouldn t really apply the preying mantis bites the head off of her mate after she mates with him is it natural for a woman to do the same thing to her husband the bible is concerned with human morality and only touches on animal morality as it relates to humans link hudson

re homosexual issues in christianity in article may geneva rutgers edu mls panix com michael siemon writes i notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse it is absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay christians do raise which concern sexual activity within committed consensual human adult realtionships so that your bringing it up is no more relevant than the laws of kashrut if you cannot address the actual issues you are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the world no it is very relevant homosexual acts and acts of beastiality are topically aranged together in the law this is very important anyone who would want to say that this command against homosexuality deals with temple prostitution and i think you would agree that there is no proof for this if the law reveals the character of god and is holy just and good as is written in the new testament then those who consider we who are against commiting homosexuals acts to be biggots have to address this passage of scripture why must we only discuss scriptures that involve consensual human adult relationships isn t that bordering on sophistry the point we are making is that god did not ordain certain kinds of sex acts not everyone who brings up these scriptures is just trying to use and emotional argument that compares homosexuals to beastophiles and child molestors the issue we are dealing with is that some sex acts are ungodly i do not have problem with a loving nonlustful relationship with a member of the same sex i have them and we all do the issue at hand is the sinfulness having sex with members of the same sex or lusting after so other forbidden sex acts are a valid topic for conversation and the idea that these relationships may be emotional relationships between adult humans is red herring we all agree that it is okay for adults to have caring relationships with one another link hudson

re homosexuality issues in christianity in may geneva rutgers edu djohnson cs ucsd edu darin johnson writes ok what s more important to gay christians sex or christianity i m afraid i see that question as very tendentious try rephrasing it what s more important to christians love of god or love of other human beings to which of course the only conceivable answer is that the one is like the other i am deeply suspicious of any flavor of christianity which would elevate one clause of the great commandment to a priority over the other such as to claim a conflict true we are told to let the dead bury the dead to hate family rather than let it keep us from following christ but the dichotomy here is not one between love of our fellows and love of god but of allowing social constructs to blind us to the presense of god it is particularly satanic to twist love of god in such a manner as to become an excuse to treat others as on a different level than the one who is so caught up in love of god the trouble comes in the relation of human love and human sex yes it has sometimes been the case that the church has taught that all sex was nasty evil sinful stuff but when man and wife leave their parental homes to become helpmates living in one flesh it is the sex that is the vehicle of becoming one flesh if you doubt me read st paul on what is wrong with frequenting prostitutes less provocatively what i mean is just this sexual bonding is a deeply founded aspect of our social interaction and in particular is the foundation of the institution of marriage so that unlike with many mammals human males remain with and foster the children they beget and support their children s mothers this is the schema behind genesis and behind jesus citation of that passage i observe by the way that not all human males in fact do as i have just described but another thing that characterizes human societies is our raising of non begotten children not only orphans and adoptees and the like but products of the quite common infidelities of humans to their spouses we are in this not unique in the animal world but the full extent of social consequences and implications is most intricate for us yes of course it sometimes goes wrong like all else we do it is infected with sin and you find married couples where there is no bond and people so deliriously addicted to the initial stages of sexual bond formation the infatuation falling in love phase that they break any forming bond in order to keep stepping over the threshold of the deep unity god has prepared for us and stepping back out again right away satan may indeed use sex as a very handy tool to corrupt human love but in the edenic creation that is not its nature and with god s grace under the power of christ to make all things new it need not be a problem for christians though we must be vigilant even in christ as the devil is watchful prowling around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour so returning to the original question what is more important to straight christians sex or christianity paul clearly tended to think that sex was at best a distraction from christianity though to be charitable to him his context was in expectation of immediate parousia so that the hard tasks of a married union the lifelong building and adaptation to each other seemed somehow to undercut the proper preparation for an immediate eschaton since we do not know the hour of return we should act both with instant readiness for that and with a commitiment to our mates that proposes a long lifetime together and telling people not to bond in such a perspective strikes me as crippling us in the second clause of the the commandment to love i would claim that only a very few saints have the capacity to deeply love without sexual tinges or complication mind you their fellow human beings unless they have had a deeply spiritual life in married union growing together as one flesh and that means in the type case with a persistent and continued sexual relationship we are human and little good comes of trying to mortify the flesh to the point of pretending to be otherwise pretending not to be sexual beings christianity i would hope would they be willing to forgo sex completely in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others it depends entirely on context if that context is major hypocrisy on the part of those who find us stumbling blocks i am much less of a mind to efface myself so that they can pontificate about my sins there are some people for whom a life of celibacy is a spritual gift and maybe even a victory against a to them troubling sexual urge that seems to them to lead only to sin nothing i say should ever be read as demeaning such a gift nor the even rarer gift of love for all our conspecifics and indeed for all god s creation that can develop to the full without the tutoring of a spousal helpmate marriage founded in sex but there is a difference between spiritual gifts and penance telling people that they have to have a particular gift or else what is fraught with manipulation and disregard of the differences of our spiritual endowments from god to one person is given the gift of speaking in toungues to another intepretation of toungues to yet another prophecy and to still another teaching the notion that some particular gift is required of all is one of the earliest heresies

re what was the immaculate conception ragraca vela acs oakland edu randy a graca writes consequently this verse indicates that she was without sin also as was observed at the very top of this post mary had to be free from sin in order to be the mother of jesus who was definitely without sin if the mother of jesus had to be without sin in order to give birth to god then why didn t mary s mother have to be without sin in order to give birth to the perfect vessel for jesus for that matter why didn t mary s grandmother have to be without sin either seems to me that with all the original sin flowing through each person the need for the last one mary to have none puts god in a box where we say that he couldn t have incarnated himself through a normal human being my god is an all powerful god who can do whatever suits his purpose this includes creating a solar system and planet earth with the appearance of great age providing a path through the red sea for the children of israel that does not depend on the existence of a ridge of high ground and a wind blowing at the right speed and direction and the birth of himself from a normal sinful person without being tainted by her original sin i see far too much focus on the objects of religion and not nearly enough on the personal relationship that is available to all believers with the author of our existence without the necessity of having this relationship channeled through conduits to god in the form of mary apostles and a pope note that the idea of mary being conceived without original sin i e the immaculate conception is distinct from the idea of mary not having sinned during her lifetime which is a separate doctrine and i believe also held by the catholic church if mary was born without original sin and didn t sin during her lifetime how is she any different from jesus this means the world has had two perfect humans one died to take away the sins of the world the other gave birth to him i would certainly want to see some scriptural support for this before i would start praying to anyone other than god everything i have ever read from the bible teaches me that jesus was and is the only sinless lamb of god not his mother grandmother hope this is useful to you very useful in helping me understand some of the rc beliefs thank you bill irwin the westrheim group vancouver bc canada uunet twg bill voice your computer bill twg bc ca fax systems partner
re eternal marriage hall vice ico tek com hal f lillywhite writes in article may athos rutgers edu dhammers pacific david hammerslag writes this paragraph brought to mind a question how do you mormons reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with christ s statement that in the ressurection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage luke chapt deletions i think what jesus is saying here and it is clearest in matthew s and mark s accounts is that marriages will not be performed in the resurrection this goes along with our belief that if a person is to marry at all it must be done on this earth deletions the problem with this view is that the topic under discussion in this passage is marriages that were performed on earth jesus words seem to me to indicate that he regards his response as the answer to their question about which earthly marriage would be valid after the resurrection this being the case the most straightforward interpretation in my opinion is that marriage does not exist in the next life because those who are raised are of a different nature than what we are now other wise why would jesus offer but are like the angels in heaven as a contrast to the idea of the resurrected marrying and being given in marriage we do not have angel like natures now but someday we shall and when we do our earthly marriages will be irrelevant or at least that s what i think jesus is saying about the post resurrection validity of marriages performed on earth your mileage may vary mark

re bernadette dates jek cu nih gov writes joe moore writes mary at that time appeared to a girl named bernadette at lourdes she referred to herself as the immaculate conception since a nine year old would have no way of knowing about the doctrine the apparition was deemed to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine bernadette was years old when she had her visions in four years after the dogma had been officially proclaimed by the pope yours james kiefer i forgot exactly what her age was but i remember clearly that she was born in a family of poverty and she did not have any education whatsoever at the age of the apparitions she suffered from asthma at that age and she and her family were living in an abandoned prison cell of some sort she had to ask the lady several times in her apparitions about what her name was since her confessor priest asked her to do so for several instances the priest did not get an answer since bernadette did not receive any one time after several apparitions passed the lady finally said i am the immaculate conception so bernadette was so happy and repeated these words over and over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the priest who was asking so when she told the priest the priest was shocked and asked bernadette do you know what you are talking about bernadette did not know what exactly it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for the priest the priest continued with how did you remember this if you do not know bernadette answered honestly that she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her way to the priest the priest knew about the dogma being four years old then but bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic personal revelation of our lady to bernadette note this lady of lourdes shrine has a spring of water which our lady requested bernadette to dig up herself with her bare hands in front of pilgrims at the start little water flowed but after several years there is more water flowing marida spreading god s words through actions mother teresa

re arsenokoitai nt meaning of conviction of sin a meta exegetical or methodological essay in article may athos rutgers edu rexlex fnal fnal gov writes i can t post it all at once so it will come piece meal and not daily i look forward to reading it when i got to the library last week it was with the object in view to look at some articles that have appeared over the last few years since my previous look at the literature un fortunately they had moved the journal back issues so i didn t get a look at the articles i was hoping to find i will continue to reserve my own judgment on arsenokoitai until i have seen the latest scholarly work and i can hope that rexlex s posting may give some meat to chew on however what i can do now is to point out the methodological issues what needs to be shown for anything to be concluded in this matter if the article rexlex posts addresses these issues so much the better if not you will perhaps understand why the problem is hard james b deyoung writes in abstractu this study argues that paul coined the term arsenokoitai deriving it from the lxx of lev cf and using it for homosexual orientation and behavior it is only a minor point but let me make it anyway de young has already contradicted his own prior assertion in this abstract that the ancient analysis of these issues was concerned with actions and not with orientation i doubt this will have much bearing on the article as such but thought i should point it out from the start the hypothesis de young is advancing is that paul a coined the word and b his intended meaning for it was in reference to the levitical law the questions i wish to raise are how would one go about confirming the truth of this hypothesis and what follows if one accepts or stipulates for the sake of the discussion that it is correct note that b is independent of a i consider b far more plausible than a which seems merely to be a counsel of despair over finding nothing in the literature contemporary with paul to clarify this word so far as i know paul does not in general invent words anywhere else in his letters unless you have an otherwise established pattern of coinages it is not sound methodology to assume it particularly if he gives no hint in the immedi ate text to fix the coinage s meaning for his audience as yet the extract presents no evidence at all what do we need to confirm or reject the hypothesis which i should say at the outset i find somewhat plausible i certainly know of nothing which makes it an impossible way of construing this problem passage i m going to set aside for the moment the question of whether paul might have coined this usage to look at the more tractable question of what it means for this there are in principle two kinds of evidence that can be adduced internal and external that is we can look at the text of paul s letter for clarification or look outside that to prior or contemporary writings that paul might have relied on or to derivative writings that have some claim of access to paul s meaning the single worst problem with this word in corinthians is that there is no internal evidence for paul s meaning he uses the word totally without an explanation or hint as to his meaning save that its inclusion in a list of negatives implies that it has for him some negative meaning we are left as the only internal clue with the etymology or formation of the word which is indeed the reason that de young and others before him have associated it with the leviticus prohibition of men verbing with other men where verb is some standard euphemism for having sex lie in leviticus bed in greek one problem is that bedders koitai is not as far as i know used that way in greek therefore i offer one serious test which de young s hypothesis must pass or be rejected o find a body of greek texts contemporary with paul or not much prior to his day such that the x koitai formation implies men who have sex with x obviously the best case is to find such usages of arsenokoitai itself such texts would be confirmation that the word can be read that way it is worth emphasizing that compound words are not in general under standable by projecting what the reader may imagine by the juxtaposition of the roots existence of such parallels doesn t prove the hypothesis correct but it goes a long way towards making such a usage whether or not original with paul in the specific case of x arse n possible of comprehension by his readers my test moves in the direction of external evidence if paul does not in his text explain his word and he does not then he has to expect his readers to already know the word which stands against its being a coinage or to expect that it mimics word formations that they do know such that they can guess his meaning without too much floundering external evidence that is texts other than paul s own and lexicographic or social historical considerations that might be adduced then come into the picture if there are other uses of the word not dependent on paul which have sufficient internal contextual evidence or some gloss by a contemporary scribe to show a derogatory reference to male homosexu ality or similar koitai formations used in similar ways then one has grounds for o denying that paul coined the word and o assuming that his readers might understand his meaning do you see the problem if paul coined the word then he requires his readers to share enough context with him to comprehend his coinage and its intent in this case that they would stipulating de young s guess understand him to be referring to the levitical universal prohibition of male male sex this mind you in a context where paul has emphasized at least to other congregations and so one assumes to the corinthians how else to explain cor and the corinthians having to be pulled back from overinterpreting their freedom the non applicability of torah law to his gentile converts among the considerations that make it implausible for paul to have coined the word its first element is archaic arse n is an old attic or ionic form of what in even classical let alone koine times would be assimilated as arre n to me this implies that we are even more than usually needful of external evidence to pin down meaning and usage what is paul doing inventing a word in obsolete attic formation and if he didn t coin the word but picked it up like the others in his list as common terms of derogation then his meaning will be for his readers constrained by that common meaning since he gives no other i cannot emphasize enough that paul does not tell us what he means by this word we and his original readers are guessing they at least had a contemporary context and maybe paul had used this very word and explained it in great detail to them in person but we have no trace of evidence of that and to suppose it is mere fantasy so we are desperately in need of external evidence about this word and it seems to be exceptionally meagre that is precisely the problem i can think of several more or less equally plausible hypotheses about the word a it was a standard gutter term of abuse for some or all maybe very specific maybe very general homosexual male activities b it was a term of abuse used by jews about the awful homosexual greeks which may or may not be consciously associated on their part with the leviticus passage c paul invented the term and again there may or may not be an association with leviticus in his doing so he may or may not intend the word to have an explicit and universal application with absolute and clear boundaries since none of his other words in that list have such character this last seems to me about the least plausible of the hypotheses i m advancing of these i d say off the top of my head that a is most plausible but i still have reservations about that too if the word never appears before paul and in later uses has some evidence of depending on paul then one can opt for paul s coining it if it does appear before him he might still have coined it being unaware of prior use in which case his coinage is inherently confusing but one should normally demote c on the basis of any earlier uses especially if they can be shown to have been at all common in the places paul traveled in either of the a or b cases one has to take into account paul s relation to the community of usage he picked the word up from and whether it be from the greek or jewish communities paul s relations are hardly straight forward there is so far as i have yet seen little or no external evidence to aid us in selecting one of these or some other hypothesis your guess is as good as mine or maybe worse or maybe better depending on a lot of things but it remains so far guesswork and i don t know about you but i for one will not equate human guesswork with the will of god by all means be convinced in your own conscience about what paul is getting at as he says elsewhere on what was in his day a major controversy of somewhat this same character romans hold on to your own belief as between yourself and god and consider the man fortunate who can make his decision without going against his conscience but anybody who eats in a state of doubt is condemned because he is not in good faith and every act done in bad faith is a sin for my part i cannot see any way to resolve paul s meaning in the use of arsenokoitai without directly applicable external evidence and by the nature of such external evidence it will never reach to certainty of constraining paul s own intent paul like humpty dumpty and me and all the rest of us will use words in ways that are personal choices and sometimes leave his readers puzzled if that puzzlement leads you to god it may be blessed if it should lead away as some of paul s words have led some people then paul s intense communicative effort to contrive his meaning in our souls may have some regretable consequences i have always found paul to be a fantastically reliable guide if i read him in the large if i can see him lay out his position in detail and hammer it home time and time again i am much less certain about his meaning in his many brief and cryptic passages such as this one in my usual discursive way i have gone on at great length about the first of my intended meta exegetical points what would be needed to confirm that paul a coined or b in any case meant the word to mean the same as the leviticus prohibition my second point is to stipulate this hypo thesis and follow up what it implies for both his initial readers and for

re homosexual issues in christianity mls panix com michael siemon writes in article may athos rutgers edu mserv mozart cc iup edu someone named mark writes do not be deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate nor homosexuals nor thieves nor the covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor swindlers shall inherit the kingdom of god and such were some of you i cor the moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of porneia in this i think we can all agree with paul that there are some kinds of activity that could be named by fornication or theft or coveting or reviling or drunkenness which would well deserve condemnation we may or may not agree to the bounds of those categories however and the very fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at all clear but that paul an excellent rhetorician had no interest in making them clear leaving matters rather to our spirit led decisions with all the uncomfortable living with other readings that has dominated christian discussion of all these areas what is fornication sex outside of marriage abuse of sex is not homosexual intercourse outside the context of marriage isn t it an unatural use of what god has given us why is it that homosexuals are using the grace of god as a license to practice sin for certain persons have crept in unnoticed those who were long beforehand marked out for this condemnation ungodly persons who turn the grace of our god into licentiousness and deny our only master and lord jesus christ jude nasb what is defined by god as a legitimate marriage for this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife and the shall become one flesh gen nasb and he answer and said have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife and the two shall become one flesh consequently they are no longer two but one flesh what therefore god has joined together let no man separate matt nasb but because of immoralities let each man have his own wife and let each woman have her own husband let the husband fulfill his duty to his wife and likewise also the wife to her husband corinthians nasb there are plenty of laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in leviticus most of which christians ignore completely they never even bother to examine them they just assume that they know which ones are moral and which ones are ritual well i have news for you any anthropology course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs unlcean as categories in an awful lot of societies we have them too but buried pretty deep and i cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of leviticus from the ritual law which no christian i know feels applies to us i disagree every law that is written in leviticus should be looked at as sin that is why we have a need for a savior i can understand someone who may not know a particular sin listed in the levitcal law but i would hope that they would repent when confronted with it i notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse well la ti da so what this is almost as slimey an argument as the one that homosexuality rape i know of no one who argues seriously though one can always find jokers in defense of bestiality it is absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay christians do raise which concern sexual activity within committed consensual human adult realtionships so that your bringing it up is no more relevant than the laws of kashrut if you cannot address the actual issues you are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the world if you want to address bestiality that is your business not mine and attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in our culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing us as human beings you want to dismiss us and use the sleaziest means you can think of to do so also i noticed that the preceeding verses say also you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness during her menstrual impurity and you shall not have intercourse with your neighbors wife to be defiled with her leviticus nasb these verses are just as relevant as you shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female it is an abomination leviticus nasb why was god telling the israelites not to practice such things do not defile yourselves by any of these things for by all these the nations which i am casting out before you have become defiled for the land has become defiled therefore i have visited its punishment upon it so the land has spewed out its inhabitants but as for you you are to keep my statutes and judgments and shall not do any of these abominations neither the native nor the alien who sojourns among you leviticus nasb he is the lord listen to what he has to say nobody wants to dismiss homosexuals we do love you but we don t agree that what you practice is not sin you have not truly repented of your sin we hate the sin that is within your lives i hate sin that is in my life all christians should hate the sin that is within their own lives confrontaion with sin should bring about repentance yes i agree with john but i also know that jesus said repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand matt if you don t agree that homosexuality is sin than how can you repent from it this means that you remain in bondage

sleeping with one s aunt the last time we discussed homosexuality i asked whether anyone could identify any other act besides homosexual intercourse that the bible prohibited but which might in some circumstances bring no apparent harm to anyone put another way the question is whether homosexual intercourse is the only act that christians are supposed to believe is immoral solely on the basis that god says it is with no insight being offered as to why it is immoral no one could answer my question in either form from the bible i did get an interesting response based on roman catholic theology however i think now that i can at least answer my first question link hudson pointed me to it in his recent comments about sleeping with one s aunt incest is held to be immoral in every society that is there are some degrees of relationship where marriage and thus intercouse is prohibited the bible is no exception the trouble is that it may be difficult to see why a particular relationship qualifies as incestuous societies differ as to how they define incest genetic reasons are sometimes offered but all the biblical cases cannot be dealt with that way why can t a man sleep with his step mother assuming that his father is dead and that he has married her how does this case differ from the duty to marry one s brother s childless wife are these two cases parallel does the bible prohibit some incestuous marriages and homosexual marriages for the same reason perhaps that god knows they are not good for us and yet we are incapable of understanding why p s please don t bother writing me to tell me that i am a homophobe as some did last time my mind is not made up on these questions you don t know whether i am homophobic or not you don t know me to call me or anyone else a homophobe without knowing the person may be as much an expression of bigotry as some homophobic remarks stan armstrong religious studies dept saint mary s university halifax n s armstrong husky stmarys ca att clyde watmath water dalcs armstrng
re question about hell in article may athos rutgers edu pwhite empros com peter white writes luke talks about the rich man and lazarus matthew talks about the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels revelations and reference this fire as the place where unbelievers are thrown matthew talks about being thrown into the eternal fire and the fire of hell it seems quite clear that there is this place where a fire burns forever from the revelations passages it is clear that the devil and his angels will be tormented there forever from the matthew passage it doesn t seem abundantly clear whether the punishment of unbelievers is everlasting in the sense of final or in the sense of continual you ve missed on very important passage thess for after all it is only just for god to repay with affliction those who afflict you and to give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire dealing out retribution to those who do not know god and to those who do not obey the gospel of our lord jesus and these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction away from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power when he comes to be glorified in his saints on that day and to be marveled at among all who have believed for our testimony to you was believed things to note from this passage unbelievers are both those who openly reject the gospel and those who do not know god the eternal destruction is the same as the eternal hope in this distructions primarily emphasize that it is separation from the presence of god the context is speaking of the nd advent while is speaking of the rapture don t confuse the two in the bible i am not aware of any discussion about the specifics of hell beyond the general of hot unpleasant and torment yet we have a far greater discription of hell that we do heaven for instance it is not discussed how if at all the rich man can continually stay in the fire and still feel discomfort or pain or whether there is some point at which the pain sensing ability is burned up if you can forgive the graphicalness if you throw a physical body into a fire assuming the person starts out alive at some fairly quick point the nerves are destroyed and pain is no longer sensed if this was like earthly fire that requires a gas producing substance to ignite however there seems to be a different type of fire as expressed in the burning bush that was not consumed also the daniel acct shows that the laws of nature can be interupted even with earthly fire it is not stated what occurs when at the judgement the unbelievers who are already physically dead are cast into hell maybe you don t understand there will be those who are alive at the end of the millenium who will walk straight into the gwtj even those who have died in their sin will be resurrected i e reunited with their physical body to receive condemnation i e they no longer have a physical body so they can t feel physical pain this is contrary to the teaching of scripture what could be sensed continually is that those in hell are to be forever without god the lazarus rich man parable is told with the idea of having the listener think in physical terms in order to get the point that some people won t listen to god even after he rises from the dead this is conjecture at best if you are using it to support the no physical body thesis the point of the parable is to reach the hard hearted here who are not listening to the fact of the resurrection nor the gospel about jesus christ it seems reasonable to also draw from the parable that hell is not even remotely pleasant the true awlfulness of hell is that it is eternal separation from god after having seen the glory of his presence at the gwtj but whether it was open rebellion against the revealed gospel of christ or if it is not having known god not saught him as he is then as paul says they are without excuss and that every mouth will be stopped there will be no defense at the judgment seat of god therefore we understand it is appointed unto man once to die and then comes judgment literally just because it is horrific doesn t make it less of a reality it should compel those of us who have the riches of christ to share it with others rex
re faq essay on homosexuality in article may athos rutgers edu hudson athena cs uga edu paul hudson jr writes i think we must be careful before we totally throw out leviticus if the law is reflection of god s character and true holy nature then those who say that god endorses homosexuality run into a problem though this will be addressed in the series of articles i m posting now under aresnokoitia i can t wait this just really blew my socks off read i tim verses speaks against those who have perverted the teachings of the mosaic law in vv we have in order the th thru the th commandments and in the midst of this listing is homosexuals the decalogue above everything else is seen as god s absolute if you don t believe in absolutes then you have nothing do do with jehovah of the ot which paul reveals to be the messiah of the nt lord christ jesus transliterates to read jehovah s anointed savior in i cor we see the same emphasis of moral separation from the pagan gentiles as we do in lev in i cor only one notation drunkards is not found in lev paul was not naive in his use of the lxx he knew full well how he was using the law of god that was given in the ot for application in the nt as i ve said the law was fulfilled not done away with of questions we are trying to deal with he encountered homosexuality only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was wrong he had never faced the experience of christians who try to act straight and fail and he had never faced christians who are trying to define a christian homosexuality which fits with general christian ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the relationship between god and man it is unfair to take paul s judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make judgements on these questions this understanding is thoroughly rebutted in deyoungs article that is being posted please refer to it one of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument is because paul probably did face this and other problems we can do better than probably which is not an adequate defense against the statement that paul s culture didn t have the same understanding of homosexuality as ours again read the article because it uses facts i claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual christians is not entirely a theological issue but also a pastoral one i don t see how you come to that conclusion i think i do because i have worked in the homosexual community by means of working with aids patients the pastoral is merely the practical application of the theological truth however those who are working thru the issue of homosexuality need to have our love and understanding just as with a friend who is contiplating cheating on his wife or a friend who lives with his girlfriend yet you continue to witness to him but once the choice is made and there is no remorse then i feel that paul s pastoral care as presented in the corinthian church come to bear significance the one in active rebellion should be placed outside of the church if a believer and if a non believer then one wipes his sandels and leaves it in gods hand if there was a member in your youth group who was constantly pawing at the little girls you wouldn t hesitate to deal with the matter quickly and decisivly that in part betrays the present political correctness of the issue pederasty is not accepted at the present but some how we are to accept homosexuality because the latter is politically correct while the former is not at least not yet this is how the morals decay i guess this would follow the liberal application in the political realm of economics the liberals want to tax the rich in the federal yet in their own states when they try to get businesses to settle there they give tax incentives to these same richies it comes down to a moral code of relativeness or to use the cultural thing politically correct at the moment rex you might want to look over tim again if this is really the th through th commandments we seem to be missing thieves and homosexuals would have to be fit in under adultery this is of course possible if arsenokoitia has a narrower meaning than homosexuality in general but i think that s not your thesis i have no objection per se to the idea that the author of tim might have quoted the commandments but through minus one and plus a few things begins to look a bit marginal clh
re question jesus alone oneness in article may athos rutgers edu jblanken ccat sas upenn edu james r blankenship writes jesus only and oneness tend to refer to groups that do deny the trinity they explain matthew by saying that jesus is the name of the father jesus is the name of the son and jesus is the name of the name of the holy spirit father son holy spirit referring to different roles all filled by jesus imho this are going from bad to worse in in was bad enough i do not like a god who prays to himself i refuse to believe jesus prayed to himself let s get real if the scriptures say he prayed to the father then the father is someone different than the son i have no problems with multiple gods to me the whole context of the scriptures says be perfect even as your father who is in heaven that we can be co heirs with christ that we will be like him co heirs share all things equally including knowledge power dominion etc when i am like him christ i will be the same as he is and he is a god if god cannot do this the his is not all powerful and he is not god if he will not he is a liar and he is not god but if he does he is the greatest of all the gods i don t know of anyone who says that jesus prayed to himself the whole point of the trinity is that there s enough of a distinction within god that relationship is possible this implies some sort of communication i assume that in their native form the father and son are directly enough connected that prayer in our sense isn t involved but jesus is the incarnation of the son i e the logos made flesh when he s in a human form his human actions are limited to human capabilities so communication with the father takes the form of prayer i don t see that there s anything problematical about that it seems to be implicit in the whole idea of incarnation clh

christian homosexuality part of note i am breaking this reply into parts due to length mls panix com michael siemon writes in article may athos rutgers edu mserv mozart cc iup edu someone named mark writes mls panix com michael siemon writes homosexual christians have indeed checked out these verses some of them are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations others simply do not address the issues i can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues there are exactly zero verses that clearly address the issues i agree that there are no verses that have gone unchallenged by gay rights activists but if there are zero verses that clearly address the issues doesn t that mean that there are also no verses that clearly support your case are you sure you want to say that there are zero verses that clearly address the issues however a couple of them seem as though they do not require incredibly perverse interpretations in order to be seen as condemning homosexuality the kind of interpretation i see as incredibly perverse is that applied to the story of sodom as if it were a blanket equation of homosexual behavior and rape since christians citing the bible in such a context should be presumed to have at least read the story it amounts to slander a charge that homosexuality rape to use that against us the story in genesis tells of the citizens of sodom demanding an opportunity to know the two men who were lot s guests the fact that the sodomites became angry when lot offered them his daughters could be seen as indicating that they were interested only in homosexual intercourse yes what they wanted was rape homosexual rape and everybody agrees that that is wrong some christians believe that the homosexual aspect of their desire was just as sinful as the rape aspect of their desire the passage does not say what it was that so offended god whether it was the homosexuality or the intended rape or both but i believe that it is only fair to consider all the possible alternatives in the light of related scriptures i do not believe that those who believe god was offended by both the homosexuality and the rape are trying to say that homosexuality is itself a form of rape you seems to take the view that the only sin described in gen is in the fact that the sodomites wanted to commit rape and that it is unfair to stigmatize their homosexuality by associating it with the sin of rape i can see how you might reach such a conclusion if you started from the conclusion that there is nothing wrong with homosexuality but then again we re not supposed to start from our conclusions because that s circular reasoning if god is in fact opposed to homosexual intercourse in general then the more probably interpretation is that he was at least as offended by the sodomites blatant homosexuality as he was by their intent to commit rape later on i will document why i believe the old testament portrays god as one who despises any homosexual intercourse even if both partners are consenting adults do not be deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate nor homosexuals nor thieves nor the covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor swindlers shall inherit the kingdom of god and such were some of you i cor the moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of porneia in this the moderator found my proposal to be circular in that he regarded the church as the proper authority for determining what kinds of marriages would be legitimate and thus the church s refusal to recognize perverted marriages was circular reasoning my questions however had nothing to do with the church ordaining new kinds of marriages and so his argument was something of a straw man in terms of my original question the precise definition translation of porneia isn t really important unless you are trying to argue that the bible doesn t really condemn extramarital sex i m not sure the moderator was trying to do that in any case i think both you and the moderator have missed the point here when jesus was asked about divorce he replied have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and the two shall become one flesh consequently they are no longer two but one flesh what therefore god has joined together let no man separate mt i read here that the sexual union of a man male and his wife female is a divinely ordained union in other words the institution of heterosexual marriage is something ordained and established by god not by men and not by the church but by god men are not supposed to dissolve this union in jesus words because it is not something created by men this is not circular reasoning this is just reading god s word i read in the bible that god ordained the union of male and female i do not read of any similar divinely ordained union of two males or two females granted there have been uninspired men who have ordained alternative unions isn t caligula reported to have married his horse but the only union that jesus refers to as what god has joined together is the heterosexual union of a man and his wife pardon me for mentioning caligula i know that s probably inflammatory and i should save it for the discussion on bestiality in part of this post please hold off on passing judgement on me until you have read that section of my reply anyway my original question was not whether we should translate porneia in a way that condemns only a select few kinds of extramarital sex my question was given that heterosexual marriage is the only union described by the bible as divinely ordained and given a biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage is homosexual intercourse sinful of course i see now that first we need to ask whether the bible really condemns sex outside of marriage you seem to be trying to argue that only certain kinds of extramarital sex and other sins are really wrong i think we can all agree with paul that there are some kinds of activity that could be named by fornication or theft or coveting or reviling or drunkenness which would well deserve condemnation we may or may not agree to the bounds of those categories however and the very fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at all clear but that paul an excellent rhetorician had no interest in making them clear leaving matters rather to our spirit led decisions with all the uncomfortable living with other readings that has dominated christian discussion of all these areas alternatively it may be that the definition of such terms as porneia and all the rest was in paul s day what we would call a faq i e the law as the tutor appointed by god to lead us to christ had just spent some sixteen centuries drumming into the heads of god s people the idea that things like homosexual intercourse were abominations that deserved punishment by death perhaps paul didn t go into detail on what porneia c were because after years he considered the question to have been dealt with already perhaps the reason god s apostles and prophets did not devote a great deal of time defining a distinct new testament sexuality was because he did not intend any significant changes in the sexuality he had already established by the law i ll discuss the law and homosexuality in greater detail below but i just wanted to point out that the new testament s failure to develop a detailed new standard of sexuality is not necessarily evidence that god does not care about sexual conduct especially after years of putting people to death for practicing homosexuality homosexual behavior is no different i and the other gay christians i know are adamant in condemning rape heterosexual or homosexual and child molestation heterosexual or homosexual and even the possibly harmless but obsessive kinds of sex heterosexual or homosexual that would stand condemned by paul in the very continuation of the chapter you cite may i mildly suggest that what paul does in his letter that you want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning i am free to do anything you say yes but not everything is for my good no doubt i am free to do anything but i for one will not let anything make free with me cor which is a restatement that we must have no other god before god a commandment neither i nor any other gay christian wishes to break some people are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior it is just as wrong though slightly less incendiary so it s a secondary argument from the phobic contingent to equate homosexuality with such behavior as to equate it with the rape of god s messengers and how do you define an obsessively driven mode of sexual behavior how do you determine the difference between obsessive sexual behavior and normal sex drives is the desire to have sinful sex an obsessively driven mode of behavior i think you see that this is circular reasoning why is it defined as sinful because it is obsessive what makes it obsessive the fact that the person is driven to seek it even though it s sinful or is it obsessive because it is a desire for that which society condemns once again that s circular why is it defined as obsessive because the person wants it even though society condemns it why does society condemn it because it is obsessive you seem to be trying to limit the bible s condemnation of porneia to only perverted sex acts but i don t think you can really define perverted without falling into exactly the same circularity you accuse me of what then is paul condemning when he declares that fornicators shall not enter the kindgom of heaven i won t deal with the exegesis of leviticus except very tangentially fundamentally you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your assumption that you know what porneia means i think you misunderstood me i was not trying to make an argument on some technical definition of porneia i was raising the issues of the sinfulness of extramarital sex and the lack of any scriptural evidence of a homosexual counterpart to the divinely ordained union of heterosexual couples there are plenty of laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in leviticus most of which christians ignore completely they never even bother to examine them they just assume that they know which ones are moral and which ones are ritual well i have news for you any anthropology course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs unlcean as categories in an awful lot of societies we have them too but buried pretty deep and i cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of leviticus from the ritual law which no christian i know feels applies to us i m dead serious here when people start going on as they do in this matter about how repulsive and unnatural our acts are and what do they know about it huh it is a solid clue to the same sort of arbitrary cultural inculcations as the american prejudice against eating insects please remember what you just said here for when we discuss bestiality in part on what basis other than assuming your conclusion can you say that the law against male male intercourse in leviticus is not a part of the ritual law i am glad you asked would you agree that if god condemns homosexual intercourse even among those who are not under the law of moses then this would show that god s condemnation of homosexual acts goes beyond the ritual law if i can show you from scripture that god punished the homosexual behavior of people who were not under the law of moses would you agree that god s definition of homosexual intercourse as an abomination is not limited to just the ritual law and those who are under the law i ve been having a private email discussion with a th day adventist on the subject of the sabbath and my main point against a christian sabbath keeping requirement has been that nowhere in scripture does god command gentiles to rest on the sabbath nor does he ever condemn gentiles for failing to rest on the sabbath this illustrates the difference between universal requirements such as thou shalt not kill and requirements that are merely part of the temporary jews only law of moses such as the sabbath the point you are trying to make is that you think the classification of homosexual intercourse as an abomination is just a part of the temporary jews only law of moses i on the other hand believe that it was labelled by god as an abomination for gentiles as well as jews and that he punished those guilty of this behavior by death or exile here s why back in genesis god promises to give abraham all the land that was then in the possession of the amorite kinda hard on the amorite don t you think but in verse we have a clue that this might not be as unjust as it sounds it seems god is going to postpone this takeover for quite a while because the iniquity of the amorite is not yet complete remember this is all long before there was a ritual law what then was the iniquity the amorite was committing that when complete would justify his being cast out of his own land and or killed go back and look at lev again verses list a variety of sins including child sacrifice incest homosexuality and bestiality beginning in verse god starts saying do not defile yourselves by any of these things for by all these things the nations which i am casting out before you have become defiled for the land has become defiled therefore i have visited its punishment upon it so the land has spewed out its inhabitants for whoever does any of these abominations those persons who do so shall be cut off from among their people notice that god says the gentile nations who are not under the ritual law of moses are about to be punished because they have defiled themselves and their land by committing abominations that include incest bestiality and homosexuality flip ahead two chapters to lev and you will find these same abominations listed and this time god decrees the death penalty on anyone involved in any of these things including specifically a man lying with another man as one lies with a woman lv their bloodguiltiness was upon them meaning that in god s eyes they deserved to die for having done such things according to lev even the alien non jew who sojourns among you was to refrain from these practices on penalty of being cut off by god from among their people under the circumstances i believe it would be very difficult to support the claim that in the old testament god objected only to the intended rape and not the homosexuality in sodom since god took the trouble to specifically list sex between two consenting men as one of the reasons for wiping out the canaanite nations not homosexual rape mind you but plain voluntary gay sex i d say god was not neutral on the subject of homosexual behavior even by those who had nothing to do with the mosaic covenant for those christians who do think that some parts of leviticus can be law for christians while others are not even to be thought about it is incumbent on you in every case handled on its own merits to determine why you pick one and ignore another according to ii tim all scripture is inspired by god and is profitable for teaching reproof correction and training in righteousness thus i believe that even though we gentile christians are not under the law we can learn from studying it if a certain action is defined as a sin because it is a violation of the law then it is a sin only for those who are under the law for example in the case of sabbath keeping where god reveals that certain actions are abominations even for those who are not under the law then i conclude that god s objection to the practice is not based on whether or not a person is under the law but on the sinfulness of the act itself in the case of homosexuality homosexual intercourse is defined by god as a defiling abomination for gentiles as well as jews i e for those who are not under the law as well as for those who are thus i am not at all trying to say that gentile christians have any obligation to keep any part of the law i am simply saying that god referred to homosexuality as a sin even for those who are not obligated to keep the law if this is so then i do not think we can appeal to our exemption from the law as valid grounds for legitimizing a practice god has declared a bloodguilty abomination that defiles both jew and gentile continued

christian homosexuality part of this is a continuation of an earlier post mls panix com michael siemon writes for those christians who do think that some parts of leviticus can be law for christians while others are not even to be thought about it is incumbent on you in every case handled on its own merits to determine why you pick one and ignore another i frankly think the whole effort misguided reread paul no doubt i am free to do anything but christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this the great commandment of love for god and neighbor if you cannot go through leviticus and decide each command there on that basis then your own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy in this context it is remarkably offensive to say i notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse i am sorry you found this offensive it was not my intent to offend i was leading up to another point which i discuss in more detail below well la ti da so what this is almost as slimey an argument as the one that homosexuality rape i know of no one who argues seriously though one can always find jokers in defense of bestiality it is absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay christians do raise which concern sexual activity within committed consensual human adult realtionships so that your bringing it up is no more relevant than the laws of kashrut if you cannot address the actual issues you are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the world if you want to address bestiality that is your business not mine and attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in our culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing us as human beings you want to dismiss us and use the sleaziest means you can think of to do so i can see you have a revulsion for bestiality that far exceeds my distaste for homosexuality certainly if i spoke about homosexuality the way you speak of bestiality nobody would have any trouble labelling me a homophobe let me ask this gently why are you so judgemental of other people s sexual preferences what happened to no doubt i am free to do anything i think you have a serious double standard here when you describe a comparison between homosexuality and bestiality as slimey and sleazy you are making an implicit judgement that bestiality is perverted sinful disgusting unnatural in short all the things that society once thought about homosexuality not all people share your view you claim not to know any sincere zoophiles but this does not mean that they do not exist they even have their own newsgroup alt sex bestiality are you going to accuse them all of being mere jokers i notice you deleted the main point of my comment the fact that the only biblical condemnations of bestiality occur in connection with the levitical prohibitions against homosexuality while there are some new testament passages that can arguably be taken as condemning homosexuality there are none that condemn bestiality one of your main points seems to be that christian homosexuality is acceptable due to the lack of any clear new testament statements against it if this is a valid argument then should not christian zoophilia be made that much more acceptable by the fact that the new testament makes no reference clear or unclear to the subject at all i am quite serious here if i am going to accept homosexuality as biblically acceptable on the basis of your arguments then i am going to be fair and apply the same standards to everyone else s declared sexual preferences as well if the arguments you make for homosexuality can be applied to other sexual preferences as well i m going to apply them and see what comes up i m not trying to torpedo a serious issue by using what you label a ridiculous joke i posted a question about how we should interpret biblical guidelines for christian sexuality and i don t think such a question is irrelevant in a group called soc religion christian the bible discusses homosexuality and bestiality together in the same context and therefore i feel i have a good precedent for doing the same jesus and paul both expound very explictly and in considerable length the central linch pin of christian moral thought we are required to love one another and all else depends on that gay and lesbian christ ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms and all we get in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side track the issues i don t know whether it makes any difference but for the record this is not a side issue for me i believe loving one another includes not encouraging people to defile themselves therefore it is of high importance to determine whether god regards certain sexual acts as defiling i can read in the new testament that god has joined together heterosexual couples and that the marriage bed is undefiled i can read in the old testament that homosexual intercourse and bestiality defile a person whether or not that person is under the law if gay christians can validly put aside the old testament standards of defilement then i want to know so that i can fairly apply it to all the sexual practices that defiled a person in the old days i don t think it s right to take just bits and pieces of the law and try and apply them to christians today e g bestiality still defiles you but homosexuality doesn t that was pretty much what you said earlier right you used different examples but i think you said essentially the same thing about it being wrong to apply only certain parts of the law to christians christians no doubt very sincere ones keep showing up here and in every corner of usenet and the world and all they ever do is spout these same old verses which they obviously have never thought about maybe never even read in total ignorance of the issues raised slandering us with the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can manage to conjure up tossing out red herrings with they suppose great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what it is it was not my intent to stir up such an emotional reaction i personally don t get all that upset discussing alternatives to the monogamous heterosexual orientation i m afraid i naively assumed that others would have a similar attitude please note that i have never intended to equate homosexuality with child abuse i have merely noted that for all the lack of clear nt condemnation of homosexuality there is an even greater lack of nt condemnation or even mention of bestiality a practice which a number of people e g on alt sex bestiality consider to be their true sexual orientation such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen truth in christ why for god s precious sake do you people quote irrelevant verses to condemn people you don t know and won t even take the trouble to listen to before you start your condemnations is that loving your neighbor god forbid is that how you obey the repeated commands to not judge or condemn others christ and paul spend orders of magnitude more time in insisting on this than the half dozen obscure words in paul that you are so bloody ready to take as license to do what god tells you not to do why for god s sake quote from john ff omitted for brevity this is an excellent question and i pray that you will not treat it as a mere rhetorical question but will genuinely seek to discover and understand the answer i recommend you begin with a little introspection into why you yourself have much the same attitude towards zoophilia why do you find bestiality so repugnant that you regard it as slanderous to even mention in connection with other alternative sexual orientations why do you not apply all the same verses about love and tolerance to zoophiles the way you apply them to homosexuals is it because you automatically experience a subjective feeling of revulsion at the thought a lot of people have the same experience at the thought of homosexual intercourse is it because you regard the practice as socially unacceptable a lot of people regard homosexuality as socially unacceptable do you feel that it violates the traditional judeo christian standard of sexual morality many people feel that homosexuality does do you feel the bible condemns it many people think the bible says more to condemn homosexuality than it does to condemn bestiality why then do you think comparing bestiality with homosexuality is insulting to homosexuality if you can honestly answer this question you will have come a long way towards understanding why many people feel the same way about homosexuality as you feel about bestiality also please note that i am not in any sense condemning people i am merely pointing out that when i read the bible i see certain sexual practices that the bible appears to condemn e g sex outside of marriage when i say i think adultery and pre marital sex are sinful do you take that as me failing to love my neighbor when you treat bestiality as something disgusting and unmentionable are you disobeying repeated orders not to judge or condemn others when you say other christians are guilty of sinning by condemning you and judging you are you by that accusation making yourself guilty of the same offense or are you and i both simply taking note about practices the bible brands as sinful and leaving the judgement of the people up to god for long ages we many of us have been confused by evil counsel from evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and rejected some of us despaired and took to courses that probably do show a sinful shunning of god s light blessed are those whose spirits have been crushed by the self righteous they shall be justified however we have seen the truth and the truth is the light of humanity and we now know that it is not we who fear the light but our enemies who fear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow it with the darkness of false witness against us michael l siemon i say you are gods sons of the mls panix com most high all of you nevertheless or you shall die like men and fall mls ulysses att com like any prince psalm i m not sure what you mean by the above two paragraphs if you mean that jesus is the truth and that he accepts sinners and does not reject them then i agree if we were not sinners then we would not need a savior our salvation in christ however does not mean that sin is now irrelevant for us and we can now do whatever we want nor does christ s grace mean that those who refer to sin as sin are being judgemental or intolerant i am speaking in general terms here not specifically about homosexuality if the bible calls something sin then it is not unreasonable for christians to call it sin too as applied to christian homosexuality i think the only definitive authority on christian sexuality is the bible if you make a list of everything the bible says on the subject of homosexual intercourse i think you will find that every verse on the list is negative and condemning at worst and unclear at best the most pro gay statement you could make about the list is that there is some dispute about the new testament verses which many people interpret as condemning homosexual intercourse that is from a gay perspective the most positive thing you can say about the bible s treatment of homosexuality is that some verses fail to clearly condemn it that s it jesus declared all foods clean the council at jerusalem declared that gentiles were not required to keep the ritual law but nobody ever reclassified homosexual intercourse from being an abomination deserving of death to being an accepted christian practice you have verses describing homosexual intercourse as an abomination that defiles both jews under the law and gentiles not under the law and you have some verses which are at best not clear but which some people believe are clear in their condemnation of homosexual behavior and that s the sum total of what the bible says about same sex intercourse i can appreciate from personal experience your desire to have everything simple cut and dried black and white what i want is ok and those who oppose me are wicked however i do not think the bible makes your case as definitively as you would like it to in fact i don t believe it says anything positive about your case at all yes i know the verses about loving one another and not judging one another but that s not really the issue is it you know and admit that there are still things that are sinful for christians to do since you say it is wrong for christians to condemn you therefore the issue is whether the bible says homosexual intercourse is a sin even if you do challenge the clarity of the new testament verses you are still left with the fact that the only thing the bible does say clearly about homosexual intercourse is that it is an abomination that defiles both those who are under the law and those who are not mark actually i don t think the reaction to the comparision with bestiality is based on bestialophobia i think what he regards as slimey is the rhetorical approach of connecting homosexuality and bestiality most people who accept homosexuality take a radical approach to the law they regard all of lev as not binding on christians the argument is that there s no way in the text to separate bestiality homosexuality and wearing mixed fabrics this does not mean that such people have no limits on their conduct nor does it mean that they accept bestiality it simply means that their sexual ethics does not come from the law and particularly not from lev clh

re incarnation two minds of christ in article may geneva rutgers edu tedr athena cs uga edu ted kalivoda writes nabil wrote both families agree that he who wills and acts is always the one hypostasis of the logos incarnate marhaba nabil if we posit two minds in christ the mind of the logos and the mind of the human jesus then we must admit two wills a mind is not a mind without a will i know this has been dealt with in past church prnouncements but there is a philosophical problem here that should examined t v morris argued that the incarnation can be seen like this mind of logos here the mind of jesus is circumsribed by god the human son god the son has complete access to the human mind mind but the human mind only has access to the mind of god the son when the son allows access this explains why jesus said even he did not know the time of the kingdom the ideas of a completely healthy version of split personality from the field of psychology and the intriguing ideas of being in a dream seeing yourself acting knowing that is you but also being omniscient i ve explained it here before if you want the full document ask me by mail rex questions arise as we begin to think about logos and what his inner consciousness was composed of we need to clarify the two natures of christ briefly the divine nature which has existed eternally did not undertake any essential changes during the incarnation which would cause a conflict with the attributes of god the foremost of these being his immutability this would mean that it remained impassable that is incapable of suffering and death free from ignorance and insusceptible to weakness and temptation in the realm of the divine nature it is better to say that the son of god became that which was not absolute and in himself the result of the incarnation was that the divine logos could be ignorant and weak could be tempted and suffer and die not in his divine nature but by the derivation of his possession of a human nature this would mean that both the properties of the divine nature and the human nature are properties of the person and therefore ascribed to the person by this reason we can say that the person can be omnipotent omniscient and omnipresent yet at the same time be also a man of limited power knowledge a man of sorrows subject to human wants and miseries there is however no penetration of one nature into the other deity can no more share the imperfections of humanity than humanity can share in the essential perfection of the godhead we are not to assume that there is a double personality due to the possession of the double natures christ s human nature is impersonal in that it attains self consciousness and self determination in the personality of the god man we must now differentiate between the person and the nature of the man nature is defined the distinguishing qualities or properties of something the fundamental character disposition or temperament of a living being innate and unchangeable nature is then in essence the substance possessed in common in as such the trinity have one nature there is also a common nature of mankind personality on the other hand is the separate subsistence of nature with the power of consciousness and will it is for this reason that the human nature of christ has not nor ever had a separate subsistence that it is impersonal logos the god man represents the principle of personality it is equally important to see that self consciousness and self determination do not as such belong to the nature it is for this reason that we can justifiably say that jesus did not have two consciousness or two wills but rather one it is theanthropic an activity of the one personality which unites in itself the human and the divine natures being that neither the consciousness nor the will are simply human or simply divine the quotation given above is not identified and it s not entirely clear to me what position loren is taking on it just for clarity let me note that the view expressed in it is one of the classic christological heresies monothelitism that s the position that christ s two natures were not complete in that there was only one will in most cases which i think includes this example it was the human will that was regarded as missing normally people who talk about christ s human nature as being impersonal mean it in a somewhat more abstract sense that is they are using person as hypostatis not in the usual english sense of personality in this use the doctrine is called anhypostasia personally i think anhypostasia is just a more sophisticated way of denying that the logos took on humanity fully however it has never been formally ruled a heresy and in fact has been held by influential theologians both ancient and modern e g athanasius but the quotation above appears to be going farther than even athanasius went into the realm of the overtly heretical clh
arsenokoitai scroggs cont dr james deyoung r scroggs robin scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and suggested a new twist to the word scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a hellenistic jewish coinage perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic terminology the term is derived from lev where the lxx juxtaposes the two words arsenos male and koiten bed and represents the hebrew miskab zabar lying with a male yet he believes that paul did not originate the term but borrowed it from circles of hellenistic jews acquainted with rabbinic discussions n it was invented to avoid contact with the usual greek terminology if this is true scroggs observes it explains why the word does not appear in greco roman discussions of pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it it was meaningless to native speaking greeks scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the object of the second part thus differing from boswell s learned discussion yet scroggs understands the general meaning of one who lies with a male to have a very narrow reference with the preceding malokoi i cor which scroggs interprets as the effeminate call boy arsenokoitai is the active partner who keeps the malakos of the mistress or who hires him on occasion to satisfy his sexual desires hence arsenokoitai does not refer to homosexuality in general to female homosexuality or to the generic model of pederasty it certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model he affirms this is scrogg s interpretation of the term in i tim also the combination of pornoi fornicators arsenokoitai and andrapodistai slave dealers refers to male prostitutes males who lie with them and slave dealers who procure them it again refers to that specific form of pederasty which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual purposes and the use of these boys by adult males even serious minded pagan authors condemned this form of pederasty he then uses these instances of arsenokoitai in i cor and i tim to interpret the apparently general condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in rom consequently paul must have had could only have had pederasty in mind we cannot know what paul would have said about the contemporary model of adult adult mutuality in same sex relation ships in relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical concerns scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of vices in i cor have no deliberate intended meaning in paul the form and function of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped any relationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually nonexistent he concludes that paul does not care about any specific item in the lists both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary phenomenon of a catalogue of vices scroggs argues that the scriptures are irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today the model in today s christian homosexual community is so different from the model attacked by the nt that biblical judgments against homosexuality are not relevant to today s debate they should no longer be used in denominational discussions about homosexuality should in no way be a weapon to justify refusal of ordination reactions to the new interpretations of arsenokoitai d wright in more recent years the positions of bailey boswell and scroggs have come under closer scrutiny perhaps the most critical evaluation of boswell s view is that by david wright in his thorough article wright points out several shortcomings of boswell s treatment of arsenokoitai he faults boswell for failing to cite or citing inaccurately all the references to lev and in the church fathers such as eusebius the apostolic constitutions clement of alexandria tertullian and origen boswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term derives either its form or its meaning from the leviticus passages this is significant for if the term is so derived it clearly refutes boswell s claim that the first half of the word arseno denotes not the object but the gender of the second half koitai the lxx must mean a male who sleeps with a male making arseno the object wright also faults boswell s claims regarding linguistic features of the term including suggested parallels though boswell claims that compounds with arseno employ it objectively and those with arreno employ it as an adjective wright believes that the difference between the two is merely one of dialectical diversity no semantic import attaches to the difference between the two forms wright believes that in most compounds in which the second half is a verb or has a verbal force the first half denotes its object and where the second part is substantival the first half denotes its gender it is with boswell s treatment of the early church fathers that wright takes special issue because the former has failed to cite all the sources for example aristides apology c ad probably uses arrenomaneis androbaten and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male homosexuality contrary to boswell s discussion boswell fails to cite hippolytus refut omn haer and improperly cites eusebius and the syriac writer bardensanes the latter uses syriac terms that are identical to the syriac of i cor and i tim next wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in parallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers the dominant form of male homosexuality among the greeks sometimes this parallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia adultery porneia fornication and paidophthoria with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris clement of alexandria in protr cites the second table of the ten commandments as you shall not kill ou moicheuseis you shall not commit adultery ou paidophthoreseis you shall not practice homosexuality with boys you shall not steal n another occurrence of arsenokoitein commit homosexuality exists in the sibylline oracles it may be wright observes that the word was coined by a jewish pre christian writer in a hellenistic setting represented by or sib book wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in rhetorius th c who drew upon the first century ad writer teucer in macarius th th c and in john the faster d the last in particular bears the idea of homosexual intercourse contrary to boswell wright next replies to boswell s contention that the term would not be absent from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to the first century ad since it did not exist before then that the greeks used dozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality that some sources e g didache show no acquaintance with paul s letters or deliberately avoid citing scripture and that boswell neglects citing several church fathers boswell s treatment of chrysostom in particular draws wright s attention boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of chrysostom omitting references and asserting what is patently untrue chrysostom gives a long uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on rom boswell has exaggerated chrysostom s infrequent use of the term wright observes that boswell has signally failed to demonstrate any us of arsenokoites etc in which it patently does not denote male homosexual activity it is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature and the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly specified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the greco roman world wright also surveys the latin syriac and coptic translations of i tim and i cor all three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning homosexual i e they understand arseno as the object of the second half of the word none of these primary versions supports boswell s limited conclusion based on them wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the catalogues of vices as a literary form he believes that such lists developed in late judaism as hellenistic jews wrote in clear condemnation of homosexuality in the greek world this paralleled the increased concern on the part of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence the term came into being under the influence of the lxx so that writers spoke generally of male activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual engagement with paides if arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were interchangeable it is because the former encompassed the latter in summary wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning homosexuality and arises with judaism the views of boswell scroggs and others who limit the term to active male prostitutes or pederasty are without significant support from linguistic and historical studies next the questioning of wrights position by william peterson after that we get into the good stuff of historical linguistic studies this will include symposium by plato if there is any doubt as to the modern understanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of paul this will certainly clear things up also we will review paul s use of lev in the nt and how as for him the law was fulfilled but not done away with lev was the universal and the following chapters the general those who put forth that the ot no longer holds true today in our culture should stick around for this one r scroggs the new testament and homosexuality phil independently we came to the same conclusion apparently the connection is made in e a sophocles greek lexicon of the roman byzantine periods from bc to ad see discussion he says the same thing about paul s language in rom but this is doubtful see the more cautious words of p zaas i cor ff was homosexuality condoned in the corinthian church sblasp he observes that the words moixai malakoi and arsenokoitai were part of jewish anti gentile polemic yet paul s wors at the end of the vice list and such were some of you indicate that paul is addressing real or potential abuses of his ethical message not citing primitive tradition by rote wright disputes zaas attempt to associate the term with idolatry on boswell s treatment of rom the article by r b hays relations natural and unnatural a response to john boswell s exegesis of romans jre spring is an excellent critique d f wright homosexuals or prostitutes the meaning of arsenokoitai i cor i tim vc in an unpublished paper henry mendell arsenokoitai boswell on paul effectively refutres boswell s claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai he finds the meaning to be general a male who has sex with a male wright s endnotes list additional sources in the church fathers we also have noticed the same tendency by boswell to fail to cite all the references to sodom and sodomy in the apocrypha and pseudepigrapha see j b deyoung a critique of prohomosexual interpretations of the ot apocrypha and pseudepigrapha bsac in light of the claim made by boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai points to a meaning lacking homosexual significance wright asks pertinently why neither philo nor josephus use paidofthoria nor josephus paiderastia and why clement did not use the latter and chrysostom the former n in a more recent article homosexuality the relevance of the bible evq wright reiterates these same points paul shows a remarkable originality in extending the ot ethic to the church

mary blessed among women dave bernard writes when elizabeth greeted mary with the words blessed art thou among women luke it appears that this places mary beyond the sanctification of normal humanity but deborah says judges blessed among women shall be jael the wife of heber the kenite blessed above all women in the tents it can doubtless be taken that jael s slaying of sisera was a type of mary s victory over sin but even if we take deborah s words as applying prophetically or symbolically to mary they must still be applicable literally to jael we may well take them to mean that god used her as a part of his plan for the deliverance of his people and that she has this in common with mary but we have no reason to suppose that they mean that she was sinless and thus no reason to take the like expression applied to mary as proof that she was sinless yours james kiefer

re arsenokoitai nt meaning of meta exegesis conviction of sin part ii let me return to the question stipulating that paul meant his use of arseonkoitai to refer more or less exactly to the levitical prohibition of male male sex in order to bring out the problems most clearly i ll also stipulate what i think is far less plausible that paul coined the term for this usage the question i want to turn to is what that would mean for paul s readers and for later christians this should be shorter than my last note as we will see that this question rapidly confronts us with some of the major divisions within christ s body and i am not trying to open the gates for flames across any of the terrible chasms that separate any of us from our fellow christians my own biases loosely characterizable as liberal will be evident but i am not grinding an axe here so much as trying to get all parties to see that it may be hard to reach closure when the issues involved strike at the heart of what we each in our own different ways see as crucial to the gospel of christ so stipulating paul s intent the immediate question is how can his readers understand this intent and following on that question there is a second one what is our proper action if we do manage to understand him since paul gives not a single clue about his meaning in the text of st corinthians there are two positive answers and one negative to this question a paul or apollos or someone in the apostolic community has conveyed to the corinthians the then traditional jewish condem nation of homosexual behavior and paul expects them to be sufficiently well tutored by this tradition that he needs no futher explanation i should note that there is no evidence in the letter or in corinthians for such a supposition b the spirit will teach us what paul means or if not paul what god means behind paul s inspired word choice c we don t know and cannot guess to within any better pre cision here than for comparison in the parallel use by paul in the same passage of the word pleonektai those who have more if you think that areseonkoitai is obvious from its roots try cutting your teeth on this word the neb translates it as grabbers or even methusoi drunkards at least this has the advantage of being a common insult so that at least there is some hint as to its meaning the three positions more or less if i can be allowed some exaggeration for the sake of argument define a classical catholic attitude towards tradition one form of protestant sola scriptura and a liberal critical demand for evidence all three positions have strengths and weaknesses ad a it is unquestionable that the gospel was preached in and by the community of christ s disciples and their successors and that our nt scripture itself emerges from this communal tradition but it s also the case that we know little or nothing about this tradition until almost a century after paul which is to say that we have access to the tradition only after several generations of possibly confused transmission the scripture is itself our only documentation of the tradition in the critical era ad b if we are not born of water and spirit to revert to john in an attempt to explain paul then we have no more hope of under standing the gospel than nicodemus had neither the traditions of men nor the vain elevation of our own reason can prevent the spirit from blowing where it will the paraclete is a kamikaze but the downside of protestant belief in the efficacy of the spirit as our guide in scripture is that the wing of protestantism that takes this most seriously is also the most fragmented over divergent understanding supposedly derived from the clear word of god note classical lutheran calvinist and anglican thought constrains scripture to be read within tradition even while reserving judgment against tradition out of scripture the more bizarre forms of i will read scripture my way are primarily a fringe aspect of cultic protestantism the main problem with this approach is that there is apparently no means for one person to convey to another what that one may feel is teaching received from the spirit and history shows incredible conflict between christians on this point each in his own mind convinced that he is led by the spirit no one can seriously urge point b without some sense of its potential for setting christian against christian to what purpose ad c the critical approach has the distinct advantage that when it can reach a conclusion it can lay out the data in a way which is open to all the weakness is an obvious corollary this is not usually possible if i may say a word here out of my own already acknowledged bias one complaint against critical methodology is that it dissolves faith but surely a faith that cannot honestly face the evalu ation of evidence has problems which mere theology is helpless to address anyway there is a serious and unfortunate possibility of schism between liberal and conservative positions mostly on the basis of extreme zealots of positions b and c a catholic sense of authority and tradition tends to constrain arguments of b contra c to secondary position so that despite horrendous strains rome is not as likely to find these issues as ultimately divisive as the protestant world will and anglicans will i predict muddle through on the via media attempting to give each position its due but no more than its due second question suppose tradition tells us and lots of spiritual christians tell us and critical thought at least admits as possible that paul is refering to a flat universal levitical prohibition against male male sex what then again we can abdicate our personal responsi bility to tradition and let it dictate the answer but it s precisely where inherited traditions are not questioned that they re most dangerous we have examples of christ questioning the pharisees and their use of tradition despite his urging in matthew that we are to heed them we have examples of peter and more radically still paul jettisoning the traditions that they were led by the spirit to call into question jesus and peter and paul do not so much throw out tradition as subject it to radical criticism on a couple of very basic grounds the weightier demands of the law justice and mercy and good faith matthew and on these two commandments love god neighbor hand the whole law and the prophets also matthew if there is a fundamental because derived from christ validity in the challenge to some traditions a validity that led the first generation to go so far as to waive application of the torah to gentile converts vastly beyond anything that is directly deducible from jesus reported words and deeds it signifies to me a certain failure of the imagination to postulate that only the traditions that we have specific challenges against are in fact open to challenge all traditions passed through men are traditions of men that god may lead us even so that these traditions are a source of our spiritual instruction i will freely grant but tradition is inherently human and inherently corruptible and given the fall corrupt nothing in it is immune to challenge when the spirit shows us a failure in justice mercy and good faith nothing may ultimately stand unless it does follow from love of god and love of neighbor i am perfectly willing to grant that i could be blind to my own sin that the spirit may have taught another what she refuses to teach me or i am too dense to learn that tradition might have value here but what i know of tradition is that on one occasion some superstitious christians appealed to justinian after an earthquake in asia minor and scapegoated sodomites as the cause of the earthquake so that legislation was passed making homosexual behavior a capital offense if that is in accord with the gospel of christ then i am no christian that is human tradition at its most hateful and vicious and i see nothing all that much different in all the unbidden eruptions onto usenet of people who are quick to condemn but slow to understand if that is the leading of the spirit then i want no part of it but what i have found in obedience to the lord is that i am myself totally dependent on the witness of other christians for the truth that lives in the body of christ and i say to all who doubt that gay christianity is from god what gamaliel said to doubting pharisees who would have suppressed the earliest church be careful how you deal with these people if this enterprise this movement of theirs is of human origin it will break up of its own accord but if it does in fact come from god you will not only be unable to destroy them but you might find yourselves fighting against god acts all i ask is that you listen to your traditions and read your scriptures with a mind and soul open to the spirit and to the past history of our first christian witnesses willingness to challenge tradition and other readings of scripture though read with all the authority of scribes and rabbis and a submission to the declaration that all must depend on the love of god and neighbor then study the evidence learn the history of christians oppressing christians out of their traditions and eagerness to judge where jesus and paul tell us not to judge and let the witness of the spirit in the lives of your fellow christians including those who are not of your preference in theology guide you towards god s truth michael l siemon i say you are gods sons of the mls panix com most high all of you nevertheless or you shall die like men and fall mls ulysses att com like any prince psalm there s a certain ambiguity in your discussion of position a as to whether you re speaking of tradition in paul s time or ours i think there are two ways to use tradition one is to say that when paul and his readers share a tradition it makes sense to interpret his words in the context of that shared tradition that s what makes me think that these arguments over words turn out to be silly we know that paul came out of a background that was rather puritanical on sex everything else he says on sex is consistent with that background the tone of his remarks on homosexuality in rom is consistent with that background even if the words in the sin lists aren t the most general terms for homosexual activity and it seems to me that there s some evidence that they are not they are just one more piece of evidence for something we would probably be willing to believe with no evidence at all that paul shares the common jewish rejection of homosexuality but when you identify a with the catholic position that s rather a horse of a different color the catholic position involves a continuing church tradition arguments specific to that tradition might be we can get guidance on how to interpret paul s original meaning from tradition e g the way the church fathers interpreted him and we gain confidence that his prohibitions still apply in our time because of the universal judgement of the church between his time and ours i think this is a somewhat different use of tradition a radical protestant might be willing to use known st cent tradition to illuminate paul s original meaning but not use the catholic position to answer the question of what our own attitude to homosexuality should be clh

re portland earthquake bill rea cctr cantua canterbury ac nz wrote his theology clashed with the theology of the local prophets it was out of a very deep understanding of the mosaic covenant and an actute awareness of international events that jeremiah spoke his prophesies the judgement prophesies were deeply loaded with theological meaning in my opinion both the portland earthquake prophesy and the david wilkerson new york will burn prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic theological depths of the jeremiah prophesies perhaps one other thing i should have added is that jeremiah s prophesies about the coming destruction of jerusalem would have been understood by the people of that time to be a full frontal assault on their understanding of their relationship with the lord today the if the general populace hears prophesies like the portland earthquake or new york will burn ones they are unlikely to see it in the context of their relationship or lack of it with the lord they are far more likely to think that they are just the result of the fevered imaginations of a religious nutter that is one reason why i am always deep y suspicious of bald judgement prophesies without any explanation of the reasons for the judgement this doesn t have to be long winded to see a relatively modern example look at abraham lincoln s second inaugural speech the relevant section is below it is this type of spiritual insight which was missing in both prophesies posted here excerpt from abraham lincoln s nd inaugural speech both read the same bible and pray to the same god and each invokes his aid against the other it may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just god s assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men s faces but let us judge not that we be not judged the prayers of both could not he answered that of neither has been answered fully the almighty has his own purposes woe unto the world because of offences for it must needs be that offences come but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh if we shall suppose that american slavery is one of those offences which in the provdence of god must needs come but which having continued through his appointed time he now wills to remove and that he gives to both north and south this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offence came shall we discern therein an departure from those divine attribute which the believers in a living god always ascribe to him fondly do we hope fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away yet if god wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bond man s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword as was said three thousand years ago so still it must be said the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nation s wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and a lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations bill rea o o w u w bill rea computer services centre e mail b rea csc canterbury ac nz university of canterbury or cctr csc canterbury ac nz christchurch new zealand phone fax

pastortalk pastortalk a weekly dialogue with a local pastor on the news of the day by carl gene wilkes startext mc compuserve internet compuserve com this week s thoughts last week the supreme court refused without comment to hear an appeal by rensselaer in school officials desiring the distribution of bibles in their public schools rel a lower court had banned the local gideons an international bible distribution group from passing out bibles to fifth graders the aclu s barry lynn was quoted as saying that the court s action protected the religious neutrality of our public schools he also said that schools must serve students of all faiths and none schools were not to be a bazaar where rival religious groups compete for converts according to lynn several gideons men who are responsible for putting bibles in hospitals and hotels are members of our church they tell of similar stories where they are only allowed to distribute bibles on sidewalks around the schools but cannot go inside the schools they tell of mild harassment by parents who do not want their children receiving a bible from a stranger they are willing to continue their work at a distance but find the school s position somewhat disheartening i understand rationally and logically the court s position and i can see the sense of fairness for all groups but on the other hand when does neutrality become nihilism when does plurality turn into no position at all i see a couple of ironies here one is that we can pass out condoms but not bibles in our schools think on that one for a moment the other is that while we are seeking religious neutrality in our schools countries like russia who by the way practiced religious neutrality for the past seventy years are making the bible part of their public school curriculum when i was in st petersburg in march the church we worked with had trained over public school teachers to teach the bible and the government had requested hundreds more i recently heard a medical doctor who is president of the gideon chapter in moscow tell how they are eagerly invited to the university of moscow to distribute bibles to the students and are given class time to explain its contents i remember seeing a photograph of this doctor holding a bible and speaking to the university students standing under a statue of lenin now that s ironic i admit two things we are a pluralistic society and all faiths have equal footing this is what our country was founded on to allow every group on school grounds could create a bazaar like atmosphere each city must work to be inclusive of all religions and provide a hearing for them i know i said two the vitality of religious faith is not dependent upon whether or not the public arena acknowledges it as valid however and you knew this was coming i believe disallowing the distribution of the bible by law abiding caring adults in our schools only signals once again our culture s movement away from a singular base from which we as individuals and as a nation can make moral and ethical decisions what do you think mail box let me know if you do not want me to print your letter or your name good column re time coverstory about teen sexuality i agree with moral education from home but some homes don t have the kinds of morals i want taught one family i worked with smoked dope as their primary family activity another acted like incest was ok families no matter where they are are often a lot sicker than we d like to believe from john hightower mc john i agree that the home ain t what it used to be and some homes are not the place to learn value based sexuality i still believe that this is where the church can come into play i know those families you speak of may not come to a church to seek information but the help does not need to be in a church building i believe that the youth from the families you mentioned will probably disregard the value free information at school too writer s note the views of this column do not necessarily reflect the views of members of or the church legacy drive baptist church plano tx
what do we feel i see a parallel between what i will stupidly call the homosexual issue and the atheist issue please take no offense at these comparisons the homosexual feels things that i admit i do not feel he learns that these feelings are classified as homosexual feelings and learns of a model of sexuality that seems to apply to his feelings which he then can fit with his experiences that is this model gives him a sense of understanding his situation models that do not match up with what he knows he feels will be discarded however one wonders if once accepting the idea of his being gay and deciding what exactly that means he will analyze all his feelings and experiences based on the definition he has already accepted which of course validates his model if that was hard to understand now listen to my parallel the christian feels things that an atheist claims he does not feel the christian accepts the christian theology as the true description of what his feelings mean once accepting this model he interprets his experiences with regards to this model which of course validates his christianity as a reminder i am a christian a catholic i don t hate homosexuals or atheists but am just trying to understand them i only compare them because they are both so foreign to me am i as blind to the homosexual as the atheist seems blind to me or am i as prejudiced against atheistic denial of religious experience as the homosexual is prejudiced against attempts by society to deny his sexuality or am i just out to lunch again chris mussack

re homosexuality issues in christiani he is hoping to pass a resolution that more or less states that we the members of the church agree to disagree on the issue admitting that both sides have honestly studied the scriptures and had the spirit lead them to different conclusions it worked last year when the abortion issue threatened to do more or less the same thing and he is hopeful that the ga can foster a loving and caring attitude about people who disagree with their own view cliff slaughterbeck people would not be willing to note that the church was not willing to live with this kind of compromise with ordination of women the one thing that will definitely prevent a person from becoming a presbyterian minister is if they indicate that they don t accept ordination of women the argument is that we can t have half the church not accepting the leaders of the other half maybe people will clh it might be interesting for folk to know that the church of scotland also a presbyterian church managed to agree to disagree over women s ordination for years the reasoning was that congregations are free to call whoever they wish and that ministers and sessions choose elders if a congregation did not wish to have a woman they were not obliged to and if a session did not wish to they could not be forced to note that the who issue of freedom to call on the part of the congregation is very important here this year is the th annivarsary of the disruption where the church split on that very issue they didn t get back together for almost years a couple of years ago on the anniversary of the allowing of womens ordination the position was changed so that in theory all ministers and elders must recognise that women can be ordained in theory a minister who refused to ordain a woman to his session or refused to work with a woman minister in presbytery could be disciplined in practice this has not happened and i believe it is unlikely to happen my personal view is that the new legislation was a mistake and that the permissive but not prescriptive legislation worked very well we are going to start going round the homosexual debate at next years assembly at this years a motion was put to ban the blessing of same sex couples after an edinburgh minister did so our panel on doctrine is currently looking at marriage and will report next year the matter will be considered and debated then hope this is interesting alison

re baptism requires faith in article jhpb sarto budd lake nj us joseph h buehler writes catholics view the effects of baptism slightly differently and that s one primary reason why they baptize babies they believe that baptism produces a change in the soul of the baby quite independently of any volitional act on the part of the baby this change in the baby s soul gives the infant certain capabilities that he would not have without baptism since the infant does not have the use of his intellect and will yet these new faculties are dormant but as the child gets older the gifts of baptism come more and more into play i guess i would react rather strongly to this line of thinking carried out when you think your army is stronger than mine you would righteously take my children and baptize them doing what you know is really best for them you cannot possibly put this kind of action nor the crusades into the context of the teachings of jesus god i think he advocated a different approach that was by design made to be appealing to those called by him not chosen by a church practice it seems to me you have the cause and effect switched the change comes and then you get baptized answer not a fool according to his folly lest thou also be like unto him answer a fool according to his folly lest he be wise in his own conceit proverbs
arsenokoitai continuing part i think used by permission the source and nt meaning of arsenokoitai with implications for christian ethics and ministry james b deyoung w petersen more recently wright s understanding has itself been questioned from a different direction in a brief study william petersen found linguistic confusion in using the english word homosexuals as the meaning of arsenokoitai he faulted wright and english bible translaions for rendering it by homosexuals in i cor and i tim in a sense petersen has coalesced bailey boswell and scroggs into a single assertion that reiterates in effect the position of bailey he finds homosexuals unacceptable as a translation because it is anachronistic a major disjunction exists between contemporary thought and terminology and the thought and terminolgy in paul s time what is this disjunction he bases it on historical and linguistic facts accordingly ancient greek and roman society treated male sexuality as polyvalent and characterized a person sexually only by his sexual acts virtually all forms of behavior except transvestism were acceptable christianity simply added the categories of natural and unnatural in describing these actions ancient society know nothing of the categories of homosexuals and heterosexuals and assumed that in the words of dover quoted approvingly by petersen everyone responds at different times to both homosexual and to heterosexual stimuli in contrast to this modern usage virtually limits the term homosexual to desire and propensity k m benkert who in coined the german term equivalent to homosexual used it as referring to orientation impluse or affectional preference and having nothing to do with sexual acts petersen then proceeds to cite the supplement to the oxford english dictionary which defines homosexual only as a propensity or desire with no mention of acts petersen s point is that by using homosexuals for arsenokoitai one wrongfully reads a modern concept back into early history where no equivalent concept existed consequently the translation is inaccurate because it includes celibate homophiles incorrectly exludes heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts and incorrectly includes female homosexuals prior to there was no cognitive structure either inour society or in antiquity within which the modern bifurcation of humanity into homosexuals and hetersosexuals made sence the foregoing clarifies why petersen feels that the translatio homosexual is mistaken yet is it possible that petersen is the one mistaken on both historical and linguistic or philological grounds the next phases of this paper will critically examine petersen s position the justification for translating arsenokoitai by homosexuals historical grounds a refutation of the foregoing opposition to the traslation of arsenokoitai by homosexuals begins with the historical and cultural evidence since virtually everyone acknowledges that the word does not appear before paul s usage no historical settings earlier than his are available yet much writing reveals that ancient understanding of homosexuality prior to and contemporary with paul the goal is to discover wheither the ancient s conceived of homosexuality particularly homosexual orientation in a way similar to present day concepts peterson bailey boswell and scroggs claim that the homosexual condition desire propensity or inversion whatever it is called cannot be part of the definition of the term they assert this either because the term is limited to acts of particular kind boswell active male prostitutes scroggs pederasty or because the homosexual condition was unknown in ancient times bailey petersen the following discussion will show why neither of these positions is legitimate attention will be devoted to the latter postion first with the former one being addressed below under linguistic grounds in regard to the latter position one may rightfully ask did not the homosexual condition exist before is it only a modern phenomenon yet if it is universal as alleged today it must have existed always including ancient times even though there is lack of sophistication in discussing it indeed evidence show that the ancients pre christian and christian not only knew about the total spectrum of sexual behavior including all forms of same sex activity transvestism included but also knoew about same sex orientation or condition petersen admits n that plato in symposium d d may be a sole possible exception to ancient ingnorance of this condition he discounts this however believing that even here acts appear to be the deciding factor however this is a very significant exception hardly worthy of being called an exception because of the following additional evidence for a homosexual condition the symposium of plato gives some of the strongest evidence for knowledge about the homosexual condition plato posits a third sex comprised of a maile female androgynon man woman hence original nature palai physis consisted of three kinds of human beings zeus sliced these human beings in half to weaken them so that they would not be a threat to the gods consequently each person seeks his or her other half either one of the opposite sex or one of the same sex plato then quotes aristophances each of us then is but a tally of a man since every one shows like a flatfish the traces of having been sliced in two and each is ever searching for the tally that will fit him all the men who are sections of that composite sex that at first was called man woman are woman courters our adulterers are mostly descended from that sex whence likewise are derived our mancourting women and adulteresses all the women who are sections of the woman have no great fancy for men they are incllined rather to women and of this stock are the she minions men who are sections of the male pursue the masculine and so long as their boyhood lasts they show themselves to be sliced of the male by making griends with men and delighting to lie with them and to be clasped in men s embrasces these are the finest boys and striplings for they have the most manly nature some say they are shameless creatures but falsely for their behavior is due not to shamelessness but to daring manliness and virility since they are quick to welcome their like sure evidence of this is the fact that on reaching maturity these alone prove in a public career to be men so when they come to man s estate they are boy lovers and have no natural interest in wiving and getting children but only do these things under stress of custom they are quite contented to live together unwedded all their days a man of this sort is at any rate born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man eagerly greeting his own kind well when one of them whether he be a boy lover or a lover of any other sort happens on his own particular half the two of them are wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love and are hardly to be induced to leave each other s side for a single moment these are they who continue together throughout life though they could not even say what they would have of one another d c should these two persons be offered the opportunity to be fused together for as long as they live or even in hades aristophanes says that each would unreservedly deem that he had been offered just what he was yearning for all the time e several observations about this text are in order lesbianism is contemplated as will as male homosexuality e natural interest ton noun physei b refelects modern concepts of propensity or inclination the words born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man paiderastes te kai philerastes gignetai b reflect the modern claims to be born this i e as homosexual the idea of mutuallity the two of them are wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love b is present aristophanes even speaks of mutual love ingrained in mankind reassembling our early estate ho eros emphytos allelon tois anthropois kai tes archaias physeos synagogeus d the concept of permanency these are they who continue together throughout life c is also present further mention of and or allusion to permanecy mutality gay pride pederasty homophobia motive desire passion and the nature of love and its works is recognizable clearly the ancients thought of love homosexual or other apart from actions the speakers in the symposium argue that motive in homosexuality is crucial money office influence etc bring reproach e a b they mention the need to love the soul not the body e there are tow kinds of love in the body b and each has its desire and passion b d the speakers discuss the principles or matters of love c the desires of love c and being males by nature c noteworthy is the speech of socrates who devotes much attention to explaining how desire is related to love and its objects a c desire is felt for what is not provided or present for something they have not or are not or lack this is the object of desire and love socrates clearly distinguishes between what sort of being is love and the works of love e this ancient philosopher could think of both realms seaual acts as well as disposition of being or nature his wors have significance for more than pederasty in summary virtually every element in the modern discussion of love and homosexuality is anticipated in the symposium of plato petersen is in error when he claims that the ancients could only think of homosexual acts not inclination or orientation widespread evidence to the contray supports the latter biblical support for homosexuality inclination in the contexts where homosexual acts are discribed adds to the case for the ancient distinction in rom such phrases as reasoning heart becoming foolish desires of the heart and reprobate mind prove paul s concern for disposition and inclination along with the doing or working of evil also see vv even the catologues of vices are introdiced i tim or concluded i cor by words describing what people are or were not what they do habits betray what people are within as also the lord jesus taught cf matt the inner condition is as important as the outer act one gives rise to the other cf mt petersen errs regarding other particulars too transvestism apparently was accepted by the ancients it was practiced among canaaniteds syrian people of asia minor as well as greeks according to s r driver only a few moralist and jewish writers are on record as condemning it for example seneca moral epistles condemns homosexual exploitation that forces an adult slave to dress be beardless and behave as a woman philo also goes to some length to describe the homosexuals of his day and their dressing as women the special laws iii see also his on the virtues where he justifies prohibition of cross dressing even the ot forbade the interchange of clothing between the sexes deut petersen is also wrong in attributing to christianity the creating of the new labels of natural and unnatural for sexual behavior these did not begin with paul rom but go as far back as ancient greece and even non christian contemporaries used them plato the test naph philo josephu plutarch and others used these words or related concepts linguistic grounds footnotes w l petersen can arsenokoitai be translated by homosexuals i cor i tim vc k j dover greek homosexuality cambridge harvard univ n we are conscious of the fact that plato s writings may not reflect athenian society or that the speakers in symposium may not reflect plato s view however it is assumed that they do and with this agrees dover homosexuality and other evidence cited below the translation is that of w r m lamb plato symposioum lcl cambridge harvard univ note the reference to adulteress if there is a homosexual condition derived from birth or the genes logically there must also be an adulterous conditon derived from birth elsewhere in the symposium we are told that it is the heavenly love to love the male and young men c but this must not be love for boys too young the latter should be outlawed d e such love of youths is to be permanent d lifelong and abiding a where homosexual love is considered a disgrace such an attitude is due to encroachments of the rulers and to the cowardice of the ruled d an early charge of homophobia in athens it was more honorable to love openly than in secret d an ancient expression of coming out of the closet mutality was present this compels lover and beloved alike to feel a zealous concern for their own virtue b for petersen to label the symposium a possible exception to his position is inadequate and misrepresentative it is a significant witness to greek society hundreds of years before the time of christ dover homosexuality finds homosexual desire and orientation in plato s works symposioum and phaedrus and elsewhere philo writes of those who habituate themselves to the practive of homosexual acts the special laws cf de vita contemplativa josephus says that homosexuality had become a fixed habit for some against apion clement of alexandria on matt writes the some men from birth fhave a natural aversion to a woman and indeed those who are naturally so consitited do well not to marry miscellanies it is addressed in novella of justinian s codex of laws it referes to those who have been consumed by this disease as in need of renouncing there plague as well as acts pseudo lucian erostes and achilles tatius leucippe and clitophon ii speak of it finally thucydides has great is you glory if you fall not below the standard which nature has set for your sex boswell christianity cites poets juvenal ovid witers martial statesmen cicero and others who describe permanent mutual homosexual relationships even marriages even emperors could be either gay married nero or exlusively gay hadrian boswell says scroggs homosexuality admits that both

and exegetical commentary on deuteronomy edinburgh he observes that the prohibition of cross dressing in deut is not a mere rule of conventional propriety see also dover homosexuality plato in his

re the doctrine of original sin alan e alan idler aidler sol uvic ca writes alan we can also analyze to whom the lord is addressing marvel alan not that i said unto thee ye must be born again john alan here jesus is clearly directing his remarks to nicodemus a alan ruler of the jews not a child yes but jesus also made a very general and doctrinal statement in the same conversation flesh gives birth to flesh but the spirit gives birth to spirit john clearly infants are not born of the spirit thus without baptism they are unspiritual they are not born with the image of god but in adam s fallen image cf gen they have no righteousness of their own just as adults have no righteousness of their own there is only the imputed righteousness of christ which believers receive through faith alan we can ask ourselves why the lord would even introduce the alan concept of spiritual re birth through baptism if newborn babies alan weren t free from sin your point is a little obscure here but i think you are saying that christ used the innocence of newborn babes as a metaphor for spiritual re birth but this is not what he did if you look at the text he did not speak of spiritual re birth but of spiritual birth we are born of the spirit once not twice or several times we are also born of the flesh once the lord makes it clear that these are separate and different events it is true that other scriptures refer to spiritual birth as re birth because it is a second birth for example titus but it is not a second spiritual birth the only thing the two births have in common is the concept of birth which is used as a symbol of new life not of innocence when an infant is born or conceived a new life is begun but it is neither innocent nor righteous similarly when that same individual is baptized or perhaps when they believe prior to baptism they begin a new life in christ romans colossians titus ephesians then the believer has god s assurance of the forgiveness of their sins and of christ s imputed righteousness for references see the augsburg confession article ii original sin the apology to the augsburg confession article ii original sin the formula of concord article i original sin and luther s large catechism part baptism for something more recent see baptized into god s family the doctrine of infant baptism by andrew das available from northwestern publishing house andrew is a graduate of concordia lutheran seminary st louis and is now pursuing doctoral studies at yale divinity school david wagner but mad reason rushes forth a confessional lutheran and because baptism is not dazzling like the works we do regards it as worthless martin luther large catechism part baptism
info needed ok let me see if i can get all this out concisely i am on an information gathering venture regarding the various expressions of christianity churches there are my husband and i come from very different but completely christian backgrounds i was a lutheran when i met him and he was a born and raised church of christ member at first i agreed with a lot of what the c of c was about i wanted to move from the liturgical based lutheran church to something a little more biblical based however over the last year i ve been regretting changing to the church of christ for a number of reasons for one thing i am not a fundamentalist and believe that a few things in the bible are socio cultural in nature and don t relate to the christian doctrine one of my sorest spots is the role of women i believe that through mary and other women chris validated women as worthy disciples but in the c of c the writings of paul are taken without exception and i am told that i am not an equal partner in my marriage but the lesser member i am to submit to my husband in all things if i hear that verse one more time and i am not to take an active role in anything which might be construed as putting me in authority over men ie leading prayers conducting bible studies etc the last straw was when the elders at our church came down on one of our college groups because it was all women and they wanted a man to lead the study also my husband and i really resent the way everyone at our church feels that if you aren t a conservative republican you aren t a real christian i got told that nobody who voted for clinton should call themselves a christian hence we are subjected during the service to long prayers calling for things we flatly dont agree with we are also don t agree with the c of c s dread of any new movement being led by the young people so we have been church hunting with no success i want a reasonably biblical based church where women are viewed as whole people no matter what their calling c of c really looked down on career women christopher is looking for a church with deeply rooted religious convictions with adult baptism and a church where the members still bring their bibles to service we are so confused here and we re drifting around trying to find a place where we both feel loved and can express our faith honestly and without reservation if anyone can point us in a direction we d be thrilled i m afraid that it will be very hard for me to go back to c of c and even harder for me to stay churchless for long any responses would be welcome the diel family i would think somewhere in the baptist spectrum you might find what you re looking for however the issue is probably more one of the flavor of the specific local churches in your area than the denomination baptists cover quite a spectrum adult baptism sort of narrows your choices on the more liberal end of the spectrum historically that s been associated with movements that have the character you re trying to avoid clh

traveling fatima was re consecration and anniversary hello i just like to share this rosary and other prayer propagation practice we do in my country i am not sure if it is going on also here in the us or any other country in all these yrs i ve been here in illinois usa i have not encountered it may i just call it traveling fatima since i don t know of an exact translation of what we call it in my native language for certain regions in a district in a town or city an image statue of our lady of fatima is moved from one home originating from owner to another this will stay with that family for one week and this family is required to pray the rosary and other prayers prayer sheets accompany the image to our lady of fatima the move will be like a simple procession of folks picking up the image from its current home after departing prayers and proceeds to move it to the next home which has the prior notification about the move there will be the receiving prayers at the next home to welcome our lady of fatima image there it does not have to be that only members of the family in that home who must pray to the image they may invite others or others friends can invite themselves in to participate during prayer time in that new home everyday for one week this image is moved from one family to the next within the bounded region of that district until it goes back to the owner of the image this is probably going on around there philippines right now or somebody correct me when exactly since i forgot and every year this is part of our devotion to our lady of fatima it has been easy to facilitate this back home because it is more likely that your next door neighbor is a catholic and the image then is just moved next door i am thinking of starting something like it in the village where my sister and her family lives most of our friends and neighbors there are catholics and practicing ones i d like to know if there are any state community laws that this practice will violate whatsoever before i go for it thank you for any comments or help about this matter marida maridai ecs comm mot com

the doctrine of original sin stephen a creps writes to all sac also we know that sac the bible says that everyone must be baptized to enter heaven where exactly does it say that sac everyone includes infants unless there is other scripture to the sac contrary i e an exception since there is no exception listed in the sac bible we must assume to be on the safe side that the bible means what sac it says that everyone must be baptized to enter heaven i think we do see an exception in the case of cornelius and his household mentioned in acts of course they were baptised but only after god showed that he accepted them by giving them the holy spirit this means they were already acceptable to god before their baptism and had they suddenly died they would have gone to heaven in case that seems far fetched an ancestor of mine was a missionary who worked among the hereros in namibia some of the tribesmen were jealous of christianity and they poisoned the first convert before he could be baptised surely he still went to heaven i m inclined to agree with a comment recorded at the time it is not the neglect of baptism but its contempt that condemns mike internet mike hahn p f n z fidonet org via the catalyst bbs in port elizabeth south africa catpe alt za v bis hst
re is this ethical just a quick comment as a baptist clergyperson i find the idea of such a baptism if the news report is in fact accurate and they seldom are regarding religion offensive the pastor here seems to have a most unbaptist view of baptism one that seems to demand the ceremony even when comprehension and choice are absent we do baptize converts but no one who has been deceived into hearing the word is likely to be a convert if in fact the grace of god might work in such a situation there is no harm done in waiting a day or two baptist believe in regenerate membership did this church include these half baked at best converts into their church fellowship or do they somehow feel there is some validity in dunking them and turning them loose this kind of evangelism is certainly not baptist and probably not very christian either revdak netcom com

islam satanic dear fellow christians i had a dinner last night with a bible study group which i am in we had a discussion about the difference between christianity and islam and i was shocked to hear that our bible study teacher said that mohammad was indeed a prophet but of satan i said what i did not believe that because i have some moslem friends who are so kind and nice even sometimes i feel i wish i could be like them in my point of view they don t sin as much as i do how come if they were under satan they could have such personalities to tell you the truth i don t know much about islam but i know that they believe in god they believe in the day of judgement now i m asking you what your opinions about islam and its teaching important i do not want to discuss whether they are saved or not i do not want to discuss about politic related to islam p s i post this in bit listserv christia soc religion christian and bit listserv catholic in christ our lord smile jesus loves you tabut torsina torsina enuxhb eas asu edu let me start by saying that this is not the right newsgroup for a discussion of islam since there s a group for that but i suspect the point your teacher was making was not specifically about islam indeed it s going to be impossible to see what he was getting at within your groundrules since the question of whether non christians are saved is at the heart of it the classic christian view which i think most people believed until the last century or so was that christianity and of course judaism was the only religion founded by god and that all other religions worshipped false gods and came from satan this is more or less a corollary of another traditional view that no one but christians and possibly jews will be saved this need not mean that there s no truth in any other religion nor that all of their members are intentionally satanic after all in order to be an effective snare satanic alternatives would have to be attractive thus they might contain all kinds of truth wisdom and spiritual insights they would be missing only one thing knowledge of salvation through christ if this is the background of your teacher s remarks and i suspect it is that means that a discussion of islam is not necessarily relevant the point is not that there s anything intrinsically wrong with it it may teach a fine code of behavior and its practitioners may all be wonderful people but if salvation requires being a follower of christ it could still be a satanic invention this is a reasonable deduction from the classic protestant position christianity says that salvation isn t a matter of being kind and nice those are good things and we should encourage them but no one is able to do them enough to be saved salvation requires christ please forgive me for doing this in protestant terms there s a catholic equivalent to this that has similar implications but in different terms a religion may be quite attractive in all visible ways but if it doesn t have christ it s like a diet that consists of food that looks wonderful tastes great but is missing some essential food element so that you end up dying let me be clear that i am not specifically advocating this position what i m trying to do is as usual to clarify issues indeed it is now relatively uncommon for christians to believe that all other religions are satanic most christians regard such beliefs as an unfortunate vestige of the past this is part of a general move within christianity in the last century or so to a non judgemental god christians now find it hard to believe that god would allow anybody other than a really rotten person to end up in hell and they find it hard to envision that real malignant spiritual forces are at work in the world doing things like creating superficially attractive alternatives to christianity whether there is actually a sound basis for the shift is a decision that people need to make for themselves clh

the easy way out easy vs hard easy on who i had a rare very personal talk with my mother last year she said that when she and my father were raising we four children they did not try to raise us in this world as strictly as they were raised in their norwegian lutheran community they felt that we would be alienated from them and it would create problems in other words my parent did the very tolerant loving thing they raised us without conflict without what we saw as unreasonable demands and were always accepting no matter what the circumstances what happened was that i grew up believing in situation ethics and never absolutes i believed in a loving god and my concept of god never involved justice or punishment nor was there any concept that i may someday be held responsible for the things that offended him sins that the world told me were ok my parents are very good honest and moral people they raised four extremely honest children yet before coming to a more complete knowledge of god which includes the knowledge of justice and punishment i committed what i now believe to be many many grave sins i lived with a partner outside of marriage was married and divorced only after physical abuse and no apparent hope for change but i shouldn t have married to person in the first place and more my parents felt they were doing the loving kind thing by allowing us to be who we were by not imposing their standards on us and by accepting unquestioningly everything we did without judgement or counsel today it is absolutely appalling for me to look back on what they did accept without a word it takes courages to dare to help souls because you must speak up and say what is unpopular and difficult and what people do not want to hear you must be able to say what is hard and say it as christ would with love and compassion it involves risk perhaps someone you love may not want to hear and will stay away from you this life is but dust as long as the comfort of this life is our highest priority we will fail god and fail those with whom we come in contact i wonder how many who engage in sex outside of marriage who support the right to abortion who engage in homosexuality or who commit any of the range of sins that are plentiful in this time have ever heard from a quiet thoughtful loving friend that these things are wrong no one ever told me that what i was doing was wrong and i saw multitudes around me living the same way i was and they seemed like good decent people wouldn t kick dogs or beat the elderly or babies it is more difficult for sinners without a genuine prayer life to hear the holy spirit than it is to hear a loving friend think about this the next time the holy spirit tells you that a friend is in error but you don t want to cause trouble righteous prayers is great power but don t forget that we are we are christ s lips and hands on earth don t be afraid to simply voice truth when the situation calls for it say a fervent prayer and ask the holy spirit for love and guidance in more ways than we may realize we are our brother s keeper in jesus and mary elizabeth

murderous heavily armed religious cult despite much evidence to the contrary wellllll they weren t murderous they d never harmed or even threatened anybody until they were attacked by a paramilitary force using military weapons and hardware and as far as evidence what are you talking about everything the feds have said they ve retracted practically as soon as they get questioned in detail about it maybe you and your increased beverage access buddies sitting around the bar slurring stuff like they shoulda killed em all days ago don t feel that way but then you re probably one of those people still saying about klinton give the guy a chance we don t even know what he s gonna do burp thought experiment suppose this exact same thing happened under the bush administration what would your answer be then would you still prefer to believe the cultists no i don t really expect a response to that challenge no problem you don t have any questions that scare any of us most of our minds are apparently more developed than yours the answer is yes in a f cking heartbeat thought experiment would you be mindlessly down on your knees with your mouth open blissfully sucking up anything the feds said if bush were the president what no comeback ok go ahead say it read my lips no new taxes p but then again that is how mr clinton was elected by people who believe that his campaign promisses would be respected by him once he got into office um isn t that how all politicians are elected not in such a great degree bush broke one promise maybe two taxes guns and we held him accountable for it of course it took him the better part of years to do it slick s only been in office days and he s broken lots of them anddd i imagine he ll also be held accountable for that i can just see the campaign buttons now abc anybody but clinton so is there any particular reason the gummint decided to slaughter eighty people are they like just plain evil or what did they just wake up one day stretch and yawn and throw a dart at a map of the united states to figure out who to oppress that day i m eager to know hmmm apparently you just got here nobody s claiming that it was anything but a stupid mistake by a bunch of incompetent public employees who normally don t get this kind of scrutiny when the mess up and as far as how they picked the davidians who knows maybe they figured that nobody d care about such a politically incorrect group as a bunch of fundies out on the texas prairie maybe they figured they d just go in there and run roughshod over the bds during their religious services which was the reason the feds gave for the timing of the raid rather than running into resistance maybe they knew that the bds weren t anywhere near as violent as the feds spin doctors are trying to tell the public maybe they were afraid to try this kind of thing on the crips and bloods maybe it was because the atf s budget is up for approval and they seem to favor doing something dramatic whenever that is the case of course their reasoning doesn t matter only what they did and this time people are just paying more attention to it and does bill clinton have cooler theme music than darth vader not if you mean that stupid don t stop thinking about tomorrow how is he on diabolical laughter all i ve ever heard is hillary s diabolical giggle waffle man seems to have lost his sense of humor does he look good in a cape don t know never seen him in one he probably looks fat and puffy faced just like in a suit i saw him in the rose garden the other day and i couldn t get over how much he is starting to look like teddy kennedy these things must be investigated you first don t worry these things will be investigated now go back to your beer you dimwit i ve heard a lot of people compare bill clinton to jimmy carter and i d like to go on record as saying that i don t think that it s fair jimmy carter was a veteran and he had personal character and even though i can t agree with carter s policies i always believed that he was telling the truth as best he understood it i can t say that for the fat cat ken whitehead kdw odin icd ab com

re fbi director s statement on waco standoff the branch davidians were not violent and were not planning to start violence when the bd compound was assaulted by the atf the bd did fire back but they agreed to a cease fire and they allowed the atf to care for their wounded the bd even released the atf agents they captured it is clear from the release of the agents and allowing the atf medical attention that the bd were not looking for trouble if the bd were violent they would have held the atf agents as hostages they would not have released them like they did if they had kept the agents hostage they could have used them as bargening chips for medical attention etc a big thing is being made of the bd collection of weapons but no one has shown that they had any plans to use them it is also apparent that the bd did not have any military training if they had they could have dug bunkers and trenches and increased their fortifications they could have shot out the lights and speakers it appears that the bd were not violent they shot back at the attacking atf agents out of panic there were shots fired on the last day but they were in response to the fbi attack on the compound with armor all the violence in waco was initiated by the federal agents not the bd rod anderson n nzo the only acceptable substitute boulder co for brains is silence rcanders nyx cs du edu solomon short satellite n nzo on ao
waco fire flash over is a frequent occurrence with indoor fires a fire will start small and in one location and heat the air the temperature in the room builds up and then everything inflammable in the room catches fire at once this may have occurred in the bd compound i have heard reports that the windows were covered which would permit a fire to start unnoticed by those outside the compound when the fire got big enough and broke through the walls it appeared to be started in two places but was really one big fire because of the large quantities of tear gas inserted into the building it is possible that many of the women and children were in a room free of tear gas they would try to seal the door to keep out the tear gas when they learned that a fire had broken out it was too late for them to escape they were trapped by the flames in their safe room i find it hard to believe that the fbi was not recording the final assault i think that they would have wanted to have tapes to show their agents of the the fbi overcoming the forces of evil aka the branch davidians the tapes would also allow the fbi to prove that they were not using excessive force rod anderson n nzo the only acceptable substitute boulder co for brains is silence rcanders nyx cs du edu solomon short satellite n nzo on ao

sheet public encryption management the president has approved a directive on public encryption management the directive provides for the following advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption are part of a wave of new computer and communications technology encryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of communications and data by preventing unauthorized access advanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications these advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the infrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the information age despite its benefits new communications technology can also frustrate lawful government electronic surveillance sophisticated encryption can have this effect in the united states when exported abroad it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence activities critical to our national interests in the past it has been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law enforcement and national security interests while at the same time protecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens as encryption technology improves doing so will require new innovative approaches in the area of communications encryption the u s government has developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust than the current government standard but also permits escrowing of the keys needed to unlock the encryption the system for the escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization to assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect and decrypt under legal authority electronically transmitted information i hereby direct the following action to be taken installation of government developed microcircuits the attorney general of the united states or her representative shall request manufacturers of communications hardware which incorporates encryption to install the u s government developed key escrow microcircuits in their products the fact of law enforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from the american public all appropriate steps shall be taken to ensure that any existing or future versions of the key escrow microcircuit are made widely available to u s communications hardware manufacturers consistent with the need to ensure the security of the key escrow system in making this decision i do not intend to prevent the private sector from developing or the government from approving other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key escrow system key escrow the attorney general shall make all arrangements with appropriate entities to hold the keys for the key escrow microcircuits installed in communications equipment in each case the key holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent unauthorized release of the keys the keys shall be released only to government agencies that have established their authority to acquire the content of those communications that have been encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits the attorney general shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such communications procurement and use of encryption devices the secretary of commerce in consultation with other appropriate u s agencies shall initiate a process to write standards to facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted with key escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems that process sensitive but unclassified information i expect this process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of a final standard within six months of this directive the attorney general will procure and utilize encryption devices to the extent needed to preserve the government s ability to conduct lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure law enforcement communications further the attorney general shall utilize funds from the department of justice asset forfeiture super surplus fund to effect this purchase

re gun buy back in article bb b r vmcms csuohio edu r vmcms csuohio edu writes in article apr rti rti org jbs rti rti org writes in article bb ba a r vmcms csuohio edu r vmcms csuohio edu writes gun buyback programs will hopefully have an impact on accidental shootings especially youths domestic disputes where a gun is available in the heat of emotion and anger and maybe keep a few guns from being stolen and later used in street level crime what gives you the idea that gun buyback programs will have an impact on any of these things evidence please please don t misinterret what i was saying joe i was making the point tha there is no evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types of common incidents saying hopefully the effect of policy x will be y is much different from saying hopefully if there is any effect of policy x it will be y here you ve made both statements if the former describes a reasonably likely outcome of policy x then perhaps policy x is worthy of consideration but the latter statement is not something to base policy decisions on firearms are the fifth leading cause of unintentional deaths among children ages and under according to groups like the center to prevent handgun violence formerly the national coalition to ban handguns interesting name change don t you think who include murder and suicide by firearms in the leading causes of unintentional death figures but don t include murder and suicide by other means as causes of unintentional death can t you see past the bullshit i don t understand how the ratio to other accidental deaths is important so guns don t kill as many children as car accidents what is the difference in severity between deaths and deaths i am not trying to use accidental gun related deaths among children as a justification for gun control who needs to be convinced that accidental gun deaths of children is a serious problem i assumed that any humane person would be concerned when any year old got hold of their parents gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends certainly accidental deaths by any cause are serious things but the anti gun groups insist over and over again that accidental death by firearms is a stastically serious problem and even if you don t use these deaths as a justification for gun control these groups do i m sorry if i jumped to conclusions about your reason for mentioning accidental deaths due to firearms being something that warranted concern but in light of your statement that you are a staunch supporter of gun control measures i think the conclusion was a reasonable one the fact remains that tragic though individual accidental gun deaths may be they are not a serious problem statistically speaking please explain why you think symbolic offerings do good my point was gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police departments might i stress might do a little i stress little good by giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way overall i thought that i had made it clear that i did not think that gun buyback programs were useful sorry if it wasn t clear to me i thought you were waffling on your view of buyback programs with the talk of symbolic offerings and hopefully preventing accidents and heat of passion shootings i have to disagree on all these counts i can t understand how a buying guns from people who aren t intending to misuse them obviously those who want to use guns to commit crimes aren t going to turn them in could be construed as a positive way for police to respond to interpersonal violence i suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these statistics i suspect you ll find if you look carefully that is the number of students estimated to have carried a weapon not necessarily a gun to school at least once in the past year and not the number of students who carry a gun to school daily well joe i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence what the people who publish figures saying that as many children commit suicide by handguns alone each year as the fbi says commit suicide by all methods per year who do you think i should believe the people who call everyone up to age children when they re screaming about the carnage of our nation s children being caused by handguns or the centers for disease control ah yes the agency that considers accidental shootings of children to be such a statistical problem that a stated objective in the healthy people document is to enact laws in states requiring manufacturers of handguns to make the handguns more difficult to fire minimizing the likelihood of accidental or intentional dscharge by children the agency that funded the study of dc which pronounced that the dc gun ban had saved x lives yes they actually gave us a number on the basis of a look at the number of shootings rather than the rate of shootings it wasn t their fault that the population of dc dropped in their post law period if you look carefully you will see that you greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths the cphv reports that youth bring guns to school daily and that bring guns to school at least once a year the cdc estimates that out f high school students carried a gun to school at least once in okay i ll concede i no longer have the numbers i once read on these i ll retract my dispute of your numbers however i would be greatly interested in seeing how cphv and cdc came up with these numbers the cdc also says that million elementary aged latch key children kids who come home from school to an empty house have access to guns in their home what s this got to do with anything hell when i was in elementary school i came home to an empty house with guns in it why is this a problem i didn t touch the guns i had been taught not to i had also been taught not to mess with the gasoline in the garage the fuse box the car the knives the oven and the tools the problem is not the guns it s the parents california schools reported a increase in student gun confiscations between and and a increase between and florida reported a percent increase in gun incidents in schools between amd these are the statistics and what are these states doing with the kids they find with guns nothing no criminal prosecution no expulsion in most cases not even suspension they take the gun slap the kids on the wrist say ain t it awful and go on as if everything s back to normal what s wrong with this picture okay maybe i worded it wrong dad i meant that to put children in a situation fortified compound where harm could come to them is not the act of a messiah in my opinion i m not saying that koresh had control over these children directly but i would hope that whatever messiah there is would not let innocent children die i don t think koresh was the messiah either but isn t it obvious that if he believed the forces of evil were come to destroy him then he believed the children were much safer inside the compound i didn t say he was sane just that he behaved in a pretty rational manner given what he thought was going on he thought he had them in the one place where harm wouldn t come to them if as he claimed he was the messiah and people followed him as such why did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them burn alive let s see you try to find the exits unbarricade them and flee a fire

analysis of second amendment was re some more about gun control in article apr ra msstate edu dnewcomb whale st usm edu donald r newcomb writes first i would like to say how much i appreciate having so literate and erudite an individual as mr rutledge with whom to discuss this topic frankly most anti rkba posters refuse even to approach the topic of the original understanding of the bill of rights as detailed in the writings of the era this is most refreshing second i must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days my brigade s quarterly drill was this weekend and i needed to attend to several matters pertaining to the state militia some people seem to feel that the concept of the militia is an anachro nism that is out of place in the th century i m not sure the swiss would agree and i think perhaps a discussion of how the militia both organized and unorganized fits into the defense plans of my state mississippi please do not assume that this describes something peculiar to one southern state for instance the commonwealth of massachusetts has a well organized militia which members report maintains stocks of both riot guns and machine guns the laws of other states will vary but are probably similar it appears it is time that this article originally posted by larry cipriani last year and which i saved gets posted again it offers as good an analysis of the meaning of the second amendment especially regarding the militia clause as i have seen i have not seen any rebuttles with similar bone fides enjoy flames to dev null begin enclosed article the unabridged second amendment by j neil schulman if you wanted to know all about the big bang you d ring up carl sagan right and if you wanted to know about desert warfare the man to call would be norman schwarzkopf no question about it but who would you call if you wanted the top expert on american usage to tell you the meaning of the second amendment to the united states constitution that was the question i asked a c brocki editorial coordinator of the los angeles unified school district and formerly senior editor at houghton mifflin publishers who himself had been recommended to me as the foremost expert on english usage in the los angeles school system mr brocki told me to get in touch with roy copperud a retired professor journalism at the university of southern california and the author of american usage and style the consensus a little research lent support to brocki s opinion of professor copperud s expertise roy copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades before embarking on a a distinguished year career teaching journalism at usc since copperud has been writing a column dealing with the professional aspects of journalism for editor and publisher a weekly magazine focusing on the journalism field he s on the usage panel of the american heritage dictionary and merriam webster s usage dictionary frequently cites him as an expert copperud s fifth book on usage american usage and style the consensus has been in continuous print from van nostrand reinhold since and is the winner of the association of american publisher s humanities award that sounds like an expert to me after a brief telephone call to professor copperud in which i introduced myself but did not give him any indication of why i was interested i sent the following letter i am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in english usage to analyze the text of the second amendment to the united states constitution and extract the intent from the text the text of the second amendment is a well regulated militia being necessary for the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed the debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the sentence a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause with respect to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed i would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issues of political impact or public policy but be restricted entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent further since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regarding the consequences of the second amendment i ask that whatever analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation and even be willing to testify under oath to support if necessary my letter framed several questions about the test of the second amendment then concluded i realize that i am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task with this letter i am doing so because as a citizen i believe it is vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the second amendment while i ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of its results i ask that you do this because of that importance after several more letters and phone calls in which we discussed terms for his doing such an analysis but in which we never discussed either of our opinions regarding the second amendment gun control or any other political subject professor copperud sent me the follow analysis into which i have inserted my questions for the sake of clarity copperud the words a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state contrary to the interpretation cited in your letter of july constitutes a present participle rather than a clause it is used as an adjective modifying militia which is followed by the main clause of the sentence subject the right verb shall the to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for maintaining a militia in reply to your numbered questions schulman can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep and bear arms solely to a well regulated militia copperud the sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear arms nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by others than the people it simply makes a positive statement with respect to a right of the people schulman is the right of the people to keep and bear arms granted by the words of the second amendment or does the second amendment assume a preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms and merely state that such right shall not be infringed copperud the right is not granted by the amendment its existence is assumed the thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia schulman is the right of the people to keep and bear arms conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia is in fact necessary to the security of a free state and if that condition is not existing is the statement the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed null and void copperud no such condition is expressed or implied the right to keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence of a militia no condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well regulated militia as a requisite to the security of a free state the right to keep and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence schulman does the clause a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state grant a right to the government to place conditions on the right of the people to keep and bear arms or is such right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence copperud the right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional as previously stated it is invoked here specifically for the sake of the militia schulman which of the following does the phrase well regulated militia mean well equipped well organized well drilled well educated or subject to regulations of a superior authority copperud the phrase means subject to regulations of a superior authority this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian control over the military schulman if at all possible i would ask you to take account the changed meanings of words or usage since that sentence was written years ago but not take into account historical interpretations of the intents of the authors unless those issues can be clearly separated copperud to the best of my knowledge there has been no change in the meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment if it were written today it might be put since a well regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged schulman as a scientific control on this analysis i would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the second amendment to the following sentence a well schooled electorate being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and read books shall not be infringed my questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the words modify each other identical to the second amendment s sentence and could this sentence be interpreted to restrict the right of the people to keep and read books only to a well educated electorate for example registered voters with a high school diploma copperud your scientific control sentence precisely parallels the amendment in grammatical structure there is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the possibility of a restricted interpretation professor copperud had only one additional comment which he placed in his cover letter with well known human curiosity i made some speculative efforts to decide how the material might be used but was unable to reach any conclusion so now we have been told by one of the top experts on american usage what many knew all along the constitution of the united states unconditionally protects the people s right to keep and bear arms forbidding all governments formed under the constitution from abridging that right as i write this the attempted coup against constitutional government in the soviet union has failed apparently because the will of the people in that part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the old guard s desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power and here in the united states elected lawmakers judges and appointed officials who are pledged to defend the constitution of the united states ignore marginalize or prevaricate about the second amendment routinely american citizens are put in american prisons for carrying arms owning arms of forbidden sorts or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements regarding the owning and carrying of firearms all of which is an abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms guaranteed by the constitution and even the american civil liberties union aclu staunch defender of the rest of the bill of rights stands by and does nothing it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to preserve that right no one else will no one else can will we beg our elected representatives not to take away our rights and continue regarding them as representing us if they do will we continue obeying judges who decide that the second amendment doesn t mean what it says it means but means whatever they say it means in their orwellian doublespeak or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice as the constitution of the united states promises us we can and pledge that we will defend that

re gun buy back in article r qqcinn j clem handheld com jmd cube handheld com jim de arras writes in article bb b r vmcms csuohio edu r vmcms csuohio edu writes in article apr rti rti org jbs rti rti org writes in article bb ba a r vmcms csuohio edu r vmcms csuohio edu writes gun buyback programs will hopefully have an impact on accidental shootings especially youths domestic disputes where a gun is available in the heat of emotion and anger and maybe keep a few guns from being stolen and later used in street level crime what gives you the idea that gun buyback programs will have an impact on any of these things evidence please please don t misinterret what i was saying joe i was making the point tha there is no evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types of common incidents if you re a research associate in urban child research then perhaps you can comment for us on the ratio of the accidental gun death rate to the rate of accidental death from other single causes follow that perhaps with some sort of justification for the amount of effort that anti gunners spend trying to convince the country that accidental gun related death among children in the u s is a serious problem firearms are the fifth leading cause of unintentional deaths among children ages and under i don t understand how the ratio to other accidental deaths is important so guns don t kill as many children as car accidents what is the difference in severity between deaths and deaths i am not trying to use accidental gun related deaths among children as a justification for gun control who needs to be convinced that accidental gun deaths of children is a serious problem i assumed that any humane person would be concerned when any year old got hold of their parents gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends any death is serious wanna discuss match control firearms related unintentional deaths among children ages and under are the fault of one or more negligent persons not the gun did i say that a child who unintentionally shoots someone is not negligent no i hate to repeat myself jim but like i told joe i was not attempting in any way to justify gun control you re right any death is serious that was my point to joe who said that anti gunners try to convinve the country that accidental gun deaths related to children are a serious problem i guess i assumed everyone thought that it was a problem no i don t want to discuss match control i don t equate a book of matches to a loaded millimeter either don t confuse the issue and please don t say that tired old nra line guns don t kill people people kill people sure people can kill people without guns but easy access to guns makes it a lot more convenient guns don t kill people people with easy access to guns kill people more than anything gun buyback programs are symbolic offerings to the community in that sense i think they might do a little good please explain why you think symbolic offerings do good my point was gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police departments might i stress might do a little i stress little good by giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way overall i thought that i had made it clear that i did not think that gun buyback programs were useful providing false hope then is the intent jim i m just saying how it is i m not saying if that is a good thing or not from the police who i have talked with who run some of these gun buyback programs i get the impression that they really think they are having an impact on the community when i ask them if they have an evaluatory component to the program they say well no so in answer to your question no false hope is not the intent i think the intent is to show folks that police are attempting to do something to curb interpersonal gun violence whether its effective or not look if you can t measure the impact of these programs using some sort of pre test and post test evaluation what is the point it must be symbolic in nature the police are essentially saying look if you have a gun lying around and you don t want it we ll give you for it because we care about the community if you i and joe could think of a way to measure the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of these programs we could become rich and famous i do know that the vast majority of guns that are used by youths or brought to school by youths on a daily basis about youths are obtained easily and quickly through a personal friend or more often borrowed from a parent without their knowledge i suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these statistics i suspect you ll find if you look carefully that is the number of students estimated to have carried a weapon not necessarily a gun to school at least once in the past year and not the number of students who carry a gun to school daily well joe i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence or the centers for disease control if you look carefully you will see that you greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths the cphv reports that youth bring guns to school daily and that bring guns to school at least once a year the cdc estimates that out f high school students carried a gun to school at least once in the cdc also says that million elementary aged latch key children kids who come home from school to an empty house have access to guns in their home california schools reported a increase in student gun confiscations between and and a increase between and florida reported a percent increase in gun incidents in schools between amd these are the statistics increase in california schools eh gun control is working fine there i didn t anything about gun control what are you talking about thus willing to follow a man who claimed to be the messiah got news for you folks if the big cheese was on this crazy planet of ours presently he would not be carrying a gun or holding children when they were in danger holding kids time for a reality check son these kids were the children of the people inside who believed that the forces of evil were outside waiting to kill them would you send your children out the door if you believed as they did okay maybe i worded it wrong dad i meant that to put children in a situation fortified compound where harm could come to them is not the act of a messiah in my opinion i m not saying that koresh had control over these children directly but i would hope that whatever messiah there is would not let innocent children die if as he claimed he was the messiah and people followed him as such why did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them burn alive thanks for the reality check joe its been real so your religion is different does that make it his wrong even assuming koresh actually made that decision and the verdict is still out on that jim listen to me i said i m not religious whatsoever do you understand religion has nothing to do with this i could care less what religion they were okay to put children in that situation is wrong pure and simple difference is good jim i am the most progressive and diverse person in the world but if different is allowing kids to be exposed to tanks and tear gas then yes jim different is wrong

waco questions folks it s time to start building some precise questions to send to our federal elected officials and to investigative reporters in our local tv radio and newprint media ideally these questions could be asked at any investigation into the batf s and fbi s participation at the waco fiasco in hopes of being resolved and hopefully wake up the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth from the batf and fbi my list is up to that are really nagging at my gut the list will probably grow what were the contents of the original warrant now sealed that the batf obtained it is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and or ammunition could not be flushed down the toilet therefore a no knock raid could be ruled out prior to the initial assault on the complex did a single batf agent and accompanying witness without a contingent of assault and news media personnel attempt to knock on the door of the branch davidian s complex and serve the warrant in a manner prescribed by law on the day of the initial assault on the complex batf agents were aware that several small children were inside the buildings in the ensueing gun battle batf agents fired into a building known to contain children killing at least one two year old child knowing children were present why didn t the batf have an alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building the fbi spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that david koresh and members of the branch davidians possessed over in firearms and ammunition did david koresh and the members of the branch davidians have a valid federal firearms license were they actively participating in the legal business of selling buying firearms and ammunition and were any of the weapons they had illegally possessed does this paper evidence consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally dispossessed weapons after the original assault on the compound tragically failed a batf spokeswoman stated we were outgunned yet tv newscasts of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show batf agents armed with mp and ar m rifles although unclear on the video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent s bodies they also may have had ak and sks rifles what type s of firearms did the batf agents have immediate access to at the scene of the original assault on the complex since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the complex involuntarily why did the fbi treat it as a hostage situation along the same lines why did the fbi use psychological warfare techniques including sensory overload sleep deprivation and other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind reports indicate several of the children inside the complex were accompanied by their mothers since it is reasonable to expect these mothers would have their children taken away from them if they came out why did the fbi expect the mothers to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the branch davidians setting fire to the complex branch davidian members who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a lantern which was setting on a table video tape of the incident does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle penetrated fbi spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the david koresh and the members of the branch davidians committed mass suicide yet bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas within the building complex this seems to be counter to any known mass suicides through history what evidence does the fbi have that a mass suicide pact existed fbi director sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on the video tape was caused by the branch davidian s ammunition and or powder cache exploding yet the fireball seems to be more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas or other highly volatile fuel source explodes was any evidence found which would indicate the branch davidians had an ammunition and or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball if so and if david koresh and members of the branch davidians were engaged in the legal business of selling buying firearms was the amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect for someone engaged in such a legal business it is rumored that one fbi agent was extremely upset about critical news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to crush a reporter s car which had been left at the compound is there any factual basis to this rumor and if so what charges will be brought against the fbi agent who performed the act fbi director sessions states that during the final assault on the complex over shots were fired at the vehicles on the video tape of the incident you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles engines yet there is no sound of the sharp reports that one would expect to hear if shots were fired also there are no indications of smoke and or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows buildings or other structures in the video surely these should be evident if the branch davidians had fired on the armored vehicles finally the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be apparent if the branch davidians had fired upon the vehicles do any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by shots from high power rifles cs gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent the united states has signed international treaties which prevent the use of cs gas in warfare if the united states could not morally use cs gas against saddam hussein and his troops why is it morally acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land on april fbi spokesmen state that at least bodies discovered in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had been murdered or had committed suicide on april the county coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet wounds to the head were any of the victims bodies found within the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head ron phillips crphilli hound dazixca ingr com senior customer engineer intergraph electronics east

yes surveyed career criminals and found that only of guns used in violent crimes were purchased from retail dealers national institute of justice research in brief november the armed criminal in america by james d wright legitimate firearms retailers play only a minor role as direct sources of handguns for adult felony offenders only about one sixth of the gun owning felons obtained their most recent handguns through a customary retail transaction involving a licensed firearms dealer the remainder five out of six obtained them via informal off the record transactions involving friends and associates family members and various black market outlets the means of acquisition from these informal sources included cash purchase swaps and trades borrowing and renting and often theft the criminal handgun market is overwhelmingly dominated by informal transactions and theft as mechanisms of supply independence issue paper no independence institute denver west parkway golden co why gun

greenville the study found that about one to two percent of sales were to dangerous criminals in short waiting periods have no statistically noticeable impact on any type of crime because only a tiny fraction of crime guns are purchased at retail by ineligible buyers bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms assistant director of criminal enforcement memorandum to director july greenville survey of

independence issue paper no the assault weapon panic political correctness takes aim at the constitution by eric morgan and david kopel testimony before congress revealed that most assault weapons in the hands of criminals were obtained through illegal channels the testimony is consistent with the national institute of justice s research findings based on studies of felons in state prisons the nu study authored by sociologists james d wright and peter rossi found that only sixteen percent of criminals had obtained their most recent handgun from a gun store the figures included purchases by legal surrogates rather than directly by the criminal wright and rossi who had begun their research as firm proponents of gun control concluded that no set of controls on retail purchases and probably not even full scale gun prohibition would reduce criminal use of guns wright and rossi suggested that lawmakers concerned about gun crime directly target the black market in criminal guns and leave the legitimate retail market alone not surprisingly wright believes that the consequences of current assault weapon legislation on street violence are likely to be ineffective he warns that gun

re the truth about waco jgd dixie com john de armond writes nothing could at this point what would have gone a long way toward convincing me would have been media video particularly from diverse sources imho if the government didn t have anything to hide they would have allowed cameras near the compound from the beginning i agree i saw no reason they could not have had close in pool cameras manned by volunteers and protected by sandbags or whatever points made by dick degueran koresh s lawyer the tanks were not pumping cs gas but were ejecting exploding canisters from the tank booms that penetrated multiple walls before exploding okay their word against the fbi s at this point see ya in court the tanks were collapsing interior walls and ceilings putting people at great risk dear dear they could have come out the construction of the coupound used almost all used materials that were very dry and bails of hay were stacked against the walls as shields against the government s bullets okay they were living in a fire hazard that they built said that previous to the invasion there were no military drills and that the supplies they had on hand were for survival no crime irrelevant either way their gas masks worked so well that many members were having bible study and some were sleeping when the fire was set ah yes that is exactly what i would do hold bible study take a nap always a wise course of action when you re being gassed there was no group instruction of any kind from koresh or his aids after the tank invasion referring to any kind of suicide pact or counter assault efforts i don t believe there was a suicide pact i believe that koresh wanted a fiery conflagration which he may not have told his followers in fact this hypothesis is confirmed by the survivors stories everyone had moved to the center of the compound in order to escape the falling debris from the tank invasion when the fire was set yes that s right and once the whole compound was demolished where did they expect to go women and children who has sought shelter on the second floor from the tanks were trapped by doors jammed by the tanks ramming the building and distorting the frames the building is being rammed and they are going upstairs that s almost as bad as running into a fire hallways ran the length of the buildings that acted as conduits for the fire and trapped almost everyone in place his experts have told him that this horizonal chimney effect is what made the fire appear to have started at several places at once hm an interesting notion we ll see koresh was not seen the last hour before the fire and was assumed to be in his th floor room with some of his children more bible study no doubt hey it s a priority the texas medical examiner has stated flatly that none of the bodies recovered so far had bullet wounds directly contradicting the fbi s lies actually on friday he stated that there was no evidence either way and he could not flatly contradict the federal agents claims we ll know more later in any event it s irrelevant the survivors unanimously stated that if the victims could have gotten out they would have that they were trapped by the tank destroyed building and the speed of the fire for six hours they were trapped the building was not destroyed immediately they could have left at any time the underground bunker cited by the fbi as the place koresh could have put the children had he not been a cold blooded killer had been blocked by the tanks crashing down debris on top of the access door six hours to move it away or come out dick said that he had sat in koresh s bedroom talking to him and had observed that his room was furnished like all the rest and without air condition or other luxuries directly contradicting the fbi s claim that he lived in splendor irrelevant anyway pr one way or the other but no crime or innocence indicated dick saw bullet holes in koresh s room made from the outside in which indicates the batf was indiscriminately shooting down through the roof no word on whether they were being fired back at which is an operative question here the fire was probably started by the tanks knocking over coleman lanterns that were lit and sitting on a piano next to the wall the tanks busted through though none of the survivors saw the fire start right for six hours you know that a tank could come thru the wall at any point and you leave a coleman lantern burning near bales of hay every one of the survivors strongly denies ever saying anything to the fbi about starting the fire hearing someone say the fire was lit or any of the other stuff attributed to them by the fbi it s ultimately irrelevant who lit the fire they had ample opportunity to leave he said when he first met koresh in the compound he expected to find a raving lunatic but instead found a rational charming and intelligent young man and was very surprised by that fact most charismatic leaders are extremely intelligent actually they tend to be excellent actors and skilled manipulators ex ted bundy koresh had no drugs stronger than aspirin to use against pain medical assistance was jsut a phone call away gee all he had to do was come out women with children had their own bedrooms for them and their kids that were appointed as nicely as koresh s not relevant to any crimes dick said he saw signs of home schooling for the kids and at no time did he ever see any signs of abuse while he was there anyway outsiders rarely see abuse it s a secretive thing all we have to go on are the court documents in the jewell case and the mistrial in california no one was ever held against their wills and could have left at any time the people who were murdered in the fire were there by their own choices exactly by their own choice he called for an independent prosecutor if ever there were a need for one this is it looks like there will be several investigations starting with congressional committee hearings next week his closing comments were they don t look upon themselves as a cult they view themselves as highly religious people they sincerely believe what they believe and who am you or i to judge that as wrong his last sentence says it all who the hell are we or the government to judge their religion as wrong this event i hope will be recorded in history as the american holocaust these people were murdered by the us government just as surely as the jews were by the nazis i hang my head in shame for what i ve allowed my government to become i have never judged them by their religion but by their actions if they had lived a quiet religious life as they claimed there would have been no raid no siege and no deaths instead they chose courses of action at every turn that were at the very least stupid if not irrational the first was to stockpile weapons the second was to shoot federal agents the third was to stay inside just as we don t blame a cop who shoots a kid who had pointed a toy weapon at him i don t think the fbi deserves blame in this case the koresh cult standoff is over may his victims recquiescat in pace the above is a net moment of silence daniel a hartung dhartung

citizens cannot depend on the police for effective protection they usually respond after a crime has been committed in truth the supreme court has held that the police are not responsible for protecting any individual only the whole community as a society are we going to ask women once again to sacrifice themselves are we going to continue to deny women the ability to help themselves here s a thought neil smith in his book the probability broach says no pound thug can threaten the well being or dignity of a pound woman who has two pounds of iron to even things out but if a woman decides to protect herself with the easiest most efficient means possible people especially other women are horrified eughh how could you i d be terrified they ask how could you hurt someone they ll repeat the lie it ll just get taken away from you in truth of defensive gun uses result in the offender taking the gun away from the victim kleck well despite the lies and the social pressure some of us have already made that hard choice we ve decided that we are not going to be victimized by the muggers burglars or rapists we re buying more guns than every before we re learning how to use them and teaching others women and men how to use them most importantly we are preparing ourselves mentally to use our firearms for our own defense we re taking our own security literally into our own hands we re going to stop begging and pleading and marching and what we intend is to really take back the night but there s another threat more insatiable than any mugger more secretive than any burglar more soul destroying than any rapist that menace is government and it threatens us all we know that governments throughout time have suppressed rights and oppressed people it s the way they survive in our names and with our money it interferes with innocent people both at home and abroad it lies to us cheats us steals from us and threatens us with violence no one knows exactly what it ll do next what freedom we will lose because some government goon decides it s for your own safety or we know best any person who acted like government does would be psychoanalyzed within an inch of his life and locked up as a habitual offender but this monster called government persists and grows and we who should be its masters have become its unwilling slaves do you doubt me then why did you file your income tax like any reasonable person i believe that being afraid of something that can hurt you is smart and that paranoia isn t crazy if someone s really after you and make no mistake they re after you and they re after me their names are familiar brady and reynolds groff metzenbahm moynihan and clinton if we re lucky they ll settle for our assault rifles our shotguns our handguns and our ammunition as citizens we have only two choices they are the same two choices given to women to surrender or to fight surrender leads to the gulag to the genocide of pol pot to the disappearances to dachau i do not intend to surrender a battle can be philosophical or political in the main the people keep the government honest by threatening to vote it out of office but if they have to they will keep in mind the words of thomas jefferson the tree of liberty must be well watered with the blood of patriots as a patriot i will point out the error in the government s ways i will do my best to vote the villains out of office i will protest and write and speak and teach our children justice honor and truth and always remember that rebellion can lead to bunker hill and saratoga or it can lead to tiananmen square when the time comes to stand up if i have to give my life to keep them from going too far if there is a tiananmen square in our future i intend to be there and no matter what lies they tell and no matter what laws they pass i intend to meet them with something more substantial in my hand than a brick my opinions are of course my own

dealing with cults a few thoughts in the wake of the waco denouement i had email discussions with people from this group in particular we discussed how cults operate why the fbi might be motivated to black out news or behave the way it did and what kinds of problems are involved in dealing with cults and similar organizations i include an edited account of what i wrote the identity of my correspondents have i hope been erased the editing process makes the text choppy sorry about that i ve tried to retain the information content ellipses indicate where text was removed a few of the comments in parentheses are new intended to make it easier for outsiders to understand these notes are preliminary feel free to criticize cheers oded begin included text i took a course called the madness of crowds the course included cults and briefly mentioned analyzed jonestown did some external reading too william adorno edited a series of books on the psychology of evil mass movements starting with the authoritarian personality university of chicago press an attempt to figure out what would motivate people to support fascism or be the bad guys in wwii and by extension in other wars in racial lynchings i don t think the books are perfect and the study of psychopathology has advanced but you can elicit koresh types from even the first volume so i think they re onto something how cult psychology works i m an amateur hope i m not hopelessly naive so long as koresh could own his people he made sure they didn t believe there was any life out there for them away from him otherwise he d koresh be nothing during the siege ex davidians recounted how he convinced the people in the compound they survived only through his intercession with god to spare their worthless souls absolutely classic brainwashing technique as long as they believed him they d ignore batf fbi child protective services or even the red cross asking them to come out after all if they ever left him god would catapult them straight to hell and the combined forces of the us gummint with all the goodwill in the world doubtful couldn t save them for a second if i believed it i d stay and die too like the folks in jonestown for a prosaic analogy replace a cult leader with an estranged wife or husband and notice how many folks show up kill the ex and then themselves that s the consequence of shattered cultism it really does happen all the time by the way the treasured ideal in such cases without which life is meaningless is the relationship no matter how abusive rather than the individual s partner why no news don t the feds owe the world an explanation i agree that official explanations are in order i can also see good reasons for news blackouts the only fact available is that had the fbi not acted yesterday those people would be alive today that no matter what those people would have died because koresh made sure they believed they had no lives outside his influence hence it would make little difference when or how the fbi acted he held them hostage as his trump against going to jail but nothing would really stop him from offing them even if the fbi went away look at history rep leo ryan and some staffers visited jonestown at the request of constituents who had relatives there once jonestown was discovered and even though they killed ryan and his entourage they all killed themselves because jim jones knew he d be busted internal arguments asking to spare the children brought up by some of the women in the cult were shouted down there are tapes the logic of saying that no matter how bad the gummint is it wouldn t kill the kids was shouted down as blasphemy and the people who brought it up were threatened with ostracism by people who by their own avowal would be dead within the hour i suspect it s the same with the branch davidians there s a book on jonestown by james reston jr titled our father who art in hell i don t know whether it s good never read it the only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate reports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment or organizations buying full auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via ups on the off chance of stumbling across cults that would kill themselves so the only way the batf fbi could save those people and future cults is by ignoring such signs i suppose there s another way outsmarting koresh and tricking him into letting them go or somehow influencing his people to abandon him while he owns most of their means of communication with the world a mighty tough row to hoe i suspect the fbi tried to do that with blackouts noise and other sensory insults however maybe they re not very sophisticated or maybe the job is impossible it s certainly possible the guy running the show was a jerk why the fbi might want to blackout during and coverup after if they were doing a poor job of weaning the bd s from koresh they d want to keep it quiet so they wouldn t be embarrassed if they were trying to wean the bd s from koresh they d want to keep it quiet so he couldn t outflank them or well meaning boneheads from any point of view wouldn t screw it up i hate playing chess when the world screams in my face especially if at checkmate time people really die and i could be blamed i don t think ignoring such incidents is a workable policy unless you deny the fbi batf child protective services of whatever stripe and the rest of the gummint should exist at all the end okay have at it

photographers removed from compound relay of coverage seen there was a press conference by authorities at the compound on cnn earlier today wednesday it was explained that two news photographers were found on the compound earlier this morning without permission it was explained to the press corps that this is dangerous and that an unknown photographer turning around with a long lens camera could be mistaken for someone dangerous by a texas ranger surveying the site the two photographers were said to be currently in jail and the press were warned to follow the authorities guidelines it was also emphasized that the survey of the crime scene at this point was crucial and that the press could not be allowed to interfere the press will not be allowed in until the bodies are removed and the site has been completely surveyed for evidence for a court case that is the gist of the beginning of the conference to the best of my memory i bring this up because i haven t seen anyone else note it and i haven t seen the regular newscasts mention it it will probably be mentioned in the papers tomorrow my opinions i find this disturbing while i believe that koresh is largely responsible for not ending this standoff in a peacable manner during the last days of patient opportunity i find the secrecy surrounding the aftermath more damaging to the authorities position than they realize since the vast majority of potential defendents in a court case are already dead the emphasis on the importance of building the court case seems overblown to me it will be interesting to see the hearings on this affair i have also heard congressional calls for a review and possible overhaul of government enforcement agencies which you will recall i have stated would be a good idea in previous months please also note that i by no means endorse or agree with the many conspiracy type theories i have read here and in other groups as usual i am basing my opinions on info gathered from various media and filtered by my own common sense and consideration of plausibility imho as such my opinion is subject to change as more information is made available scott roby standard disclaimer

re rewording the second amendment ideas dfo vttoulu tko vtt fi foxvog douglas writes viking iastate edu dan sorenson writes that really depends upon where you draw the line while defining these weapons this means you would support a ban if it were narrow enough good very narrow very very narrow if you ll recall i was the nut that advocated the possibility of tactical nukes being militia weapons in certain situations how can you possibly define what is a weapon and what isn t is only the start of this and also on if you intend the law to be reflective of modern practice five months or five centuries down the road i would hope so let s define a nuclear weapon as an explosive weapon whose majority of energy comes from fission and or fusion of atomic nuclei and you ve just described any civilian reactor because your definition fails to note what energy is being considered reactors blow with a steam explosion but the majority of energy still comes from fission or fusion because that is what heated the coolant see what a can of worms this is last i heard ft calhoun station just north of omaha nebraska wasn t considered a weapon given the sodium cooled breeder designs on the blocks now i can easily envision reactors being household appliances in under twenty years with the prism design there is no operator input needed on the reactor itself and it is not unreasonable to assume the secondary side can be made equally as automatic in the future so your definition is flawed in a few respects already let s define a biological weapon as live organisms or viruses in such state quantity and with such a vector that they could cause death or serious disease further defined to a significant number of people if released in a city similarly populated area resevoir or cropland typhoid mary would likely fit this bill if she sneezed if you don t mind extrapolation any hiv positive person also fits this bill if they interact with others in a way that stands any chance of spreading the virus finally that manure pile i mention below fits this definition as does say releasing a pet rattlesnake to the wild nerve gas and mustard gas are well defined other poisonous gasses should be individually banned only if it can be shown that there is no use not related to weaponry licenses should be available for research purposes on such chemicals and i can show where any such gas has other uses for example perhaps we would like to rid the hay field of gophers calcium carbide is a rock that dissolves in water to produce aceteylne gas it can be used for welding in miners lamps for gassing gophers or for making carbide bombs and doing some illicit fishing toss some in a toilet and leave a lighted cigarette on the seat and you ll see that it can also be a weapon just like any other flammable substance so now my miners lamps won t work i can t do any welding and i still have those pesky gophers i am not a lawyer but these ideas could certainly be a basis for definitions the basis for but i m sure you see that the problem is not in writing a law it is in writing a law that cannot be abused and extended beyond the point where it does any good i ll give you a little hint see that manure pile in the farmer s field down the road in the usa that is a weapon of mass destruction nope it is not considered a weapon it is under your proposed law so is a silage pit if there is run off so are underground fuel tanks biological in nature because if it gets washed into an open well it will contaminate the aquifers that supply thousands of cities with drinking water so where do you draw the line in the usa the epa has ruled that a pile of scrap iron is illegal care to draw a thinner line this time it is not defined as a weapon of mass destruction many things are banned for other reasons it meets all the criterion of a weapon it is an instrument that can be used for fighting even though that is not its intended purpose and despite there being better weapons around given that the aquifers supply a significant part of the country with drinking water mass destruction is rather a given it s not that certain weapons aren t something i d rather not see a lot of people having the problem is that it is nearly impossible to write a law such that it cannot be abused upon some pretext or another the looser your definition the more ripe for abuse that law is furthermore if you get specific then the old standby is to insert a clause allowing the list of banned things to be added to generally without going through the hassles of another vote and public reading of the law again ripe for abuse dan sorenson dod z dan exnet iastate edu viking iastate edu isu only censors what i read not what i say don t blame them usenet post to exotic distant machines meet exciting unusual people and flame them

don kates talk on the branch davidians this was posted by lyn bates to the firearms politics mailing list i recently learned that don kates was going to be in boston to give a talk at the harbard law school about the waco situation of course this was all set up after the incident started but long before its unhappy conclusion so yesterday i went to hear him what follows is a rough summary of what i think i heard him say which should not be taken as exactly what he actually said kates started by saying that since he didn t know any more about the fire than the audience did it had just happened the day before he would not discuss that but would concentrate on the original raid koresh definitely was not playing with a full deck but so what this isn t the first time that the leader of a new small religious group has been ridiculed by the public extreme religious views nearly always fuel hatred and mistrust the first amendment applies maybe especially to people like koresh lengthy digression into the history of police organizations in the us there were none until about when they began in metropolitan areas police originally were not armed if they found a crime in progress they called local armed citizens to help many began to carry arms for protection despite regulations against them eventually the laws were changed to allow them to carry guns the original intent was to have many small police departments jealous of one another and competitive but not large enough to be a threat to liberty hence the plethora of organizations ranging from postal inspectors to the coast guard when the fbi was started agents did not have the authority oto carry guns they were to be after all a bureau of investigation not a police force all police agencies will be misused by anyone in power to maintain that power the batf started as a tax collection agency whose primary job was to raid illegal stills when the price of sugar went up so high that moonshiners no longer found their trade no longer profitable many illegal stills disappeared and the batf needed something else to do to justify its existence so it turned to activities like phony raids on gun stores around the time when the batf s annual budget is under review the media is alerted by the batf to come to such and such a place where at a pre arranged time a bunch of cars full of batf agents roar up to the door and the media get great pictures of the agents entering the premises of a gun dealer suspected of not keeping books properly the media isn t invited in for the boring hours of agents leafing through paperwork but if any irregularities are found the media gets to cover the agents removing armfuls of guns from the premises and the luckless ffl in chains the waco incident happened a few weeks before batf s budget was up for review kates opinion is that it was a staged publicity stunt that went bad and that the batf never thought for a moment that they would actually be shot at or they would have planned the raid differently not sending agents over open ground with no cover for example and would have had some medical personnel on hand he confirmed that some years ago there was a warrant for koresh s arrest in connection with a murder charge and the local sheriff called him on the phone and explained about it koresh sais ok come pick me up and the sheriff did temporarily confiscating all the guns so that they could be tested koresh was later cleared release and presumably got his guns back at least at that time he was rational enough to be approached rationally and behaved in a reasonable manner the batf didn t take into account that unlike most of the ffl s they audit koresh was actually paranoid and fostered paranoia in his followers thus the pubicity stunt looked like a real attack to them and they reacted accordingly with respect to the original warrant it had not been unsealed when kates was giving his talk so he could not comment on it except to mention that the batf has been known to not double check the veractiy of their informants if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant he had more to say about the way the warrant was served which may have been completely illegal apparently the proper way to serve a warrant is to knock on the door and announce that you re an officer with a warrant for thus and so if they don t open the door and the evidence is flushable then it is ok to break in the door but since it is hard to flush guns down the toilet there may have been no justification for the batf breaking in the way they did if the constitutional rights of the davidians were violated by an invalid warrant or by an improperly served warrant then the davidians may have been justified in their actons a close look at one of the original films shows that one batf agent may have shot himself by accident when entering the building if so this was the first shot fired the role of the media could have been a whole lot worse after an initial position on the side of the batf the media began to come around to the view that this might be a situation in which legally armed citizens held off a bad possibly illegal attack a real cynic might say that the fbi went in when they did because it was clear that public opinion was beginning to change sides and the fbi wanted to act before they lost the public s sympathy should the batf be abolished no police agencies should be numerous diverse inefficient decentralized etc better a few inept accidents like this than a move toward a single large well organized well trained powerful domestic police force which would eventually have even more tragic results lyn bates bates bbn com ps don kates will be giving a shorter version of this talk at boston college law school next

stuff about british cult members deleted what exactly are you trying to say and why were there no fire engines within a mile of the compound because the gun loonies were firing on vehicles with mm amunition that has a range of meters they were using caliber ammunition not mm ammo mm would be cm a shell of this size would be larger than a lot of cannon shells snipers could have screened the people trying to put out the fire besides the ranch house not fort apocalypse it was just a house despite what the fbi and atf says was on fire the gun loonies couldn t hardly have been shooting at fire men while there house was engulfed in flames the fbi and atf don t have any excuse for not having fire engines there to put out the blaze the bastards waited until the fire was well under way before they called the fire department in waco they didn t even tell the fire department to be on standby i sincerely hope that the fbi atf attorney general janet reno and all others involved in this fiasco get the just punishment that they so richly deserve someone should pay for this needless tragic waste of human life sadly these evil sobs will probably never face justice the media and the government will just whitewash this incident and chalk it up as being solely david koresh s fault sadder still the american people will probably believe them next question the problem is of course the laws that allow a bunch of raving nutters to collect a huge stack of arms in the first place this is not the problem the problem is that we have a government that is becoming more tyrannical every day if people decide to own guns and live in one place together then that is their prerogative on the other hand if the bds were in posession of explosives and illegal guns then the government did have the right to search their compound but the allegations that the bds were in posession of illegal weapons hasn t been proven yet so i m not going to conclude that the bds broke any laws david koresh was accused of abusing children but if this is his only crime then the presence of the atf can t be justified the atf is only supposed to deal with firearms tobacco and alcohol violations atf agents are basically cigarette cops they should stay out of other kinds of law enforcement actions that are out of their jurisdiction better yet they should be s tcanned imo the sequence of events meant that there really was no option but to attempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervention if the fbi had had the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando type raid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the adults sounds like something the ss would do human life children and adults alike should be treated with respect even if they are heavily armed religious wackos david koresh s lawyer seemed to think that everyone would come out peacefully sooner or later the fbi and atf had nothing but time on their hands why did they have to escalate the situation and cause this senseless tragedy their job is to protect the public and save lives not kill people for crying out loud it really was a no win situation koresh had plenty of opportunity to give up and stand trial for the murder of the atf officers instead he ordered the murder of the children don t be so sure about that i read in a newspaper today that one of the cult members said that when one of the tanks went through the wall that it knocked over a lantern which caused the ranch house to be caught on fire this cult member also said that david koresh had no intentions of committing mass suicide david koresh s lawyer also confirms this therefore if this is true then this means that the fbi and atf murdered everyone in that house even if this is not true the fbi and atf still don t get off the hook because they waited a damn long time to call the waco fire department perhaps they wanted all these people to die in order to reject the word of the fbi and batf it is neccessary to beleive the words of a man who has just murdered children and ordered the suicide murder of his other followers according to the account given the batf attempted to serve a warrant upon koresh at the ranch and were met by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them the koresh gun supporter claim that the batf started shooting simply does not stand up if the aft had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier grade weaponry than standard issue handguns for all practical purposes they were unarmed the b d followers had automatic weapons you re wrong on several accounts atf agents were adequately armed they had mp s ar s and shotguns some agents were armed with automatic pistols but not all were the atf s initial claim which they later retracted that agents were underarmed is simply ludicrous the b d seige could not be allowed to go on indefinitely the b d were quite capable of commiting mass suicide and murdering the children at any time a commando assault was the only other likely action that could have achieved that objective that would have been very risky orders of magintude harder than antebbe or the iranian embassy seige airplanes and embassies are not designed for defense against attack ranch apocalypse was terrorists are far easier to disloge without casualties than allowing the siege to go on was not an option either besides the serious risk that koresh would proclaim armageddon at any moment there was the question of the difficulties of keeping the emmergency team on standby over a prolonged period the longer the siege went on the more mentally prepared koresh and his followers would be for a prolonged siege rather than go in prematurely the mistake was probably to go in too soon can you think of a better way of getting the children out a certain way the people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire government story this is simply rationalisation it is not enough for them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent that would require them to come up with a solution themselves instead they have to come up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to set out to murder people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them to get gun control legislation through gun control isn t the only issue here if the sick little monkeys in washington try to use the waco incident as a reason to ban guns then they will have demonstrated just how f ed up they are what concerns me much more than new gun control legislation is that the government seems to be able to get away with s t like they did in waco they are becoming more and more callous about people s rights and the law this greatly disturbs me and it should disturb you as well this conspiracy theory assumes that the batf deliberately got of its agents killed and that the fbi etc actually enjoy sitting out in the middle of texas being shot at by religious nutters still the conspiracy theory is comforting it allows them to pretend that waco proves nothing except about how incompetent the government is in resolving a hostage crisis no govt in the world has ever faced a comparable situation quite probably there was no manner in which it could be peacefully resolved the blame does not rest on the fbi it rests on the fact that koresh was allowed to get so far in particular the person who tipped the b d off in advance has the murder of atf agents and children on his or her conscience there are a large number of people in the us who predict the end of society preach salvation through armed security the fact is that these are the very people who pose the threat to society in the first place the next waco may not be religious nutters but a political movement a splinter group of the klu klux klan taking over a schoolhouse in a black area for example and holding several hundred children hostage the only possible solution to such situations that can work is to prevent them arising no other government in the world has faced such a situation this is because no other government has so carelessly allowed high power weaponry to become avaliable to any little hitler or would be messiah to set themselves up as dictator in

anybody s house ok let me correct my unfortunate choice of words i just hope that the law enforcement agencies keep your attitude in mind the next time your wife is gang raped by a bunch of juvenile drug dealing thugs while she was jogging in the park no strike that etc the batf came out with horse trailers men ninja uniforms machine guns and stun grenades and used them before koresh could even look at the warrant koresh fought back and people died the key part of this sentense is koresh fought back this was his big mistake when the police decide to exert their authority over you you don t fight back unless you want people to get hurt you cease all resistance and signal your submission to their authority the cops they are the boss you are the subject the concept of defense against illegal action under color of law is kaput no longer is it government of the people by the people its government of the people by the biggest guns the idea of sorting it out in court later is fine but one has to get to court in one piece to do that korash had good reason to think that he was not going to get that chance see below aren t in it to beat up and kill people in spite of the actions of a few bad apples if you quit resisting they quit hitting perhaps the batf did over react to the threat posed by koresh perhaps they did use too much force ok fine i m willing to concede to that point if sufficient proof is produced and i admit that there is some evidence to indicate this however resisting the batf is the worst thing koresh could have done if they hadn t resisted there is a good chance that no one would have been hurt remeber they were using stun grenades not anti personnel grenades if the bds were not in violation of any rember korash didn t get to sort this all out serenely typing at his keyboard he heard some kind of explosives go off he saw he was being attacked with no overt action from him yet he could no more say oh its ok its only stun grenades anymore than i could he slammed the door at that point and proceeded to repel the attackers he felt in genuine fear of his life i know i would be in fear of my life at that point have you ever been shot at how clear and logically could you think under that pressure when you might have all of or seconds to evaluate what is going on and it would not be the first time that law enforcements intended to bring in their suspect horizontally for all we know he was informed by someone saying something like hey guy the batf is coming like gangbusters and they mean to waste you according to the latest news the released warrant so we are told said the reason for this ww iii raid was that korash s group had spent around on firearms and related stuff over an undetermined period now even assuming that the figure isn t calculated like the feds do a drug siezure for people that isn t really all that much you priced decent guns lately hell i can think of a person right now that probably has that much for one individual mostly machineguns sure he is an avid collector but unless a new law has been passed it is not illegal nor an indication of anything illegal to have a lot of guns also note that the warrant had nothing to say about machine guns so what is the justification of this cowboy raid other than a romp gone bad for some anti gun media hype to support clinton s push for disarming the unconnected citizen of any and all effective defensive weapons this administration has only one thing in mind control people control whether it is gun control clinton cripple chip national smart id cards it all boils down to people control can you say only years late i knew you could laws they would have been released as they had been before if this had happened and it turned out that the batf had used too much force then the bds would have grounds for a law suit and for federal charges of civil rights violations sounds a lot like la huh don t take that wrong i m not commenting one way or the other about the rodney king case but that s not what they wanted they got tipped off that the batf was on the way in and rather than adopting a non violent non threatening posture to greet the batf they decided to fight and batf knew the bds were expecting them via minutes report but they decided they were so big so bad they would have a cakewalk at the bds expense for a nice media show anyway but it all turned to shit and the fbi taking over to manage things we see it all turned to shit too clinton says i am taking full responsibility bah responsibility means to take the repercussions if it goes wrong bet you nobody pays any serious repercussions responsibility only has meaning as media pr or as a means to corner the average joe schmoe figure it out clinton reno the fbi and batf will all be immune can you say whitewash i ve said enough of this issue i m probably not going to convince any of you folks and you re certainly not going to convince me i ve got work to do don be very afraid of

buyback programs will hopefully have an impact on accidental shootings especially youths domestic disputes where a gun is available in the heat of emotion and anger and maybe keep a few guns from being stolen and later used in street level crime what gives you the idea that gun buyback programs will have an impact on any of these things evidence please please don t misinterret what i was saying joe i was making the point tha there is no evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types of common incidents if you re a research associate in urban child research then perhaps you can comment for us on the ratio of the accidental gun death rate to the rate of accidental death from other single causes follow that perhaps with some sort of justification for the amount of effort that anti gunners spend trying to convince the country that accidental gun related death among children in the u s is a serious problem firearms are the fifth leading cause of unintentional deaths among children ages and under i don t understand how the ratio to other accidental deaths is important so guns don t kill as many children as car accidents what is the difference in severity between deaths and deaths i am not trying to use accidental gun related deaths among children as a justification for gun control who needs to be convinced that accidental gun deaths of children is a serious problem i assumed that any humane person would be concerned when any year old got hold of their parents gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends any death is serious wanna discuss match control firearms related unintentional deaths among children ages and under are the fault of one or more negligent persons not the gun more than anything gun buyback programs are symbolic offerings to the community in that sense i think they might do a little good please explain why you think symbolic offerings do good my point was gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police departments might i stress might do a little i stress little good by giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way overall i thought that i had made it clear that i did not think that gun buyback programs were useful providing false hope then is the intent i do know that the vast majority of guns that are used by youths or brought to school by youths on a daily basis about youths are obtained easily and quickly through a personal friend or more often borrowed from a parent without their knowledge i suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these statistics i suspect you ll find if you look carefully that is the number of students estimated to have carried a weapon not necessarily a gun to school at least once in the past year and not the number of students who carry a gun to school daily well joe i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence or the centers for disease control if you look carefully you will see that you greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths the cphv reports that youth bring guns to school daily and that bring guns to school at least once a year the cdc estimates that out f high school students carried a gun to school at least once in the cdc also says that million elementary aged latch key children kids who come home from school to an empty house have access to guns in their home california schools reported a increase in student gun confiscations between and and a increase between and florida reported a percent increase in gun incidents in schools between amd these are the statistics increase in california schools eh gun control is working fine there thus willing to follow a man who claimed to be the messiah got news for you folks if the big cheese was on this crazy planet of ours presently he would not be carrying a gun or holding children when they were in danger holding kids time for a reality check son these kids were the children of the people inside who believed that the forces of evil were outside waiting to kill them would you send your children out the door if you believed as they did okay maybe i worded it wrong dad i meant that to put children in a situation fortified compound where harm could come to them is not the act of a messiah in my opinion i m not saying that koresh had control over these children directly but i would hope that whatever messiah there is would not let innocent children die if as he claimed he was the messiah and people followed him as such why did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them burn alive thanks for the reality check joe its been real

re ammo in a fire was re waco burning bressler iftccu ca boeing com rick bressler writes small arms rounds set off outside of a firearm pose little risk except possibly eye injuries and minor wounds true large concentrations of ammo or magazines not the type you insert into your semi auto probably pose a larger risk but mostly from heat and flame this is also covered in the above reference no more risk than smaller stashes unless the stash is somehow confined so the heat from early ignitions could somehow bulk heat the remainder two years ago this month my house and office burned in my office was my reloading bench on the top shelf next to the wooden ceiling was about lbs of smokeless powder lbs of black powder several thousand primers and a couple thousand loaded rounds primarily in acp and the fire was extinguished before the area containing the reloading supplies were fully involved there was about of char on the joists subsequently removed by sandblasting lots of heat in other words none of the powder kegs ignited one lb can of pistol powder ignited no explosion as the can opened at the seam as it was designed to do the black powder cans were charred and got so hot the plastic lids completely melted and ran down inside the smokless powder was contained mostly in lb cardboard or metal kegs the kegs were charred badly enough that the paper labels burned completely off and in the case of the metal cans the plastic lids melted completely away many of the rounds cooked off they were in close proximity to wood on all sides so the effects were easy to observe in most cases with the rifle ammo the cartridge cases ruptured in the middle many bullets were found still in the neck small shards of brass were lightly stuck into the wood lightly enough that brushing them with a fingertip would usually dislodge them primers generally popped out of the primer pockets the acp rounds that cooked off left empty cases and bullets laying around no dents were observed above the storage area indicating the bullets left the cases slowly enough not to be a hazard ordinary small arms ammo is not a hazard when cooking off regardless of what the fbi says john john de armond wd oqc interested in high performance mobility performance engineering magazine tm interested in high tech and computers marietta ga send ur snail mail address to jgd dixie com perform dixie com for a free sample mag lee harvey oswald where are ya when we need ya
re the truth about waco dhartung chinet chi il us dan hartung writes massive dan blather mercifully deleted his last sentence says it all who the hell are we or the government to judge their religion as wrong this event i hope will be recorded in history as the american holocaust these people were murdered by the us government just as surely as the jews were by the nazis i hang my head in shame for what i ve allowed my government to become i have never judged them by their religion but by their actions if they had lived a quiet religious life as they claimed there would have been no raid no siege and no deaths instead they chose courses of action at every turn that were at the very least stupid if not irrational the first was to stockpile weapons the second was to shoot federal agents the third was to stay inside last time i checked amassing an arsenal and practicing any kind of religion were mentioned in passing in the bill of rights guess it s ok with you if we just brush em aside in order to justify killing a bunch of religious nutcakes eh of all the idiots i run into in daily life dan your type scare me the most you ll accept expediency and a coward s safety over any belief just as long as the government tells you to you assume that anyone who doesn t comform to your beliefs and ways of thinking are wrong and therefore bad worse you seem to accept without question what the government says is wrong to be wrong david koresh s religion was not mine but then again neither are the baptists methodists catholics or any of the rest of the corporate religions but even though koresh s the baptists the methodists etc don t believe the same way i do i recognize that their religions are equally valid to mine and more importantly are equally protected under the st amendment you see i m not that much different than koresh and i suspect many others fit the same catagory i read the bible many times and as i learned from it i discovered that a lot of what corporate religions practice just isn t justified by my interpretation of the bible therefore i go my own way so did koresh and neither you nor i nor anyone else either individually or collectively as the great socialist we has any right whatsoever to tell me or you or koresh that our religions are wrong you seem to think that it would have been oh so easy for the davidians to just forsake everything they believed in and walk out of their compound in order to save themselves think if you re capable for a moment about some belief you hold dearest would you abandon that belief if suddenly told to do so by the government if you would do so you are beneath contempt let s assume you have a belief that you hold dear enough to commit your life to do you think it would be the correct course of action for your government to initiate actions specifically designed to force you to make that forsake or die decision the forsake or die option is exactly what the government forced on the davidians the day the first wave of black clad stormtroopers fired that first shot and tossed that first grenade the fbi clenched it on day when they sent in heavy armor against some odd men women and children holed up in a rickety old building and armed with small arms the people who stayed who held to their beliefs over personal safety whose individual personal honors demanded they die rather than submit who believed that the bill of rights meant exactly what it says to those people go my deepest respect regardless of their religion people like you who blithely blow off the murder of people with well they could have come out get my most scornful contempt i d spit in your face were there not a network between us you re not worth the ashes of those people who burned john john de armond wd oqc interested in high performance mobility performance engineering magazine tm interested in high tech and computers marietta ga send ur snail mail address to jgd dixie com perform dixie com for a free sample mag lee harvey oswald where are ya when we need ya

re who s next mormons and jews from article r mhtinna cronkite central sun com by dbernard clesun central sun com dave bernard does that include the right to murder little children how about killing atf officers i do not know much about the gun laws in texas but koresh s folks claimed to have grenades grenade launchers and rocket launchers i am not sure that the nra feels that this falls under right to bear arms if the waco wackos truly had grenade launchers and rocket launchers why weren t they used against the armored vehicles that attacked their house all the media stated was that small arms ie ineffective fire was used against them i noticed that too special agent asshole actually ricks stated that david koresh had explosives that could blow up an armored vehicle feet into the air it looked like to me that the bds had plenty of opportunity to use these explosives provided that they had them in the first place for example when one of the tanks was injecting cs gas into the ranch house yes ranch house the bds weren t living in a fortress they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because it was idling there for a considerable length of time so why didn t they do this could it be that they didn t have any explosives or similar munitions i just don t buy what the atf and fbi have been saying hopefully the truth will come out here s something noteworthy after the fire had been burning for some time an explosion occurred just one explosion the media said that this was some of the explosives that the bds posessed going off i don t think this was the case my brother and i noticed that this so called explosion resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited we figure that this is what it was because of how the explosion looked and sounded obviously it wasn t due to something like tnt dynamite or c i have seen a propane explosion before the explosion in the ranch house greatly resembled this also i noticed something that looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day isn t it curious that the atf wasn t very forthcoming about how the four officers got killed many weeks had gone by before they stated that some of the officers had been killed and or wounded by grenades thrown by the bds earlier when someone asked one of the spokespersons about whether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents they said that an autopsy had been done but they weren t ready to release the findings now why is this does the atf have something to hide perhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire what is the cause of death exactly no one has ever said what it is what is certain is this atf agents did throw grenades into the compound as a matter of fact mr koresh handed his lawyer a grenade body during one of the lawyer s visits to the compound later on the lawyer gave the grenade body i don t know if it was a dud or a spent one btw to the atf how much do you want to bet that this grenade will mysteriously disappear at this point in time the only people we know who had grenades was the atf agents wouldn t it be a shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades rockets or explosives in the rubble the atf would sure have egg on their face then note that the atf is doing the initial sweep of the rubble the fbi and the texas rangers won t investigate until the atf is done this looks like a perfect opportunity for the atf to make sure that others find what they want for them to find if you know what i mean i m probably being a little paranoid here but if i am i have could reason to be recall that several weeks had gone by before anyone said that the bds had used grenades also recall that early on the atf had denied that their agents used grenades on the bds someone is lying here scott kennedy brewer and patriot before david koresh is a cheap thug who interprets the bible through the barrel of a gun atf spokesman after the atf is a cheap thug who interprets the constitution through the barrel of a gun me

batf fbi do right thing in waco everyone is complaining about the debacle in waco it is hard to understand all this angst what happend there is nothing less than what we wanted to happen why all the sour grapes batf was looking for a propaganda event to counteract their impending budget cuts the attendance of the press at the initial big commando raid is proof it would have been ever so easier to grab koresh and his central followers as they shopped in waco alas no propaganda value there the fbi screwed up big time all the time they should have never allowed the situation to drag out like that a quick second assault before the bds could decide on a strategy would have been the better plan the bds themselves were the biggest screw ups though they imagined that us law and us law enforcement had no jurisdiction within their little country wrong they had no right whatsoever to fire on the batf and if they mistook their identity initially they should have surrendered at once when they did realize who they were if the bds had a problem with the warrants they take it to court just like the rest of us if they wanted full auto weapons they could have obtained the proper permits just like the rest of us would need to do what they may not do is decide for themselves what us law applies to themselves and which does not they get their chance like the rest of us at the voting booth if the batf and fbi have become latter day gestapo then they have become that way because we have desired them to be so we get to vote on laws and on the lawmakers by our choices over the years we have approved the creation and form of the batf and fbi when the fbi was out chasing pinkos the general public didn t seem to mind a bit of extra constitutional activity when the batf is raiding militant black organizations we don t mind the heavy hand when the fbi is dicking around with the rights of potheads the public doesn t mind suddenly when we see a bit of ourselves in the current enemy choosen by these agencies we get all bent out of shape suprise you reap what you sow waco was an encapsulation of the all american experience religious fanaticism militaristic thinking and overwhelming violence don t blame it on them the fbi and batf they were just acting within the parameters we have set over the years we made them we are them jim mason

re my gun is like my american express card in article apr csd newshost stanford edu andy sail stanford edu andy freeman says this is where freeman s love of accuracy becomes really ridiculous good now let s look at those sections they ll prove my point his point was that it is possible under certain circumstances for many people to carry concealed in illinois a a person commits the offense of unlawful use of weapons when he knowingly carries or possesses in any vehicle or concealed on or about his person except when on his land or in his own abode or fixed place of business any pistol revolver stun gun or taser or other firearm note that this doesn t affect all concealed carry look after the word except it always helps to read the law before commenting on it i did read the law before i commented on it judging from replies i received about my semantics on t p g post many if not most people here on t p g assume that when ccw laws are asked about the person is asking about the possibility of an ordinary citizen getting one it would also follow that said person would get the ccw to carry on his her person away from their home and or business would a prudent storekeeper carry concealed how about someone at home note that both are legal and a lot of common people qualify for one or the other andy maybe freeman did prove his point but his point is not relevant the thing that most people seem to care about when they ask questions about carrying a concealed weapon is whether or not they can carry it concealed on their person when they are out on the street somewhere i m sure that not many people are concerned with whether or not they can carry concealed at home speaking as someone who lives in illinois the only place where the above quoted law is relevant i know that it is legal to own a handgun here i am not taking into account city ordinances i could care less about whether or not i can carry concealed at home i only care about the fact that i can t carry concealed in the place where it really counts out on the street freeman loves to be accurate and i can understand that especially not but he seems to be forgetting that accurate facts don t always replace common sense i am not going to followup to this thread anymore because i believe that it is useless to argue these points anymore the only thing that is happening now is that freeman and i are running around in circles trying to prove each other wrong and i do not have the time to be playing games anymore of course now freeman will attack me about my use of common sense in some of my earlier posts but what can i do my only advice for freeman quit being so picky about accuracy sometimes and use your common sense it really does work some times jason u uicvm cc uic edu

re guns amex and new name thomas parsli thomasp ifi uio no writes remember me tom i hope you ll respond and i seem to be a voice of reason or some such i ve been recieving fan mail so naturally my ego is somehwat inflated of late and hope to make a few points here i have never spoken for a ban against guns in america what i ve said is that there seems to be to many of them and especially to many in wrong hands and our argument is that you cannot remove them from the people who need restricting and not remove them from the people who don t a fairly simple problem given our size and numbers do you agree we all believe criminals particularly violent criminals should not have firearms the problem is making a law that does this without trodding upon the rights of the vast majority nobody here seems to be able to do it and i doubt anybody in norway can either thus we are left with a philosophical difference does the safety of a few justify restricting the many we say no while others say yes now if you would like to reduce the number how would you do it without affecting good responcible gun owners can you provide a method that cannot be abused i doubt it i do believe in a persons freedom what i don t believe is that you can have it all and don t pay for it of course this is not in contention what is in contention is how much one has to pay most europeans believe in a society of individuals and that you have to give a little to make that society work it is this giving a little that makes americans wary we have seen this argument before you might remember how a chamberlain gave a little to a particular fascist short asshole and how such appeasement worked while it might work in some instances it doesn t work in others and since we cannot predict the future we must be cautious in using actions that have a history of failure cars and guns should really not be mixed i just tried to make a point like america norway has some spaces you have to cross to get from a to b so a car is essential in most parts guns on the other hand are not essential in norway so we don t argue that if we banned guns we have to ban cars cars are not essential in norway any more than they are in the usa i m willing to bet that you have neighbors that would be willing to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a price thus cars are not essential for your transportation however the arguments presented show that since cars are used to kill far more people than guns in the usa it makes much more sense to restrict cars than it does guns how one defines essential often depends upon what one is willing to go through for that service when we look at the raw data such comparisons are not individually weighed everyone who believe that hitler and ww could be avoided if there were more guns in germany in the s please read some history this depends upon what the populace was willing to do as desert storm proved even an armed populace won t just revolt even when given a chance still would hitler have done all that he did with an armed populace we have to wonder as some of his first acts were to confiscate firearms other points in history show that dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the populace thus we re left wondering if hitler would have been overthrown or if king george was just unlucky in keeping the usa as a colony one can argue both sides one also has to live with each action is this discussion about banning weapons for all americans or making it harder for criminals to get one it is about but so far all proposals to curtail have wound up enforcing as well i only wish that or was so logical change of name that was on my part purely in jest i merely pointed out how we were from similar backgrounds racially but of wholly different backgrounds politically i thought this would underscore my point on how our cultures were so different despite similar heritage did the batf get the warrant for a gun search only or was there other reasons child abuse for instance batf can only enforce gun tobaccco alcohol violations child abuse is a matter for the individual states and local authorities doesn t the people reading this newsgroup have access to the clari news hierarcy some seems rather mis uninformed that hierarchy is a paid for feed at many sites most people do not get it for this reason and i suspect money not censorship is the main reason do you get alt sex at your site i can t read it here because of censorship and legal fears so again our differences show you have topless sunbathing and in the usa we can watch a murder every fifteen seconds and yet breasts are forbidden on television dan sorenson dod z dan exnet iastate edu viking iastate edu isu only censors what i read not what i say don t blame them usenet post to exotic distant machines meet exciting unusual people and flame them

re atf burns dividian ranch no survivors as quoted from nate psygate psych indiana edu by nate psygate psych indiana edu nathan engle what did those people do wrong in the first place that is what i can t figure out they assembled a frightening arsenal of weapons by circumventing laws which were intended to prevent such a buildup then later they used some of those weapons to kill representatives of the federal government i m sure they were frightened when they saw all those batf officers closing in but in retrospect i can t see how their subsequent gunfight could be expected to improve the situation what laws did they circumvent being frightening isn t a crime some people are afraid of young black males that doesn t make the mere status of being a young black male a crime the batf itself admitted leading off by throwing handgrenades there is no evidence that they properly identified themselves as law enforcement personnel under those circumstances other persons have been found to be acting within their legal rights to exercise self defense against unidentified armed intruders at this point i place little or no credibility on any of the charges of child abuse or molestation but i would remind you that the branch davidians aren t the only ones burying their dead the charges are irrlevant anyway since the batf has absolutely no jurisdiction in such matters anyway of course that hasn t stopped them from making other such spurious charges such as the existence of mythical meth labs of course they whole cult thing indicates the level of contempt that they have for the st amendment sure they were crazy no dought about it but what did they do wrong they attempted to stage an armed resistance to federal authorities under conditions that placed dozens of unarmed and innocent people in the line of fire that armed resistance at least initially may well have been legal you re like a bunch of over educated new york jewish aclu lawyers fighting to eliminate school prayer from the public schools in arkansas holly silva

re gun buy back on thu apr gmt r vmcms csuohio edu wrote firearms are the fifth leading cause of unintentional deaths among children ages and under from the rkba archive rkba total firearm deaths for children through at is one of the smallest causes of deaths in children cars falls burns drowning food ingestion are all much larger cause of deaths so firearms are the th leading cause after drowning and choking on food at least for sorry charles according to the national safety council accident facts in gun accidents were the fifth leading cause of accidental death for children ages and under i don t understand how the ratio to other accidental deaths is important so guns don t kill as many children as car accidents what is the difference in severity between deaths and deaths the difference is that a rational person would address the leading cause first and address the lesser causes later that thinking is so screwed up i don t even know how to respond to it a rational person would concentrate on motor vehicle deaths and not attempt to affect childhood falls drownings gunshot injuries etc so this so called rational person using your definition if he or she were attempting to affect the leading causes of deaths for adults aged through would only worry about cancer and would not try to decrease lesser causes such as heart disease injuries stroke suicide liver disease chronic lung disease homicide hiv infection or diabetes oh okay charles that makes a lot of sense i tell you what charles i ll call the heart foundation and suicide hotlines and tell them that they are not acting rational and that they can all go home because they are addressing the lesser causes of death and you call your local police homicide department liver foundation and diabetes foundation and tell them to stop addressing these lesser causes please quit wasting my time with this silly shit charles i ve got an idea charles why don t you start a talk politics caraccidents group or talk politics fall group this is talk politics guns don t confuse the issue just because a social problem may not claim as many victims as another we should not try to address it i don t agree i m not posting to t p g to debate the supposed severity of causes of childhood deaths i am really getting frigging sick of having to respond to the irrational statements of people who assume that someone who wants to discuss youth gun violence or unintentional youth gun deaths is trying to make a political issue out of it i assumed that any humane person would be concerned when any year old got hold of their parents gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends a humane person who keeps a firearm in the house with a year old would also teach this child how to safely handle the firearm ignorance is our greatest enemy again charles you tend to confuse the issue and take things out of context for your own purposes the statement that you responded to above is actually in reference to a previous post by another person who like you expressed concern over making youth gun violence a priority i guess maybe humane person and rational person could be interchangeable huh both would be defined as a person who only addresses the social problem that causes the greatest number of childhood deaths if that is the case i m extremely glad that i am inhumane and irrational well joe i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence what other sources of information do you have which confirms their data these folks are well known for misrepresenting the facts perhaps you can verify their data with the uniform crime report sorry charles the fbi uniform crime report is well known for misrepresenting the facts but if you insist according to the ucr firearm murders of youngsters and under increased percent between and is the national center for health statistics good enough for you they state that every day american children ages and under are killed in gun accidents suicides and homicides many more are wounded or how about the national pediatric trauma registry they say gunshot wounds to children ages and under nearly doubled in major urban areas between and do you also doubt the american academy of pediatrics charles they state that gunshot wounds among children in urban areas increased from to charles i hope you don t need to be convinced that youth are increasingly victims of gun injuries and that they have easy access to guns if you don t realize this fact i don t care if you go by cdc or fbi data or if you go into the homes schools and streets where these kids are and take a poll by yourself i m not going to bother to try to convince you its obvious that you have ruled out any idea of discussing this issue in a sane fashion and that you are so focused on trying to make this a gun control and political discussion i really don t want to do that or the centers for disease control they have firearm statistics are firearms a disease charles it s obvious that you know nothing about the cdc they don t just study cancer and heart disease i ve got news for you interpersonal gun violence is an epidemic in surgeon general c everett koop declared that gun violence is as much a public health problem as cancer heart disease or auto accidents that you greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths in the lives of youths or in their schools i know a number of youths who have firearms present in their lives is is quite appropriate to teach children to safely handle firearms this is a presence right what are you trying to say this innuendo reminds me of listening to bill clinton who the f k said anything about teaching children to safely handle firearm charles in the future if you are going to post to t p g and jump into a previous discussion please read the entire posting not just sentence that you decide to respond to what the hell are you saying here you re wasting time and space trying to make a political and gun control issue out of a discussion that isn t the cphv reports that youth bring guns to school daily and that bring guns to school at least once a year i wouldn t trust their statistics without independent verification the cdc estimates that out f high school students carried a gun to school at least once in based on cphv statistics based on ucr based on what the cdc also says that million elementary aged latch key children kids who come home from school to an empty house have access to guns in their home therefore what is the purpose of this claim charles buddy i m getting really tired of this do you live on the planet mars as a physicist i realize that you probably don t come into contact with many youth but i really think you need to make a trip to your local urban high school and discover the joy of guns in schools in addition spend a few minutes talking to these kids ask them if they have ever heard gunshots in their neighborhoods whether they know anyone who has been shot whether they know anyone who has a gun whether they have ever held a gun and whether they themselves have ever been shot believe me charles that will be your independent verification rodney w thomas r vmcms csuohio edu urban child research center cleveland state university cleveland oh

re final solution for gaza the honest answer to your question about arabs who were expelled from jaffa and or who fled jaffa or anywhere else in israel having the right to return is yes unfortunately they have the right to return they may apply for citizenship like any other non israeli and then go to jaffa and try to buy their house back from the jews who now own it and now a question and answer for you can the jews who were born and raised in hebron or their descendants go back to their homes in hebron the answer is absolutely not because they were almost all murdered by their arab neighbors the palestinians now do i think the arabs should be allowed to even visit their homes in jaffa hell no bring back the jews of hebron petah tikva jerusalem safed etc then perhaps i would be in favor of arabs returning to their jaffa homes however seeing as no arab has yet been able to bring people back from the dead i d say that s out with all the hope in the world nissan ratzlav katz nraclaw jade tufts edu

re his book was dealing with the genocide of muslims by armenians in article zanikos sfu ca zanikos kits sfu ca dimitrios zanikos writes you make it sound as if the turks are as inocent as a teenaged virgin about to get married go and read about the atrocities commited by the turks against the greeks during the period of time greece was occupied by the turks now you expect that turks living in greece should be treated like so the greek educational system is also in a shambles history shows that within the last years greeks played that game twice they used istanbul patriarch grigorios in to instigate the morea rebellion that resulted in the massacres of the muslim people again the orthodox patriarch constantine v invited the russian czar nicholas ii to invade the ottoman empire in the name of jesus and save his flock from ottoman rule source the past in medieval and modern greek culture in speros vryonis ed byzantina kai metabyzantina vol i malibu calif p in the words of professor skiotis with savage jubilance the greeks sang the words let no turk remain in the morea nor in the whole world the greeks were determined to achieve to romaiko in the only way they knew how through a war of religious extermination let me further improve this one for you after the ottoman empire lost world war i the british landed in a greek army in izmir to exterminate the people of turkiye are you suffering from a severe case of amnesia the tired and defeated turks rose up formed a national force under the leadership of mustafa kemal and on august they annihilated the bulk of the greek army now wait there is more the greek war of independence brought disaster to the jewish communities in the peloponnesos where the revolution erupted in the jews because of their close association with the ottoman administration were massacred along with the turks the jewish communities of mistras tripolis and kalamata were decimated the few survivors moved north to settle in chalkis and volos still under ottoman rule patras lost its ancient jewish community which was refounded only in nikos stavroulakis athens auschwitz page ix source professor stanford j shaw the jews of the ottoman empire and the turkish republic new york university press new york page the disintegration of the ottoman empire which had been going on for a century was disastrous for ottoman jewry this was the age of nationalism among the christian subjects of the sultan starting with the greek revolution early in the nineteenth century which based on the megali idea or great idea sought to add to greek kingdom istanbul and large portions of anatolia union of which with greece was felt to be the dream and hope of all the success of the greek national movement provided more in fact by the intervention of the great powers than by the efforts of the greeks themselves stimulated similar uprisings among the other subjects in southeastern europe who had long been oppressed not so much by the ottomans but rather by the greek religious hierarchy which dominated the orthodox millet leading first to pressure for religious independence granted to the bulgarian orthodox exarchate in to the serbian church in and to the rumanian church in with subsequent aspirations for and achievement of political independence following page they new nationalist leaders were greatly assisted in their campaigns against the ottomans both by the diplomatic and consular representatives of the major powers of europe and also by christian missionaries who emphasized feelings of christian superiority and hatred for muslims and jews which fortified the religious as well as ethnic bases of their pursuit of independence christian nationalism based as much on religious as on ethnic identity soon resurrected the medieval bigotries which had devastated both jews and muslims and consequently had driven them together in the past vicious anti muslim and anti semitic movements developed involving large scale persecutions and massacres carried out by invading armies by the independent states that resulted also by christian subjects who remained within the empire particularly because of jewish and muslim support for ottoman integrity in fear of their fate in the emergent nationalist states of southeastern europe the results were explosive and damaging the invading armies of russia and austria as well as the revolting nationalists and later successfully established independent christian states committed systematic genocide against jews and muslims throughout the nineteenth century despite great power admonitions to the contrary in the treaties of paris and berlin page as the peoples of southeastern europe achieved their independence their muslim and jewish minorities were systematically persecuted and massacred and those who survived were driven beyond the ever shrinking boundaries of the retreating ottoman empire in a kind of slaughter which had not been seen since the dispersal of the jews from palestine centuries earlier this sort of genocide had begun as long before as the late sixteenth century with the rumanian principalities taking the lead as united rumania did subsequently during the later years of the nineteenth century in the ruler of moldavia peter the lame banished its jews because of their competition with its christian merchants when prince micheal the brave revolted against the ottomans in the rumanian principalities of wallachia and moldavia in he ordered the massacre of all the jews as well as turks in bucharest page the slaughter continued well into the nineteenth century when the greeks revolted against ottoman rule many greek volunteers coming from russia and the principalities to join in the effort slaughtered and plundered the jewish communities along their paths as they went through moldavia and wallachia toward greece page second paragraph when venice occupied the island of chios in its jewish population was either massacred or deported and all jewish communal and personal property was stolen by the native greek population leaving those jews who returned in utter poverty and reduced to begging no longer able to compete with the greeks in trade or commerce page third paragraph jews living in greece and the rumanian principalities suffered terribly because of their support for ottoman rule when the greek nationalist movement philike etairia started its uprising in wallachia and moldavia during the spring of hundreds of jews and muslims were killed by the greeks who lived there as well as by native wallachs during the height of the greek revolution five thousand jews were massacred in morea along with most of the muslim population numbering about twenty thousand in all in tripolizza alone jews were massacred along with uncounted turks reverend john hartley after describing the carnage concluded thus did jewish blood mingled with turkish flow down the streets of captured city the sons of isaac and the sons of ishmael on this as well as on every occasion during the greek revolution met with common fate their corpses were cast out of the city and like the ancient sovereign of judah they received no burial superior to that of an ass jewish communities on the islands of sparta patras corinthos mistra and argos were wiped out by bands of greek rebels along with those of thebes vrachori attica and epirus the surviving jews fled to the island of corfu where jews who had fled from italy and the iberian peninsula had lived in peace and prosperity under the venetian rule since the twelfth century though divided into rival greek and italian communities it was not long however before it too fell victim to the greek revolution leading to savage repression and massacres of jews forcing the surviving members of the two communities to come together for self defense for the first time throughout the years of greek revolution greek nationalists went from town to town on the mainland and from island to island in the agean exterminating all the jews and muslims they could find many along the roads as they desperately fled to safety in what was left of the ottoman empire contemporary accounts relate that the greeks left the murdered jews and muslims lying exposed so their bodies could be torn apart by the buzzards most of the jews who survived these massacres fled across the agean in small boats to izmir thus starting its rise as one of the leading centers of ottoman jewish life during the nineteenth century only in northern greece particularly in the areas of janina and salonica were the jews and the turks able to successfully resist the greek assaults thus saving their populations from massacre as well during the remainder of the th century particularly during the greek turkish war in those jews who remained in greece in the areas of athens chalkis larissa corfu and crete suffered severe persecution and massacre forcing thousands more to emigrate into ottoman territory particularly to salonica and izmir page last paragraph the inclusion in the treaty of berlin of stipulations providing protection for the jewish and muslim minorities in southeastern europe stimulated more popular anti semitic and anti muslim hysteria in all the countries involved with blood libel accusations once again being used as pretexts for attacking and ravaging jewish quarters as well as for new tactics for boycotting jewish shopkeepers merchants and professionals a movement which was quickly adapted by the christian millets in the major cities of the ottoman empire because the bulgarians rumanians and greeks correctly regarded the jews as supporters of the turks both jews and turks were expelled from these countries in equally atrocious and brutal manners their property was plundered and their homes and shops taken over without compensation while the survivors fled in desperation to edirne and istanbul while official statements subsequently were issued granting equal rights to jews little was done in fact and they continued to be persecuted regularly well into the twentieth century page last paragraph things were not much better elsewhere in southeastern europe or the greek islands of the agean and the eastern mediterranean in the jews on corfu were subjected to severe persecution by local greeks due to the revival of the old ritual murder accusations many of those who survived found refuge in ottoman territory with the help of a popular subscription drive carried out in istanbul under leadership of the banque camondo in and and again in and thousands of jews came to ottoman territory as a result of pogroms in russia which went on between and with only slight periods of respite in jewish families arrived in istanbul in flight from persecution in vidin in independent bulgaria the conquest of ottoman thrace and macedonia by greek and bulgarian forces during the balkan wars including salonica corlu and edirne was followed by general attacks on jews their synagogues homes and shops in both countries resulting in a renewed exodus toward istanbul and beyond two reports from salonica graphically described the situation caused by the invading armies all the self interested justifications of the newspapers of europe all the lies which they have used to cover up the truth can never destroy the impression of the terrible anguish which has marked the entry of the greeks in salonica a week of terror and horror one can never easily forget the hellenes now cruelly feel today all the damage that the explosion of hatred by the greek population has done to their cause the mob has shown itself odious and the government weak the incompetence of the greek administration and the horrors inflicted by the soldiers has put them in a terrible situation the consuls guaranteed the absolute safety of the muslims but sixty of them were massacred in a single night it wasn t only irregulars comitacis who massacred pillaged and burned the soldiers of the army the chief of police and the high civil officials took an active part in the events at serres out of houses were burned almost shops were consumed by flames and destructive bombs the jewish population lost all and without even anything to wear is in despair everyone wants to emigrate page as a result of these assaults massacres and forced deportations from the independent countries of southeastern europe the ottoman empire received literally thousands of jewish refugees who joined the muslims who survived the persecution flooding into the empire shlomo rozanes korot hayehudim beturkiyah

your armenian grandparents admitted their unspeakable crimes then in article apr leland stanford edu arto leland stanford edu artavazd khachikian writes this machine of idiotism continues to swing mr argic mutlu co is still functioning i was surprised to find it out when i finally looked at this newsgroup and this is just the beginning fascist x soviet armenian government will not get away with the genocide of million turks and kurds and azeri people your criminal grandparents committed unheard of crimes resorted to all conceivable methods of despotism organized massacres poured petrol over babies and burned them raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound hand and foot took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated personal property and real estate and today they put azeris in the most unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history your fascist grandparents admitted their unspeakable crimes then why deny them now now the genocide of the truth by the criminal nazi armenians not a chance source men are like that by leonard ramsden hartill the bobbs merrill company indianapolis pages memoirs of an armenian officer who participated in the genocide of million muslim people foreword for example we were camped one night in a half ruined tartar mosque the most habitable building of a destroyed village near the border of persia and russian armenia during the course of evening i asked ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and the cause of its destruction in his matter of fact way he replied yes i assisted in its sack and destruction and witnessed the slaying of those whose bones you saw to day scattered among its ruins p first and second paragraphs we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination our troops surrounded village after village little resistance was offered our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets completed the work some of the tartars escaped of course they found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into turkey the rest were killed and so it is that the whole length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the north were dotted with mute mournful ruins of tartar villages they are quiet now those villages except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead p second paragraph the tartars were for the most part poor some of them lived in villages and cultivated small farms many of them continued in the way of life of their nomadic forefathers they drove their flocks and herds from valley to valley from plain to mountain and from mountain to plain following the pasturage as it changed with the seasons they ranged from the salt desert shores of the caspian sea far into the mighty caucasus mountains even the village tartars are a primitive people only semicivilized i can see now that we armenians frankly despised the tartars and while holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country regarded and treated them as inferiors the fact that the russians looked down upon all armenians in much the same way as armenians regarded tartars far from proving a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors intensified an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility p second paragraph our men armed themselves gathered together and advanced on the tartar section of the village there were no lights in the houses and the doors were barred for the tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great fear our men hammered on the doors but got no response whereupon they smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last tartar was slain throughout the hideous night i cowered at home in terror unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and the loud shouts of our men by morning the work was finished p second paragraph as things were the members of the dashnack party were without administrative experience consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself incompetent to rule by legitimate means the members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and outside the law when they became a legally instituted recognized governing body with the destiny of armenia in their hands they proved incompetent to do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their fight against the russian and turkish governments in their outlaw days the outstanding feature of their rule now that they were in power was as in the old days trial and execution without hearing a man evoking the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him the method of execution was for a government mauserist to walk up behind the condemned man in his home or on the street place a pistol to the back of his head and blow out his brains this simple way of getting rid of those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became a common way of paying debts p first paragraph a soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the tartar i saw the point of the weapon emerge through his back another soldier seized a rock and pounded the tartar s head with it the armenian who had bayoneted him sprang to his feet wrested the weapon from the tartar s body and raising it to his lips licked it clean of blood exclaiming in russian slodkey slodkey sweet p second paragraph one evening i passed through what had been a tartar village among the ruins a fire was burning i went to the fire and saw seated about it a group of soldiers among them were two tartar girls mere children the girls were crouched on the ground crying softly with suppressed sobs lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and other furnishings of tartar peasant homes there were also bodies of the dead p first paragraph i was soon asleep in the night i was awakened by the persistent crying of a child i arose and went to investigate a full moon enabled me to make my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy that had been enacted guided by the child s crying i entered the yard of a house which i judged from its appearance must have been the home of a turkish family there in a corner of the yard i found a women dead her throat had been cut lying on her breast was a small child a girl about a year old p slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow the cart jolting and the loads swaying boys ran along the line of oxen encouraging them with shrill tartar cries and belaboring the beasts with sticks in the carts the women veiled as is the tartar way held children in their arms wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they sought protection from the wind and cold a few old men plodded along on foot across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown the leading oxteam reached this barrier and halted the gunmen and other ruffians concealed among the rocks opened fire women and children leaped and scrambled from the carts screamed ran and sought vainly for safety this massacre was not complete the armenian soldiers in the near by barracks hearing the firing and the turmoil hurried to the scene that same day the abandoned tartar quarter of alexandropol was looted and completely destroyed p great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding places on the retreat of the turks followed our army as it advanced they entered into the city with the army and immediately began plundering the stores that had been left by the turks p terrible vengeance was taken upon tartars kurds and turks their villages were destroyed and they themselves were slain or driven out of the country p the fanatical dashnacks hated the turks above all others and then in order of diminishing intensity tartars kurds and russians p first and second paragraphs russian troops did terrible things in the turkish villages we armenians did not spare the tartars if persisted in the slaughtering of prisoners the looting and the rape and massacre of the helpless become commonplace actions expected and accepted as a matter of course i have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground in numbers like the fallen leaves in a forest they had been as helpless and as defenseless as sheep they had not died as soldiers die in the heat of battle fired with ardor and courage with weapons in their hands and exchanging blow for blow they had died as the helpless must with their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself p first paragraph in this movement we took with us three thousand turkish soldiers who had been captured by the russians and left on our hands when the russians abandoned the struggle during our retreat to karaklis two thousand of these poor devils were cruelly put to death i was sickened by the brutality displayed but could not make any effective protest some mercifully were shot many of them were burned to death the method employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut and then after crowding the hut with turks set fire to the straw p first paragraph the tartar section of the town no longer existed except as a pile of ruins it had been destroyed and its inhabitants slaughtered the same fate befell the tartar section of khankandi p second paragraph many of our men had served in the russian army and were trained soldiers we armenians were rich and possessed arms tartars had never received military training they were poor and possessed few arms beyond knives shortly after the killing of the tartars in our village the revolution in russia was suppressed p third paragraph within a few years following the beginning of the movement an invisible government of armenians by armenians had been established in turkish armenia in armed opposition to the turkish government this secret government had its own courts and laws and an army of assassins called mauserists professional killers to enforce its decrees p first paragraph the dashnacks were in continual open rebellion against the turkish government p third paragraph the dashnacks engineered a general revolt of armenians in turkish armenia under the mistaken belief that european nations would intervene and secure independence for turkish armenia p second paragraph the dashnacks were fanatics p third paragraph the dashnacks took advantage of this situation and extended their revolutionary activities into the russian province they instituted a campaign of terrorism and employed threats and force in securing contributions to the party funds from rich armenians a wealthy man would be assessed a stipulated sum refusal to pay brought upon him a sentence of death every member of the party was pledged to carry out orders without question if a man were to be assassinated lots might be drawn to select an executioner or the job might be assigned to one of the mauserists of the party p first paragraph in moments of victory against turks and kurds or tartars they armenians have been remorseless in seeking vengeance p third paragraph the city was a scene of confusion and terror during the early days of the war when the russian troops invaded turkey large numbers of the turkish population abandoned their homes and fled before the russian advance p second paragraph i made a cannon a huge gun to lift which required four men i made balls for it with my cannon the armenians could knock down any of the tartar houses and so they were able to drive the tartars out p first paragraph the tartar villages were in ruins p third paragraph the dead tartar lay with his head in a pool of mud and blood his beard still setaceous and now crimsoned serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination ohanus appressian in soviet armenia today there no longer exists a single turkish soul sahak

else feels about it but for me it s torture we don t have a place to call our own i had a two bedroom apartment in sumgait my children went to school and we lived well in friendship it s painful that in our times in in the soviet period people can break into our apartment and try to kill me and my children in whom i ve put all my efforts and my whole youth everything was going well for us my older daughter was studying at the institute the middle one was preparing to enter medical school and was interning as an orderly and my youngest had been sick for a long time but had returned to health i have been though a lot in my life it s been seven years since i lost my husband i raised my children by myself lots of women have similar fates but there s nothing to be done about it but i can t control myself when i remember what happened in sumgait on february and it was just a horror it s indescribable on february our relative ira came to visit us she s better friends with my oldest daughter and so right away she asked where s vika i say vika s off in pirkuli on a trip for three days she s supposed to come back tomorrow my middle daughter gaya had baked a cake and we sat there talking and laughing drinking tea then gaya and diana went to walk ira home they left and a few minutes went by suddenly i hear noise i raced out to the balcony our balcony is right across from the bus station we live at the corner of mir and druzhba streets i look and see that there are hoards of people near the bus station and they re all shouting something what they re shouting i can t understand our neighbor is standing on his balcony too i ask nufar what s happened he says i don t know i can t figure it out either i got scared the kids had gone outside and i wanted to run after them but then there was a knock at the door i open the door and it s the kids mamma says gayane you ll never believe what s going on out there it s awful ira says aunt zina they re shouting karabagh karabagh karabagh is ours we didn t know what was going on they re threatening to drive out the armenians and slaughter them i called my brother and his wife answered the phone i said aunt tamara don t worry ira is staying here with us and we ll see her home later i couldn t shut my eyes all night long even until morning i was worried about vika my god what was going on what had happened gayane that day on the th we stood on the balcony and observed what was happening although mamma wouldn t allow us to watch all of it there weren t yards between our building and the bus station we could see and hear everything perfectly they were stopping buses dragging people out leading all the passengers out looking for armenians if they found an armenian on the bus then it started i don t know what to call it zinaida it s called slaughter gayane the mob would descend on people and beat them i don t know if they were killing them or not but when they left them they lay still not moving as though nothing was left of them one person was lying there and they started dragging him the police were standing right there to the side not doing anything they didn t take any steps to calm that mob it was awful to stand there and watch it all from the balcony and you couldn t go anywhere somehow you wanted to be able to see everything so as to tell of it later we wanted to leave sumgait that day what kept us was the idea that we live in the soviet union and that something would be done about it where in the world was our government zinaida we couldn t leave town of course because our older daughter wasn t home and at the same time i was terrified for gaya and diana on sunday morning when i went to see ira home our neighbor said zin you know they went into valodya s house and smashed everything he had they murdered his father and two sons valodya is our neighbor he s an armenian he lives on the first floor i think my god what is happening and in broad daylight i saw ira home and when on the way back i came across a mob shouting slay the armenians karabagh is ours this was at o clock in the afternoon on the way i stopped into a bread store and the saleswoman says they beat our store manager they thought he was an armenian and they beat him but he was an azerbaijani and i asked did they kill him she says no he s in serious condition i left there and started to walk home on that same street but the mob started moving in my direction i turned off the street and went down the little way that goes toward the sputnik store there i met another crowd but these weren t bandits these were our people from sumgait i was so frightened that i walked without knowing where was going i couldn t feel my legs or the ground under my feet i was walking and there was a boy standing before my eyes this was on the th around evening time he ran under our balcony and the mob surged toward him shouting he s an armenian get him he wore a black coat they grabbed him that boy near the bus stop i saw it they grabbed him by the legs and struck his head on the asphalt i made it home but i just couldn t calm down my oldest daughter was in my thoughts i was thinking my daughter s coming home now they ll stop her bus and she ll be gone there s no police no protection nothing it s like they had all died there s no one nothing no authorities whatsoever i can t even find the words for it i look and see an ikarus arriving before going to the bus station they stop near our place across from the kosmos movie theater so this ikarus stops there and the gang is yelling the azerbaijanis are running toward it yelling armenians out and i see them take the armenians and beat them killing them i can t watch it any more it was a nightmare i just couldn t watch it but gaya was standing there watching it and i scolded her she says mamma i have to see it i have to know what s happening i have to see it with my own eyes so i can tell our people of it later so our children will know gayane we saw a great deal on the th they caught no less than people before my eyes i can t say for sure if they killed them or not zinaida there were too many people there the mob was too big you couldn t make anything out but i saw that boy in the black coat with my own eyes he was or years old gayane i think he was older probably about a tall fellow a big guy in a coat he was walking quickly but when they shouted that he was an armenian he tore off running and the mob went after him they caught him right under our balcony i don t know i don t think there could have been much left of him after that you can imagine what happens when a crowd attacks one person it was a mob big angry and featureless you know there was a similarity in the way they were dressed mostly they were wearing long black coats you couldn t even tell them apart they were all wearing black and they all looked alike zinaida when they picked up that boy and struck him against the asphalt and he cried mamma i ran into the room i couldn t watch any longer an awful lot was going on right then in various places it wasn t only that boy several people were being beaten up you couldn t see all of it at once but when that boy cried mamma i immediately started watching only him gayane on that first day it went on from about six in the morning until twelve at night at midnight they dispersed and the police took their place they were scattered about in all districts but how can you explain the fact that by morning when it had already started getting light around seven o clock our police were gone the police disappeared and yielded their positions to the bandits in the morning they started gathering at our inter section again at the bus station and at the entrance to downtown from morning on all the roads and mass transit stops were covered and by nine o clock you couldn t even see the ground there were thousands of people in the crowd again they began stopping vehicles and checking for armenians zinaida they had signals i realized that when i noticed that they made a cross with their arms they crossed their arms over their heads the cross evidently meant that the vehicle had armenians in it they let the azerbaijani cars through and they stopped the armenian ones and started their pogrom gayane they stopped a white zhiguli and asked the driver what his nationality was he got out and said they were from baku but what is your nationality he says armenian they immediately start shouting ermeni ermeni and he says what s going on i m coming from baku i don t live in sumgait doesn t matter who cares if you re from baku or sumgait anyway the crowd pounced on him and started beating him and they dragged a woman his wife probably out of the car at this point the police came and took the two and led them away then the mob started smashing the car and then burned it the flames blazed it was a horrible fire then everyone ran away they thought the car was going to explode about minutes later another car comes along a green moskvich they ran up shouting ermeni ermeni but this time they didn t pull the people out of the car they didn t beat them maybe they burned them along with the car because no one emerged from the flames the neighbor boy vakhit was standing on the balcony too acquaintances of his walked by below and he asked them and they said yes they burned them along with the car about two hours later a whole wedding procession came by and there was a doll on the first car we thought they were armenians but the cars started to honk loudly they were azerbaijanis and they were immediately allowed through zinaida the driver waved his hand as if to say get out of the way the whole crowd parted and the procession passed through freely gayane by the way at the marriage hall which is right in the courtyard of our building there was a wedding that day the azerbaijanis were cele brating and dancing on the streets there was grief and death people were being killed and people were celebrating the whole time zinaida before the apartment itself was attacked i asked gaya to call and find out when the tourist bus was supposed to arrive she went to her girlfriend s in the building she lives in the first entryway on the third floor gaya came back and said mamma the bus is supposed to come around eight after eight you can imagine what i was feeling how hard it was vika knew nothing about what was happening and was coming to meet her death then i heard shouting i raced to the window and see that the belongings of our neighbors from the second entryway are being thrown outdoors they were thrashing about with the pillows and the feathers were lying like snow i started to cry i am walking around the room crying wailing vika s not here what will come of her gaya of course was consoling me mamma nothing will happen to her don t worry calm down she s in good company they ll look out for her diana i saw the green car burn the car was burning when we went out onto the balcony gaya pushed me away telling me to get off the balcony i left then they came up to the balcony and asked if there were any armenians here zinaida you re right i forgot about that that was on the th diana there s a small grassy area in front of our balcony there are trees planted there the mob asked if there were any armenians in the building all the neighbors said no there are no armenians here there weren t a lot of armenians in our building but there weren t just a few armenian families either gayane they fell upon the apartments on the th there were terribly many of them our courtyard is huge and it was completely filled with them zinaida katusev had made an appearance on television earlier he said that two people azerbaijanis had been killed in karabagh and when he said that you know how bees sound have you heard how they buzz it was like the buzzing of millions of bees and with this buzzing they flew into our courtyard howling and shouting i don t know how to describe it by this point we were afraid to watch from the balcony but when i looked out of the bedroom window the znaniye bookstore is down there and armenians live on the second and fourth floors i saw their things being thrown out the windows i realized that they would be upon us any minute i shouted to gayane gaya hide the gold that s honestly what i told my child i grabbed diana i didn t know what to do vika still wasn t home and it was already getting dark i was afraid to look at the time because i was already horrified as it was gayane just in case we changed the television channel from the moscow station to the azerbaijani one zinaida and turned it up loud gayane we never listened to azerbaijani music it just didn t do much for us in all those years we almost never listened to it but sometimes we would watch some entertainment show or film on azerbaijani television and that was it and here we had it turned up full blast so they would think we were azerbaijanis zinaida well you can imagine they re slaughtering armenians robbing them and we re listening to this concert music from baku our azerbaijani neighbors suggested we do it they knocked on the door and told gaya to turn on azerbaijani music but we already had it on anyway turn on the lights they told us so they will think you re not armenians they re saying the armenians are afraid to turn on their lights they re hiding gayane apparently there was some kind of arrangement because we noticed that the lights were off only in armenian apartments that is the azerbaijanis were warned and every last one of them had their lights on when we turned the lights off two of our neighbors came immediately and later another one turn on the lights they told us please nothing will happen be calm nothing will happen zinaida we won t allow them to come into your apartment gayane we believed those people we had never done anything bad to them zinaida after the whole nightmare about march before we left for armenia when i was coming into the building they were all crying the azerbaijanis were crying saying can it be there is no god how could they raise their hands against your family you never did anyone any harm you never refused anyone anything not in hard times or in time of fortune or in time of mourning how could they give you away how could they sell you down the river they really had given us away some of them protected us but others gave us away they sold us down the river gayane i was wearing slacks that day and when it all began i became cautious for some reason and i changed my clothes azerbaijani women don t wear pants young armenian and russian girls in sumgait wore pants but the azerbaijanis found that very strange and i thought i better put on a skirt otherwise they won t believe me if i told them we were azerbaijanis there was nothing else we could do no other way out i was forced to turn myself into god knows who i let my hair down tousled it and threw a scarf over my head zinaida and she told me mamma you hide take diana and go into the other room you two look more like armenians they ll figure out that we re armenians right away but how could i go away and leave her there gayane i went out onto the balcony it worked out better that way we were the only armenian family in the fourth entryway this gave us hope we were the only ones the neighbors wouldn t let them in they the azerbaijanis would fear for themselves and for their children i looked and saw someone crawling up on the balcony from below it was easy to get up onto our balcony when we would lose the keys the neighbors would let up into their places and we would crawl across onto our balcony and get in that way so i turned around and saw a guy with a knife on our balcony he looks at me and shouts what nationality are you here zinaida at the same time they were knocking on the door gayane what nationality are you he s shouting well at first i was frightened but then i got control of myself and answered in perfect azerbaijani you should be ashamed of yourself asking a question like that can t you see i m an azerbaijani if i were an armenian would i come out to meet you face to face and look you in the eyes he looks at me and tells the people with him yes azerbaijanis live here from below they tell him check it out it can t be they have to be armenians and he asks me again what nationality are you i say can t you see i started fuming i could not say anything else you re blind that s for sure you can yell all you want but that won t make us armenians i hear them breaking down our door and mamma went toward the door i say i don t have time to deal with you they re breaking down our door go to the door and ask who is it they answer open up i say wait why are you breaking the door what s going on i m opening up we never locked the lower lock it was broken but now they had locked it out of fear and i couldn t get it open i say wait i m looking for the key i opened the door it was almost broken down already i opened the door and they burst in i say what s going on why are you breaking down our door zinaida then they started climbing in from the balcony they re shouting why don t you open the door and i say well you ve already come in the balcony then diana sees their knives runs into the bathroom and closes the door gaya cries out mamma diana ran into the bathroom i ran to the door and forgot that we were pretending to be azerbaijanis and said in armenian diana open the door gaya tried to calm them down and i m shouting with tears in my eyes for diana to open the door diana i was sitting on the couch with my doll little red riding hood that guy climbed in from the balcony with a big knife with a yellow handle they put it up to mamma s stomach i ran to the bathroom opened the door and slammed it behind me i was frightened and started to cry i shouted mamma they want to kill you and then then they started shouting give us your passports and gaya says what do you need passports for we re azerbaijanis gayane i tried to convince them that we were azerbaijanis i was trying everything i could i could get on my knees and plead i could humble myself because at that moment i was worried about other lives than just my own to be honest i didn t care about anything else as long as my little sister would survive her life and health had cost us so dearly i tell them what don t you understand anything they started shouting they were tremendously excited shouting with terribly loud voices saying that in stepanakert their girls were being killed raped and tossed around with pitchforks why shouldn t they do the same to us i said who s doing all that who is doing it some armenians what does that have to do with us give me the knife i ll cut my own face now you calm down they tell me zinaida i told them why didn t you deal with them there there in karabakh nothing has happened here no one has been fighting here not we with the armenians nor they with us why didn t you give it right back to them there what ve we got to do with this i got confused i had been saying that we were azerbaijanis but suddenly i started speaking as though i were an armenian but they didn t notice one of them was next to me with a knife at my breast and he says to the others what pretty girls he meant gaya and my year old diana i was terrified gaya started assuring them that we were azerbaijanis one guy stood in the doorway and gave us bad looks gayane he demanded the passports i said young man i don t have my passport here he says let s have the passport we won t believe you without your passport and one of them started hurriedly searching for documents they turned the wardrobe in the other room upside down took the picture off the wall and started pulling the clothes off their hooks yelling and shouting passport passport they all started yelling there was so much noise in the apartment they were all shouting my hair stood on end suddenly i said listen my papa died days haven t passed yet we have a muslim household we re in mourning you should be ashamed of yourselves you ve disgraced your honor and then mamma started to cry zinaida i started crying my husband died days haven t yet passed aren t you ashamed of yourselves in fact my husband had died seven years earlier in we re in mourning and you burst in here demanding docu ments the documents are at the housing office i m filing for my pension well it seemed like they believed us then one guy said they re lezgins can t you see there are no men here only women leave another fellow in the group agreed with him he also said that we were lezgins but a third said no they re armenians well the other two convinced him i don t know how and all the rest of them listened to them too there were about of them if not more all in our three room apartment even the entryway was filled they started leaving yes we re lezgins we re lezgins they started leaving and one of them took our tape recorder with him and the one who had first called us lezgins says leave that what are you doing they seemed to obey that guy gayane he was tall wearing baggy jeans and a coat zinaida with a little moustache i think gayane no he didn t have a moustache he was tall with brown hair he wasn t a bad looking sort he didn t have anything in his hands zinaida he stood at the threshold gayane yes he didn t look like a bad guy and you know his face seemed familiar to me i had seen him somewhere and more than once but i can t remember where when he came in i was stupefied i had a premonition that he wouldn t be able to remain indifferent when he said that we were lezgins and that they should leave such gladness started to glow inside of me hope they continued to argue on their way out some said they re armenians all the same and that fellow answered even if they are armenians it s shameful the father died they re mourning there s nothing but women in the house there s no men we should stay out of the apartment what do you mean stay out we can go in there and he said no we should stay out they re lezgins we re leaving here the three of them protected us zinaida no the two of them the one in the short coat and the one in the grey suit who stood at the threshold about or years old well they were all young really the two of them defended us diana three three zinaida do you remember the third one diana diana yes he was wearing dark clothes gayane the third one was the one who came back he wore a long brown coat diana he wore a long darkish brown coat and his hair was dark too when they left they told him downstairs that those women were armenians and ran back and said that they were going to kill us zinaida they had all left and we had started to calm down a little and i closed the door and then there is a knock i told gaya take diana and go into the other room my daughters went into the dining room and i opened the door there was a guy there who said run hide they re coming to kill you now we ran up to the third floor we had some good neighbors up there azerbaijanis i sent the kids and stood there alone not knowing what to do i was so far gone out of a whole room i couldn t even think of anything to take i even forgot to take my work documents at the time i had been preparing a report to send to baku and the documents were at home i couldn t see anything i could only see vika my older daughter i sent gaya and diana upstairs and stood there asking that fellow should i close the door and leave everything like this he says what do you mean door get out of here they re coming to kill you what are you standing there for and i ran after the children gayane we barely had time to get up to the third floor when they burst into our apartment and started shouting where are the armenians we were already at the neighbors they had an infant at the time and the neighbor said don t you worry i m not letting anyone in this apartment no matter what zinaida on the third floor there i started asking the folks our neighbors to go meet vika the bus was due to arrive at eight o clock i dissolved in tears gaya was soothing me diana was next to us she was crying too and i m already thinking that i ve lost my older daughter but deep in my heart i still believe she s alive and my tears choked me i was going out of my mind but no one could leave the building the courtyard was packed with people swarming with them from the balcony the neighbor in whose apartment we were hiding asked the bandits where are those armenians the ones who were at home where did they make off to they told him they didn t know they asked him where he lived he answered can t you see on the third floor he asked them specially to divert attention from his own apartment we heard them taking free reign of our apartment and they threw our color television off the balcony and it exploded gayane mamma was crying the whole time she fell into a faint and we brought her around and held her back because the whole time she kept making for the door to go outside alternately raving and sobbing shouting and calling vika she didn t notice us probably because we were next to her her thoughts were only on vika the neighbors who were hiding us were calming her too offering tea zinaida we are very grateful to them thanks to them my children and i are alive well and unharmed when they were throwing our belongings out and burning them the beds the pillows and the chairs our neighbor came to us and said how lucky you are that it s not you standing there naked but some other woman instead you re from our part of the building you lost your husband you have children thank god you re not in her position we wouldn t have been able to take it i don t know what i would do he of course wouldn t have done anything he was just trying to calm us down in the yard they were torturing our neighbors fellow armenians they lived on the fifth floor in the third entryway a married couple vanya and nina and their three children their last name is v they hid their two daughters and stayed with their son to defend themselves they even got boiling water ready and an axe and held them off for a long time but the they beat up the husband dragged the wife outside and stood her naked next to our burning things her husband was lying at her feet on the ground the crowd shouted look at the naked armenian they were going to throw the poor woman into the fire the neighbors came out an azerbaijani woman threw her a scarf and she covered herself with it and the neighbors led her off to their apartment all the neighbors saw and heard it gayane mamma wouldn t allow it but i went to the window and saw her standing there and they took skewers that had been heated in the fire and stuck them into her body our neighbor who lived in the same entryway as nina she lives with us in the same boarding house now saw what they had done nina showed her from her knees up almost up to her neck her whole body was covered riddled with wounds zinaida in the morning during the night of the th rather after one o clock two buses approached the station i wanted to run out by then i didn t care any more if i lived or died but gayane wouldn t let me go and the neighbors said that i would bring disaster to them and they would be slain along with their children gaya was crying and said that i forgot about them my other children but i could only think of vika i imagined her torn to pieces i m a mother and they re just children they don t understand i would have jumped off the balcony and run to the soldiers for help i was going to do it but gayane wouldn t let me mamma please mamma i beg of you the neighbors were sleeping and gayane woke them with her cries so we held on that way till morning on the morning of the th i told our neighbor i was going to go downstairs to our apartment maybe vika was lying there murdered he told me he would go himself he was gone for about five minutes but it seemed like an eternity to me he returned and said there was no one there nothing i went down too stole down like a mouse and slipped in everything was thrown all about i didn t go to the soldiers because the armored personnel carriers were far away farther than the bus station i began looking for the briefcase with my work in it i was miserable because of my daughter and at the same time because of my work my documents were there my travel papers i worked in the transport division and my trip sheets gayane mamma is a very responsible person she was always ready to work around the clock to do her job zinaida i look around and i can t find the briefcase i didn t care about the fact that everything had been stolen out of all three of my rooms that everything was smashed and the furniture was broken i worried about that later but at first i was concerned about the lost documents i went into the kitchen my daughter had hidden some valuables in the gas stove my ring and my earrings it was all there five minutes passed and gayane ran in and said mamma hurry and diana came downstairs too gayane found her coat among the debris and diana found her track shoes her coat and some of her dresses diana immediately after we got back up to the neighbors they started throwing things around in the apartment under us they threw a television onto the asphalt it exploded so violently it sounded like a thunderclap then when vika wasn t there i wouldn t eat and they forced me but i couldn t eat because i loved vika terribly and she and i had always gone to the movies and gone for walks in the park when we went into our apartment the next day and everything was broken right away i started looking for my dolls and my books but i didn t see anything when we went back upstairs i managed to take two cups from my tea service and gaya took vika s suit and one of her own dresses my italian boots were gone my brown coat it was beautiful there wasn t a one of my beautiful dolls and my giant lion was gone too the one that had been on top of the television he was very large and very handsome i had two satchels one for first grade and the other for second grade one was yellow green with a boy and a girl on it they re playing a drum and a violin and there is a dog sitting there closing its ears and on the other one were the letters a b c d e and the numbers two girls and a boy with their mouths open like they are singing they were beautiful satchels they were gone too i had many books i collected them they were in the bedside tables and a boy had given me a little apron and a headband for my birthday they weren t around either and i had some big books fat ones and they disappeared only one was left the malachite box the adventures of karlson pippi longstockings and fairy tales of the world were left all the other books were gone zinaida i continued searching for my briefcase and then my supervisor arrived he had waited for me until nine o clock but i didn t appear and he thought something must have happened so he came he s a russian aleksei semyonovich lomakin alik aliyev the mechanic came with him when they saw my wrecked apartment they were just petrified they could not say a thing when i saw them i started crying my azerbaijani neighbors came in some of them were crying others were helping me pick up i go on looking for my documents and at the same time put things into the wardrobe now that i remember it it s both funny and painful how could i have thought that i had returned to my apartment and that everything had gone back to normal incidentally later when i went back to the apartment again those things were gone too and the door was gone after my supervisor left in the afternoon the neighbor said that we should leave find another refuge i m afraid he said that someone saw you come to my apartment and that they could kill you and us too my god where could i go it was daytime and those i don t even know what to call them the bandits those marauders those jackals i don t know what to call them i can t find the words they were everywhere where should i go with two girls when i opened the door i had tears in my eyes and i was terrified and he said go to alik s he s an azerbaijani too and i say you should have said that earlier when my supervisor was here with the car he could have taken us with him everyone feared for their own lives what could i do i went out into the entryway and stood and he says any other time i would keep you here a year or two but right now i m sorry then another door opened also on the third floor i ask the neighbor tayara can we hide at your place she s an azerbaijani too she says what kind of question is that come in she hid us there were many people in the courtyard and gaya and i hid in the wardrobe and they put diana under a mattress leaving a small opening so the child could breathe tayara said that when the bandits left she would let us out and when they came back she would hide us again we sat in the wardrobe for about a half hour gaya became ill and i allowed her to get out my legs fell asleep and felt like cannons we hadn t eaten or drunk anything for so long since the th when we saw that horror and all of it just snapped in me tayara s husband went outside even though i begged him to stay saying there should be a man in the house he said that he d be in the courtyard and if anything happened his wife would signal him she put her passport and all of their documents on the table so if they suddenly came in she could show them that they were an azerbaijani family my girls went to the window and what was going on out there i feared for my children that someone would recognize them from the street gaya let her hair down and put on a scarf so she would resemble an azerbaijani but directly across there was a story building their windows were right across from us and i shouted that someone would see her and give us away on the spot but she kept on looking diana i watched too zinaida downstairs the bandits were fighting with the soldiers the soldiers didn t shoot they didn t have orders to i saw them throwing rocks at the soldiers they were young boys and year olds and they defended themselves i m a mother after all and they were no different from my children when one of the soldiers fell and his head started bleeding i had to stop looking l couldn t watch anymore i imagined my children in their shoes gayane the troops had assumed their defense that morning and had cordoned off the buildings and some of the soldiers surrounded the bus station block and our microdistrict but they only cordoned them off from the outside the mob fell upon the soldiers who started to protect themselves and the mob surged into the courtyard with the soldiers after it they caught several azerbaijanis and started beating them with their clubs one fell down and they cracked open another s head zinaida they show lebanon on television and the war in afghanistan that s just what it was like like in america how they attack demonstrations with shields and clubs that s just how it was in our courtyard gayane don t compare it with america those were peaceful demonstrations but these zinaida but how could it happen here and not off somewhere in america they attacked the soldiers hurled stones at them then i thought where s the tear gas that the americans use to disperse demonstrators if they had used gas on those jackals they all would have scattered gayane they would not have scattered the soldiers had been there since morning they didn t bring in fresh troops they hadn t eaten they were fine standing there for about three hours but then they got tired they weren t even allowed to sit down at noon they the soldiers attacked them and then the tables were turned the mob went after the soldiers the guys were bunched into a group in the center street and covered themselves with their shields and the azerbaijanis surrounded them and threw paving stones at them and those guys sat there covering themselves with their shields and meanwhile tanks with machine guns were cruising the streets they always say our children have never seen war i never even dreamed about it there was no need to but then i thought about those people who had lived through a war it was truly horrible the guys were tired exhausted some had had their clubs taken away others their shields they had been beaten they were covered in blood so many died they beat the soldiers with their own clubs and shields and those guys stood there and couldn t defend themselves they couldn t open fire they couldn t even defend themselves let alone us it s comical zinaida what are you saying how can it be funny gayane no i didn t mean that how could something like that happen during our soviet period it s painfully embarrassing and they burned the armored personnel carriers too someone shouted get away it s going to blow everyone scattered away and the armored personnel carrier exploded the soldiers lost their senses and when they drove the personnel carrier and the bus at the mob out of rage and fury they drove right up on the sidewalk zinaida the bus that had brought the troops only the driver was in it the bus ran over three people straight off i saw it and two armored personnel carriers ran over four more all in one or two minutes the bus ran over three one of the carriers ran over two and the second two more right on our street there s a dry cleaners and appliance and watch repair places one of the armored personnel carriers went that way and they say it ran over several over there too but they ran over seven before our eyes then the bus ploughed into a book kiosk gayane no that was a flower place it was a new booth he drove straight into it zinaida the driver jumped out and they dragged the vehicle out to the middle of the road and set it on fire gayane and i also saw the troops put a bunch of azerbaijanis in a bus and take them in a convoy to baku there were many arrests zinaida our neighbor the one who hid us couldn t take it and he told his wife that we should leave they were running around in the courtyard looking for the armenians they knew that they were hiding with azerbaijanis and they were saying that they were going to check the azerbaijani families poor tayara got scared too and started to cry i pleaded with her i said that i would remember forever how she saved my children and me but where could we go gayane she didn t make us leave she said that she would do anything but she was afraid zinaida i told tayara that we would just stay a little longer and that at night we would return to our apartment then her husband came back and said that a curfew had been imposed he says zina you owe us a drink gorbachev announced a curfew and bagirov first secretary of the communist party of azerbaijan ssr was on television he said that two people had been killed in karabagh but nothing was wrong automobile windows had been broken but there hadn t been any killings he kept making statements and there were azerbaijani songs and dances tayara turned the tv all the way up when we learned of the curfew we calmed down but then a crowd ran into the courtyard again a large one our neighbor told them that there had been only one armenian family here but they had already killed them all there was no one left we hid in the wardrobe again and they stuck diana back under the bed gayane tayara went down to our apartment to see what was happened there and found two bandits they asked her what are you doing here tayara answered i came to take something for myself take all you want they re gone now zinaida yes she had wanted to get something for us at least some bedding she said what are you going to do empty handed naked with three children nothing remains of your entire apartment in short we calmed down and the crowd raced off to the other building the one across from us i don t know what went on there gayane the curfew had its effect on the gangs many started to disperse they were warned that they would open fire on them the soldiers didn t know the city they couldn t get oriented they drove up and down the main streets but didn t go into the courtyards when we were at the city party committee they asked people from sumgait to go with them and show them the way zinaida the tanks entered the city on the night of the th gayane no mamma the tanks had been there earlier but were near the city party committee where the armenians were after midnight on march when i had finally gotten to sleep after two sleepless nights mamma said get your things together they have sent buses for us as it was we had been dressed the entire time mamma went to check it out and came back for us zinaida when i came back for the children tayara said that vika was alive and well some guys had come and told her that they had hidden her in a safe place i both believed it and didn t believe it we ran out to the tanks the gambarians were there roman and sasha their father shurik the clarinetist was killed and their mother was there sasha came over and asked about the girls i was surprised how did he know my girls he said that he knew me and the girls our neighbor himself went for gaya and diana and it seemed like he was taking forever so i went after him another neighbor came out anna vasilyevna a russian zinochka my dear goodbye and good luck she kissed diana they put us in the bus and the captain gave the order for us to be taken to the city party committee the bus wouldn t start so they put us on another one it was pouring rain diana when they imposed the curfew there were many soldiers on the streets and they all had clubs and shields and when the azerbaijanis attacked them many of the soldiers died they threw paving stones huge rocks at the soldiers i saw this myself the soldiers ran over those azerbaijanis with the tanks the soldiers saw that the azerbaijanis were doing violence to people and they ran over them out of rage we got scared and they hid me under a mattress and a blanket and gaya and mamma crawled into the wardrobe and they were fighting right down there on the street near the building they were blowing up buses and tanks and cars were burning and there were many dead in the courtyard they drove without looking to see if it was a sidewalk or a street they just drove and the ones who didn t manage to get out of the way were run over by the tanks and when we left it was evening it was already dark there were three buses and one of them had soldiers in it mamma ran up and said get your clothes on let s go gaya was wearing slippers and i had on my blue dress but it was an old one i was wearing my old jacket my old dress and slippers and nothing else gaya had on a skirt her angora sweater and slippers it was raining hard and there were puddles on the street they gave mamma an old coat because she was wearing a short sleeved dress she put it on and we ran out we got onto the bus and i was hungry one of the soldiers from yerevan gave me rations and carried me from one bus to the other in his arms i gave him the little glass that remained from vika s trousseau and he gave me his telephone number gayane in the bus there was a soldier with a shield sitting at every window we had to be ready for anything they took us to the city party committee let us out and then took us into the city party committee building under armed guard it was jammed with people and you couldn t breathe we asked are these all us armenians they answered yes we were surprised that there were so many armenians in sumgait all those years we lived there and didn t know there were so many armenians we were struck by that we had never noticed going downstairs the next day i ran into the secretary of the komsomol from vika s plant the khimprom he said that vika was alive and well when i told mamma she of course calmed down some more but you know after all that it was hard to believe anything our faith in everything was just gone she didn t believe it completely zinaida i didn t believe it because i had heard all kinds of things when we arrived at the city party committee we heard everything imaginable it was the fear of god i saw many of our acquaintances they were kissing each other and asking how their children and homes were many people already knew that there had been a pogrom of our apartment they had seen the broken windows i cried saying that i didn t know where vika was one woman said that they had taken two of her daughters and that she couldn t find one of them the other had been slashed all over a second said that her husband and her son had been murdered that was nelli aramian she lived in building in our microdistrict they killed her husband armo and her son artur i heard so many things like that that i was already starting to lose touch my patience had run dry waiting for my daughter later an azerbaijani fellow came to me and said aunt zina vika sent me she s alive and well and hidden in a safe place if you want i ll call her there and you can speak with her we went downstairs to the first floor and he called vika i spoke with her heard the voice of my child she had managed to survive in that hell then i started begging that azerbaijani to bring her to the city party committee he tried to talk me out of it i ll bring her wherever you go don t worry i ve looked after her better than a brother does a sister all the same i asked him to get her he brought her and i calmed down on the second day there was a meeting with demichev member of the politburo of the central committee of the communist party of the ussr and people started shouting one shouted give me my son back another yelled where is my daughter a third wanted her husband bagirov was there too and he stood there blinking not saying anything gayane when demichev asked where we wanted to go everyone shouted to russia to be honest we were all frightened of armenia there were such wild rumors it was as though we were in a terrible dream and no one wanted to go to armenia but he said that he couldn t evacuate people to russia and that he would meet with everyone individually the next day and speak with them and he also said that today he was going to go look at all of our apartments on march we went to the military barracks in the village of nasosny we were taken care of marvelously by the military they sent special flights of children right from there to minvody yerevan and moscow one woman left for moscow with a letter for gorbachev and gromyko zinaida the worst was truly behind us by then everything had passed but the pain will remain for our whole lives it cannot be forgotten under no circumstances should we our children or our grandchildren forget who will answer for those who died for our mothers sisters brother sons and daughters who will bear the responsibility who will wash away their blood someone should be made to answer and severely so it has an effect on the people that did with us as they pleased it isn t over yet now we live here in armenia protected but the issue isn t resolved we would like to stay in armenia in our homeland so that all the armenian people will be united then we will be invincible armenians won t be scattered throughout the soviet union about the world and if we re all together this won t happen again as a mother of three children as a woman as a sister i ask armenians to be united so that what happened in sumgait will never happen again our homeland the only request we have is that we be helped in obtaining an apartment and getting jobs so that our children can work for the good of armenia if we aren t able to then let our children do it and if it s possible we ll work for the good of armenia too this is the land of our forefathers our grandfathers and great grandfathers lived here too it was only later that people dispersed all over like a mother the land here bore and reared us it is our wife and will protect us too i want but one thing that our people never see the hardship that our children saw that your children here in

re benjamin franklin iii so mr salah is still claiming stalin was a jew this thread began on sca when he and another guy claimed both stalin and lenin were jews when i posted evidence from books and the britannica showing they were christians someone made the correct remark that lenin s maternal grandfather was a jew who converted to christianity to counter the fact that stalin was a christian who during his youth was trained to be a priest mr salah wrote yes it says he was trained to be a priest but not for what religion btw stalin developed strong antisemitic feelings later in his life mr salah seems intent on trying to spread hate against jews by posting antisemitic forgeries and trying to prove that certain notorious people were jews even if they were not danny keren

re israel an apartheid state in article igc apc org center for policy research cpr igc apc org writes by elias davidsson april revision oct note you are already posting facts some of which are outdated the biased presentation of facts as well as the conclusions that you reach leave me little hope of engaging in any fruitful exchange that might lead to a meeting of the minds it is to those who read with open mind that i address myself the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination adopted by the general assembly of the united nations in has now been ratified by most member states article of this convention defines the term racial discrimination as any distinction exclusion restriction or preference based on race colour descent or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition enjoyment or exercise on an equal footing of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political economic social cultural or any other field of public life while the ideals embodied in this text are worthy goals as the text currently stands i know of no country in which racial discrimination of some sort can not be found it makes no mention of the need for for a legislative violation the general assembly endorsed in a resolution defining zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination the important correct and legitimate resolution is incomplete since it does not include operative statements designed to end israeli racial discrimination meanwhile the united states on behalf of israel are exerting heavy pressure on member states of the united nations to repeal this resolution and give israeli racial practices zionism moral legitimacy if you are in principle advocating un intervention via operative statements in this case it must therefore hold that they can be applied to any other case where the council perceives some form of racial discrimination as previously exhibited scarey thought the very definition of israel as a state belonging to the jews of the world but not to its inhabitants alienates all native non jews born in that country actually i know quite a few native non jews born in israel that are not alienated by this law if you had said some you would probably be correct however your tendency to exagerate and slant facts becomes apparent this slant permeates the text practically all non jews who are living in or originate from areas under israeli control identify themselves as palestinians most of them are muslim many are christian a few jews including the author of these lines also identify themselves as palestinians the above statement is not true practically all discounting beduins circassians druze and some other fringe groups your own identification is a matter that has no bearing upon the issue you could equally identify yourself as a insert group zionism took off in europe at the end of last century it s aim was to create a jewish state in palestine in spite of the adamant opposition of palestinian arabs of the population if i recall correctly at the time zionism took off there was no adamant opposition in palestine i am open to any factual contradictory evidence but the zionists were more powerful militarily economically and technologically and succeeded in in conquering of the area of mandatory palestine after driving into exile most native arabs from the conquered areas approximately people and razing most of their villages to the ground the zionists could finally establish a predominantly jewish state only non jews remained on israeli territory do you therefore contend that the villages you mention further on most of their villages once the jewish state was established it began enacting laws to help the confiscation of land from native non jews their political repression and their destitution there is no doubt that laws passed provided a framework which was later used for these purposes however you seem to imply that this was the intention a priori which implies a policy and agenda my knowledge was that this was not the case you also neglect to mention the circumstances that surrounded this as you do again below in the state of israel invaded egypt and syria and occupied the rest of palestine the west bank and the gaza strip thus another million palestinians fell under its juridiction its occupation of palestinian and other arab territories is considered illegal by the international community as reflected in security council resolutions israel has rejected all u n resolutions and began without delay to entrench its occupation and rule over these territories with the aim of annexing them at the appropriate time not quite accurate israel has not rejected all the resolutions though it has conflicting understanding with regards to some of them israel never annexed the sinai west bank or gaza the other annexations were brought about partly due to the un resolutions part of these territores east jerusalem and the golan heights have already been forcefully annexed by israel in defiance of international law and un resolutions out of curiousity provided that the annexees are granted citizenship what int l law do you claim prohibits annexation of territories captured in war has this ever been applied to any other country previously other than iraq it must be emphasized that although these people live under different regimes they are united in their self perception as palestinians that is as people identifying with palestine a territorial entity not an ethnic or religious entity incorrect palestinians themselves claim to be discriminated against on an ethnic or racial basis therefore your above statement is incorrect i also note that given the previous definition of racial discrimination the only means that you could argue for that is nationalistically however no such nation has existed it definitely did not exist at the time of the creation of israel in which case you can not argue racial discrimination during that period furthermore palestinians generally consider the plo both as a symbol of national identity and as the unchallenged authority that represents them in world affairs once again some do some don t the non jewish population living in the palestinian and other arab territories occupied by israel in suffers not only blatant discrimination but is subject to brutal military occupation another generalization but then again you don t seem to care about anyone other than the palestinian people whose cause you espouse licence to start a business and to buy industrial equipment the right to educate children all of these basic rights are subject to arbitrary rulings by military authorities and cannot be challenged in court incorrect once again they have the ability to appeal furthermore although you may not agree with them not all of the military rulings are senseless or arbitrary some are but this is not due to the whims of the military as much as the sizeof the task organization only jewish inhabitants of the occupied territories are permitted to carry firearms incorrect once again i know two arab policemen who lived in daheisha and there were more of course with the outbreak of the intifada they were forced by the locals to resign bitterly jewish settlers have right to more water per person than non jews jewish residents of these territories number now about people it is israel governmentus policy to increase this number substantially in total defiance of international law un resolutions and the will of the population the state of israel systematically confiscates land from non jewish inhabitants of these territories for jewish settlement that is no longer true and i can t help but wonder what your purpose is was in posting this some people in israel proper are not jews most of them consider themselves palestinians with israeli citizenship for many years after the establishment of israel they were subjected to harsh military control much of their land was confiscated by the state and handed to jewish organisations for exclusive jewish settlement they have been subject to massacres destitution and humiliation while they enjoy with jewish israelis the right to vote they are discriminated against both through law and in practice once again to hell with the other minorities that don t fit in right their are many villages who did not suffer in the way you seem to indicate abu gosh comes to mind yes some did but as a result of what actions approximately of the surface of the state of israel within the rgreen lines is for all purposes closed to palestinians who are second class citizens in israel they may neither legally live on such land nor rent or cultivate it a direct effect of these policies is that native non jewish citizens of israel are denied residence and membership rights in most rural communities in israel including the collective settlements kibbutzim non jews are discriminated against in many other ways the government starves local authorities of palestinian villages and townships of funds jewish city councils force palestinians to live in ghettos jewish families receive higher child allocations than their non jewish neighbors palestinian schools suffer underfunding and understaffing as compared to jewish schools palestinian children are denied the right to learn their history and literature israelis who struggle for equal rights and for the end of racial discrimination suffer continuous harassment by the authorities there are some kibbutzim with arab non jewish members it is up to the members of the kibbutz there is no legislation against it nor against a purely non jewish collective funds are the result of political lobbying bearing in mind that non jews compose of the voting population it has never failed to amaze me that they fail to form one large bloc and increase their power the recent elections are a case in point please provide factual evidence supporting your allegation with regard to educational material you have obviously never seen the curriculum of a school in the west bank it is based upon jordan s school system with regard to your last statement it is simply another gross generalization the state of israel refuses to acknowledge itself as the state of all its inhabitants although the israeli cabinet has never openly endorsed the transfer idea the forced removal from the country of its native palestinian population that is its ultimate judaization israeli government policies towards non jews bear the mark of this final solution no attempt is made by the zionist authorities to integrate palestinian arabs into israeli public life thus although comprising approximately of the population of israeli citizens no palestinian citizen of israel has ever served as cabinet member as director of ministry or of a national institution as judge of the supreme court as ambassador of israel or in any leading position in israeli economic or financial life even the director of the ministry for arab affairs yes such a thing exists is a jew another generalization but lets not stop here the transfer idea was espoused by one party in the last gov t moledet it was intended to be a solution to the problem in the territories not the country itself with regard to other items i recall at least one arab ambassador and the rest was covered previously although sexual relations between and cohabitation of jews and non jews are legal they are considered by israeli zionist society somewhat a betrayal of the jewish and zionist ethics the israeli educational system nurtures this attitude in a systematic way when was the last time you were in israel that is simply not true nor has it been for quite some time the question of religious intervention is best answered by the proportional representation and the lack of any arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one zionism rejects the idea of a modern secular state based on equality of all citizens this is one main reason why israel has not produced any written constitution simply incorrect the answer is political once again your failure to understand the dynamics and movements inside israeli gov t relegates your contentions to the sidelines zionism predicates a state where jews have privileged rights thus according to israeli law a jew born in london who has never visited israel does not speak hebrew and professes atheism is granted automatic israeli citizenship while native palestinian inhabitants who happen to be christian or muslim are treated almost as aliens racial discrimination as defined in international law is thus not only reflected in israeli laws and policies but is grounded in the very nature of israel as a jewish state but the discrimination is not based upon race oops sorry nasty habit i have of countering malicious false truths any proposal for israeli arab and israeli palestinian peace that does not address the issue of racial discrimination by israel that is the zionist nature of the state of israel is thus doomed to fail real world intrusion any proposal that does is doomed to fail of course i wouldn t expect you to understand wrapped up as you are in your view of things let s not let anything penetrate shall we i may be a bit

re deir yassin hm cs brown edu writes in article apr virginia edu rj s virginia edu get thee to a nunnery writes this is such bullshit deir yassin was an unprovoked attack on the part of the jews and a massacre defines it best in my opinion the village of deir yassin had had a pact with the jews a peace pact but the irgun purposely broke this agreement in order to scare off the palestinians i might grant that this village housed armed arabs i doubt it but nothing in the archives and available literature indicates that this was a motivating force amongst the irgun the deir yassin massacre was part of an over all strategy to intimidate the palestinians to flee the jewish homeland and contrary to your belief many civilians were killed deir yassin was later advertized by the very jews who perpetrated it because it was useful in getting many palestinians to leave the palestinians were rightfully scared off because they did not want another deir yassin i m not necessarily condemning the israelites here atrocities were aslo committed on the part of the arabs israelophiles should just be careful in thinking that they are and were the good guys in the middle east both arab and jew suck equally rj s you say that there is no evidence that what motivated the irgun to attack dir yassin was its strategic importance in fact begin who was in charge of the irgun wrote that dir yassin was attacked for its military significance dir yassin was merely a battle in the war of liberation people died but the thing was never intended to be a masacre that this hapenned is a tragedy of war not a crime of the irgun harry i agree with you harry however you must also concede then that arab terrorism is also a tragedy of war remember that the palestinians have no other effective target but civilians in order to further their cause if irgun had to attack civilian targets to terrorize in order that they might obtain some objective i m sure they would have done so i also don t exclude irgun s action against british soldiers as terrorism the british were showing signs of favoring a compromise with regards to palestine and the irgun and branch off groups made a point to kill young british recruits so that mothers and fathers back in britain would get angry at britains continued presence in palestine sounds like a form of terrorism to me and not much removed from arab terrorism we must not also forget that irgun or irgun branch off groups more likely killed many jews who were not as hardline zionist as they or who cooperated with the british i ll reiterate again both sides are screwy but i ll favor the underdog in this case because i do think they were a bit screwed

re final solution for gaza in article igc apc org center for policy research cpr igc apc org writes there are basically three alternatives for gaza what is this gaza are you purposely separating it from the west bank if so why separate the people and territories if not why are you just addressing gaza here to throw the jews to the sea that is basically to make them leave the middle east and go back to where they came from russia europe usa etc by all means continue to list the etc the reason i particularly bring this up here is that there are many from middle eastern and west asian countries that fact in itself adds an important element to any consideration of resolution of the arab israel conflict to throw the gazans into the sea in accordance with yitzhak rabin s wish and that of many zionists you explained what sea meant with regard to the israelis jews please do so in this case for israelis and palestinians to come to an honorable and fair i don t attempt to say just settlement just you better not ask for that because that would mean north american tribes would be returned their lands the pre islamic tribes would take back their lands from the islamic invaders the saxons get to kick the normans out of the uk the central and south american tribes get to kick the spanish descendents out of thier lands and once we have returned the land to those who last possessed it we have to find out from whom they stole it at some point every culture stole the land they are on from previous occupants which would allow each person to live in dignity in his country in freedom and equality but wait now you refer to palestinians so what happened to gaza i personnaly opt for the third alternative how about you folks as we both know most people would choose the third alternative and since you have done so in the past perhaps you would initiate things by presenting your vision of resolution in doing so however the worries not paranioas worries and resonable expectations of both parties should be considered elias tim clock ph d graduate student uci tel department of politics and society fax university of california irvine home tel irvine ca

the elders of zion next unlike the plo s almost exclusive focus on civilian targets at this time the plo did not exist and would not for the next years you knew that didn t you perhaps you might want to add up all the jewish civilians killed during the war i ll opt for the massacre at deir yassin which do you think is the greater in however eric silver of the guardian britain interviewed a survivor mophammed sammour who testified that out of a population of were killed while we are talking about this man i have included more of his testimony that harry naturally does not use nor does myths and facts i wonder why no doubt he was lying right harry the reason was mainly economic that is to capture booty in order to maintain the bases which we had then established with very poor resources the main idea despite this remained the conquest of the village by force of arms something which was then unknown in the country and became a turning point in jewish military operations yehuda lapidot jabontinsky archives testimony apart from the military discussion the lehi put forward a proposal to liqui date the residents of the village after the conquest in order to show the arabs what happens when the izl and the lehi set out together on an operation and for another main reason it would cause a great uproar throughout the land and would be an important turning point in the course of the battles the clear aim was to break the arab morale and raise somewhat the morale of the jewish commu nity in jerusalem which had been hit hard time after time especially recenctly by the desecration of jewish bodies which fell into arab hands yehuda lapidot jabotinsky archives testimony as quoted by yisrael segal in the deir yassin file published by koteret rashit th january so it wasn t like the holocaust more like lidice a warning a punishment collective and inflicted on unarmed innocents just not as through when it comes to prisoners old people and children there were differences of opinion but the majority was for liquidation of all the men in the village and any other force that opposed us whether it be old people women or children benzion cohen commander of the attack on deir yassin j a t let me put in some words here a premeditated b murder what do you say about the eyewitness testimony of the man in command we had prisoners and before the retreat we decided to liquidate them we also liquidated the wounded as anyway we could not give them first aid in one place about eighty arab prisoners were killed after some of them had opened fire and killed one of the people who came to give them first aid arabs who dressed up as arab women were also found and so they started to shoot the women also who did not hurry to the area where the prisoners were concentrated j a t shooting prisoners the wounded as a warning to hurry sounds very familiar to me how about you heard of other people other places doing these things in one case the zahran family only one out of twenty five survived in another house they caught the sixteen year old son fuad his mother was holding him they killed him with a knife the mother spent twenty years after that in a mental hospital a young woman and her two year old baby were shot in the street their bodies were left there they moved to the centre of the village and started to kill everybody they saw or heard as soon as anybody opened his door they were using bombs grenades machine guns submachine guns my cousin escaped with bullet holes in his clothes one of the officers put his machinegun through a window and started shooting outwards killing everybody who moved they killed my uncle ali hassan zeidan and my aunt fatima she heard him call help me she ran to him and they killed her another neighbour haj yarah heard some voices and came out they killed him too his son muhammad who was about seventeen heard his father call him and went to the same place they killed him his mother heard her son cry for help she ran out and they killed her that was near my house i saw this muhammad arif sammour funny how myths and facts does not see fit to include this too after all if he is reliable enough to report casualties why not the actual events what do you say about this harry in the exchange that followed four men were killed and a dozen were wounded by noon time the battle was over and the shooting had ceased although there was a calm the village had not yet surrendered the irgun and lehi men came out of hiding and began to clean the houses they shot whoever they saw women and children included the commanders did not try and stop the massacre i pleaded with the commander to order his men to cease fire but to no avail in the meantime twenty five arabs had been loaded on a truck and driven through

want to convince anyone this is just usenet not the real world i just read the opinions others have about a subject and sometimes i present my opinion i think that this net is only useful to exchange ideas i never wanted nor i want now to convince anyone of anything fine now if your opinion isn t convincing anyone and it s getting refuted regularly by the facts which is the case isn t it likely that your opinions need some revision as i said i do not want to convice anyone so why should my opinions convince anyone i do not believe that my opinions are refuted by facts first and i repeat it i never said that the idea of jews having the right to have a state is racist zionism as a movement is more than just that idea in a word utter and complete horse puckey look the term up in the dictionary maybe youy view of a dictionary is the problem here one thing is the accepted meaning of a word by a dictionary and sometimes a completely different thing is what that word came to mean after a long time i think that zionism in the way it defines who is a jew for example is racist like ok now how would you define it and by the way you re wrong again there is no uniformity of this definition among zionist movements you know this is the case it s been pointed out on the net directly to you before and yet you continue to maintain this delusion ok tell me how many people in zionist movements define a jew in a different way and how many are who define jew based on a religious way in the same way i believe that irish have a right to nationalism but i do not support the bombing and killing of the ira i believe that jews have a right to nationalism but i do not support zionism as it is right now comparing the actions of israel to that of the ira is like comparing those of the us to those of chile under pinochet for example with the ira in the role of pinochet you really need to get your history straight you also need a basic dictionary you need to start reading before answering my point was that because some movement claims to be nationalistic it does not mean that i consider it to be nationalistic i did not comapre israel to the ira i think that you are starting to put words on my mouth and that is wrong stuff deleted by pinkas his statement which i was responding to with the below asserted that zionism was uniform and monolithic i never said that zionism is monolithic if you are going to attribute me things present the quotes where i said that that is what makes the basis for zionist movements however i am not considering just that but the rest of it in a word i don t believe you your words tell a very different story especially since they are not based on fact but innuendo and misrepresentation that is your problem i could certainly interpret this like you are running out of arguments first you put words in my mouth now you say you do ot believe me which makes an interesting point people living in a jewish state have shown that jewish culture includes in it jewish religion but they are not the same so the jewish people living in the jewish state have shown us that there are some problems in a state where of the people is secular but judaism is define according to religious standards or where marriage is a religious stage or where the law of return defines a jew according to a religious standard no it doesn t nowhere does the law of return demand that one must be religious or even believe in g d to become a citizen of israel thereunder why don t you try reading for a change did i say that the law of return demand a person to be religious now how does the law of return define who is a jew and who is not i said that it uses a religious standard if your mother is a jew you are a jew if your mother is not jewish neither you are do not twist my words please true there are debates in israel and abroad about who is a jew but those debates are taken up by both religious and secular would you say that religious people should not have a say in that would you deny them their right of free speech i am not talking about the debate i am talking about how things are right now when the debate is over i ll see what happens right now things are like they are let me ask you one thing i understand that israel differenciates between citizenship and nationality suppose m ale and f emale have a child in israel which nationality will the child s id show according to each one of the following cases a f and m are both jewish b f is jewsh and m is not c f is muslim and m is jewish d f is christian and m is jewish e f and m are both non jewish did those israelis who do not believe in god and will never do become non jews why should they still define then a jew based on what is a religious definition it s called history how do you think jews stuck together through pogroms for millenia in europe we had to know who was our own i for one do think that some change is in order and that patrilineal descent is no less legit than is matrilineal which is not the religious jew s point of view there s plenty of room for that in zionism as you well know it called history at some point it was ok now i believe it is not according to webster s ninth new collegiate dictionary merriam webster inc publishers springfield massachusetts u s a page hy poc ri sy a feigning to be what one is nnot or to believe one does not so saying that one believes in zionism as a simple matter of people having the right to nationalism but disregarding the right of the palestinian people to do the same according to this dictionary is hypocrisy utter baloney by the way i do believe the palestinians have a right to self determination have stated so on this net and i know you ve seen it interesting how do you know had i ever talked to you about this and forgotten about that but that right to self determination cannot be at israel s expense israel s security comes first and that security must be maintained you re also twisting words now beyond belief if you think that s what that definition means in this context you need a first grade course in english which definition are you now talking here about i do not know why you are so touchy i never said that you did not support palestinian self determination i just gave an example of hypocrisy i never said that someone in this net is guilty of it it was just an example nothing more nothing less than that why did you have to clarify what you think if you didn t use different meanings of words than are in the dictionary you might be believable here you have several problems first you should know that words have more meanings than those given in the dictionary second it may come to be a shock for you to know that there are more words than those in the dictionary third we can exchange ideas if you want but you come out with this nonsense about being believable using the definitions given in a dictionary it seems that you cannot answer to the ideas given by others without insulting others sad if your facts at all resembled even the slightest bit of truth which they do not you might be believable if you did not put words in my mouth it might be that you might start reading what i had actually said so far you come over and over twisting what i said or presenting things i never said as if i had said them in this way you are answering to yourself that is why you do not find it believable maybe if you start reading what i had actually said and not what you added you might change your mind but the fact is that there is nothing resembling fact in what you ve said on this thread and the fact also is that you re using different definitions for your words based on baloney than anyone else does first there is nothing resembling a fact in what you added to what i said as if i had said it seconf anyone else is supposed to mean than i do eric s perlman perlman qso colorado edu center for astrophysics and space astronomy

article slo e ag cville srv wam umd edu aap wam umd edu alberto adolfo pinkas writes i do not want to convince anyone this is just usenet not the real world i just read the opinions others have about a subject and sometimes i present my opinion i think that this net is only useful to exchange ideas i never wanted nor i want now to convince anyone of anything fine now if your opinion isn t convincing anyone and it s getting refuted regularly by the facts which is the case isn t it likely that your opinions need some revision as i said i do not want to convice anyone so why should my opinions convince anyone i do not believe that my opinions are refuted by facts then you haven t been paying attention to the arguments levelled against them they have been over and over again they will be again first and i repeat it i never said that the idea of jews having the right to have a state is racist zionism as a movement is more than just that idea in a word utter and complete horse puckey look the term up in the dictionary maybe youy view of a dictionary is the problem here one thing is the accepted meaning of a word by a dictionary and sometimes a completely different thing is what that word came to mean after a long time hey what do you think dictionaries are for you quite obviously need one a good dictionary gives both and you well know it i think that zionism in the way it defines who is a jew for example is racist like ok now how would you define it and by the way you re wrong again there is no uniformity of this definition among zionist movements you know this is the case it s been pointed out on the net directly to you before and yet you continue to maintain this delusion ok tell me how many people in zionist movements define a jew in a different way and how many are who define jew based on a religious way i don t think that data exist on this directly in the same way i believe that irish have a right to nationalism but i do not support the bombing and killing of the ira i believe that jews have a right to nationalism but i do not support zionism as it is right now comparing the actions of israel to that of the ira is like comparing those of the us to those of chile under pinochet for example with the ira in the role of pinochet you really need to get your history straight you also need a basic dictionary you need to start reading before answering my point was that because some movement claims to be nationalistic it does not mean that i consider it to be nationalistic i did not comapre israel to the ira i think that you are starting to put words on my mouth and that is wrong that is no problem but once again you are defining zionism as one movement you are implying that it is monolithic you know this is not and has never been the case stuff deleted by pinkas his statement which i was responding to with the below asserted that zionism was uniform and monolithic i never said that zionism is monolithic if you are going to attribute me things present the quotes where i said that you don t say it directly you implied it and i showed explicitly where and how you implied it now you re trying to wriggle out of it won t wash and you know it that is what makes the basis for zionist movements however i am not considering just that but the rest of it in a word i don t believe you your words tell a very different story especially since they are not based on fact but innuendo and misrepresentation that is your problem i could certainly interpret this like you are running out of arguments first you put words in my mouth now you say you do ot believe me it s you not me who is running out of arguments which makes an interesting point people living in a jewish state have shown that jewish culture includes in it jewish religion but they are not the same so the jewish people living in the jewish state have shown us that there are some problems in a state where of the people is secular but judaism is define according to religious standards or where marriage is a religious stage or where the law of return defines a jew according to a religious standard no it doesn t nowhere does the law of return demand that one must be religious or even believe in g d to become a citizen of israel thereunder why don t you try reading for a change did i say that the law of return demand a person to be religious now how does the law of return define who is a jew and who is not i said that it uses a religious standard if your mother is a jew you are a jew if your mother is not jewish neither you are do not twist my words please what you said is that judaism is defined according to religious standards now this can have several different meanings and you know it one of the meanings that it can have is to say that only those who are religious are defined as jews another is to say that only those who meet the religious definition of a jew is one and there are others i m not twisting your words i m trying to make you aware that your words don t mean what you think they do true there are debates in israel and abroad about who is a jew but those debates are taken up by both religious and secular would you say that religious people should not have a say in that would you deny them their right of free speech i am not talking about the debate i am talking about how things are right now when the debate is over i ll see what happens right now things are like they are let me ask you one thing i understand that israel differenciates between citizenship and nationality suppose m ale and f emale have a child in israel which nationality will the child s id show according to each one of the following cases actually it doesn t and the citizens rights are exactly the same in both cases anyway a f and m are both jewish jewish b f is jewsh and m is not jewish c f is muslim and m is jewish d f is christian and m is jewish it ll depend on what religion is practiced in the house the original law of return would still admit such a person if they were jewish if memory serves e f and m are both non jewish not jewish did those israelis who do not believe in god and will never do become non jews why should they still define then a jew based on what is a religious definition it s called history how do you think jews stuck together through pogroms for millenia in europe we had to know who was our own i for one do think that some change is in order and that patrilineal descent is no less legit than is matrilineal which is not the religious jew s point of view there s plenty of room for that in zionism as you well know it called history at some point it was ok now i believe it is not that s valid as far as i can see according to webster s ninth new collegiate dictionary merriam webster inc publishers springfield massachusetts u s a page hy poc ri sy a feigning to be what one is nnot or to believe one does not so saying that one believes in zionism as a simple matter of people having the right to nationalism but disregarding the right of the palestinian people to do the same according to this dictionary is hypocrisy utter baloney by the way i do believe the palestinians have a right to self determination have stated so on this net and i know you ve seen it interesting how do you know had i ever talked to you about this and forgotten about that more than once as have others but that right to self determination cannot be at israel s expense israel s security comes first and that security must be maintained you re also twisting words now beyond belief if you think that s what that definition means in this context you need a first grade course in english which definition are you now talking here about the very one you give above it is absolutely inconsistent with the twist you put on it i do not know why you are so touchy i never said that you did not support palestinian self determination i just gave an example of hypocrisy no you didn t you had to twist the definition of the word degrees in order to do so and everyone else knows it i m not being touchy i never said that someone in this net is guilty of it it was just an example nothing more nothing less than that why did you have to clarify what you think because what you gave was not an example it was an example of how the definition of a word can be twisted around degrees if you didn t use different meanings of words than are in the dictionary you might be believable here you have several problems first you should know that words have more meanings than those given in the dictionary oh so now what are dictionaries for second it may come to be a shock for you to know that there are more words than those in the dictionary duh as a scientist whose technical terms are very often not found in common dictionaries i know this but when a term is common like hypocrisy a good dictionary can be regarded as an authoritative source third we can exchange ideas if you want but you come out with this nonsense about being believable using the definitions given in a dictionary it s not nonsense when people read what you write they have to try to associate a meaning to those words dictionaries give the meanings of words don t they now i assume that you d like to have the words you use mean what you d like them to but the fact is you re using very different meanings than are in the dictionary or you would like the reader to assign them new meanings which they never had it seems that you cannot answer to the ideas given by others without insulting others sad not at all what i cannot abide is utter bombast when you ve been proven completely wrong if your facts at all resembled even the slightest bit of truth which they do not you might be believable if you did not put words in my mouth it might be that you might start reading what i had actually said i never put even one syllable in your mouth you have tried to prove this and you failed so far you come over and over twisting what i said or presenting things i never said as if i had said them poppycock in this way you are answering to yourself that is why you do not find it believable maybe if you start reading what i had actually said and not what you added you might change your mind i read what you said i did not add anything you simply either don t know that the words don t mean what you d like them to which cannot be the case now since you ve been proven wrong and you quite obviously don t have a defense against the arguments presented or you re twisting the meanings which is it but the fact is that there is nothing resembling fact in what you ve said on this thread and the fact also is that you re using different definitions for your words based on baloney than anyone else does first there is nothing resembling a fact in what you added to what i said as if i had said it ha there s nothing resembling fact in what you ve said i never added anything to what you said how sad to see a model of decorum

what that word came to mean after a long time hey what do you think dictionaries are for you quite obviously need one a good dictionary gives both and you well know it i could give you hundreds of words in my mother tongue spanish that are comonly use and you will never find in a dictionary even more i could show you a lot of meanings that words in spanish have different from those in the dictionary ok tell me how many people in zionist movements define a jew in a different way and how many are who define jew based on a religious way i don t think that data exist on this directly and guess why isn t it curious that we do not know how many people define in how many different ways the term jew which is the basis of the movement itself so the evidence shows that up to now jew when considered in terms of israel the law of return and jewish nationality is defined in terms of religion and not of cultural identity even if of those defined as jews in isreal are not religious in the same way i believe that irish have a right to nationalism but i do not support the bombing and killing of the ira i believe that jews have a right to nationalism but i do not support zionism as it is

movement you are implying that it is monolithic you know this is not and has never been the case that is a problem i am saying that i do not support zionism as it is now i believe that among the people in the soviet communist party some might even had been inspired by noble ideals does that change the final results of what happened in the ussr in the same way even if the zionist movement is not homogeneous it does not matter what matters is the result i never said that zionism is monolithic if you are going to attribute me things present the quotes where i said that you don t say it directly you implied it and i showed explicitly where and how you implied it now you re trying to wriggle out of it won t wash and you know it i never said it directly nor indirectly i am not talking about individuals who defined themselves as zionists here i am sure most of them are good honest and caring people i am talking about the results of the zionist movement i am talking about a movement whose actions resulted in a law of return with a religious definition of jew a country that defines nationality based on religion i am talking about something i consider a form of racism such as differenciation based on religious belief after all if arabs in israel cannot serve in the army is becasue they were not born in the right religion what you said is that judaism is defined according to religious standards now this can have several different meanings and you know it one of the meanings that it can have is to say that only those who are religious are defined as jews another is to say that only those who meet the religious definition of a jew is one and there are others i m not twisting your words i m trying to make you aware that your words don t mean what you think they do i had never heard the definition only those who are religious are defined as jews i had always seen the definition a person is a jew is his her mother is was a jew and if such person does not convert

support zionism and then disregard the palestinian s right i never said that someone in this net is guilty of it it was just an example nothing more nothing less than that why did you have to clarify

definition of zionism and in this post you have showed for me what i was telling you from the begining zionism is a form of racism even if most zionists are not racist in their individual and private lifes a movement that ask for a state and national rights for a people and then in practice that people are defined according to religion is for me racist like i never put even one syllable in your

re mosque in jewish quarter was re israeli destruction of in article dfs dax dfs doe carleton ca david f skoll writes when i was in jerusalem a couple of years ago our guide told us the story of that mosque not sure if it was true apparently it was built by a jewish convert to islam he had had a dispute with his neighbours and built the mosque davka to annoy them it s a cute story but not sure if it s true if he gives you the same story explaining the presence of several synagogues in the moslem quarter then the story becomes suspect in reality the old city was not as neighborhooded in the past as it became after in pre israel jerusalem there were many jews in what is now called the moslem quarter there are postal and telephone directories from that time to prove it it s really rather interesting to hear arabs there claim that a house or store has been in the family for centuries even when there are clear photos and documents that show a jewish owned business at the same location just a few decades ago jake livni jake bony bony com ten years from now george bush will american occupied new york have replaced jimmy carter as the my opinions only employer has no opinions standard of a failed president
re israel an apartheid state in article smllm m cville srv wam umd edu aap wam umd edu alberto adolfo pinkas writes in article may pasteur berkeley edu adams bellini berkeley edu adam l schwartz writes which was my point by converting to another religion i do not loose my cultural identity i just loose my religious identification i consider that defining the belonging to a nation that claims the right to have a state based on religious belief is a form of racism to be a part or not of the jeish nation is defined by my culture and not by my religion actually if i am an atheist which is in fact like converting into a non jewish in terms of religion i am still considered as part of the jewish nation i can be proud of my jewish culture while not giving any importance to the jewish religion or even more i can be proud of my jewish culture while still be convinced that the real god is another one i do not know anyone who lost his memebership to the american nation because he changed of god alberto you ve repeatedly misunderstood my postings you are now making the exact point that i ve made several times but with a different definition of religion you don t not have to believe in the religious aspects of judaism to be a jew this would confine judaism to be just a religion in the sense of a christianity so by converting out of judaism i don t mean just not believing in the god of judaism i mean voluntarily removing yourself from the jewish nation i am an agnostic but still consider myself jewish because of my cultural heritage i admit that many religious jews would argue that i am not completely jewish because of my lack of faith but judaism is a religion of dissent and debate isn t it the fact that one can opt to become jewish simply by converting to judaism makes the nation of the jewish people the least racist and most open nation we have no quotas so i will once again make my point defining a member of the jewish nation by religion not as you say religious belief is not racism you come to your incorrect conclusion because you use a different definition for religion when you define the law of return and when you define judaism adam schwartz

home at the time igor and i and our two children ira and edik and their daughter my sister in law ira and my mother and father in law and the ambartsumian family there were three of them uncle misha zhasmen and their daughter marina now when they started breaking down the door i remember edik and igor told us go in that room and close the door close the door and calm the children so they won t hear that there s anyone home the children started crying suddenly ira my brother in law s wife suggested let s run out onto the balcony we the two daughters in law and the children and zhasmen and marina raced out onto the balcony my sister in law and my mother in law ran in and said quick over to the other balcony or they ll kill you all we lived on the second floor we needed to cross over from our balcony to our neighbor s at first we couldn t manage it the balcony looked onto the street at that time people were coming home from work and many just stood there watching i pleaded and begged please call someone have someone come i even started shouting i ll throw down the children i ll throw them down you catch them and take them somewhere so at least the children will survive either they were afraid or i don t know what they looked as though they were watching a movie some of them started throwing stones at us i ll say it again these weren t the bandits these were people from the other part of the building and from our entryway they were just regular people passersby a bus even stopped i remember a man s voice saying the armenians were climbing over to the other balcony ira my sister in law helped us get the children over there i was pregnant about seven months pregnant no it wasn t yet seven it was six and a half i climbed over too i think zhasmen went first you know i just don t remember it all that well zhasmen went first i think and edik s wife ira and i had the children and they were all screaming and crying my kristina said mamma don t throw us over the balcony we re afraid lilia was crying and kristina and seryozha were crying too kristina didn t even want to climb over she shouted i m staying with grandmother i m staying with grandma she loved her grandma more than she loved me and my mother in law shouted oh no kristina s still there she s still there save kristina too ira helped us climb over with kristina coming last ira helped us and went back inside we started pounding on the neighbor s balcony door i pounded with my fist sevil open the door open it please she didn t open it no go away go anywhere go i m not opening the door she was our neighbor we were friends we never refused her anything ever and apparently she thought we were going to break the windows and she opened the door she opened it and said karina karina go away go anywhere just don t stay here they ll kill us too because of you i begged please at least take the children we ll leave we ll go back no she said you have to leave her sons ran in one had a knife sevil s brother he s around shouted at us get out of here leave i ll kill you with this knife i became terrified i took the children and went out in the entryway and went down a few stairs i went down and heard a loudspeaker it was in the courtyard the armenians must be killed they ve taken all the best places all the best apartments one of them said let the armenian blood flow none of them should survive when i heard that i went upstairs and started knocking on doors no one opened their door for me not on the third floor or the fourth i couldn t see zhasmen any longer ira came upstairs later i even thought that they had let her stay that they would save her my head was spinning they were killing my family and here i was in the next entryway with two children seryozha was four and kristina was five and a half they were crying mamma we re scared they were so frightened that i didn t even know how to calm them should i try to calm them or myself it was awful but on the third floor a man did open his door i asked open up let me inside he opened the door slightly and said no no and that was it he said it so sternly no i went up to the fifth floor i pounded my fists on the door with all my might he opened up the man of the house and stood there looking at me i was ready to get down on my knees i almost did get down on my knees please i beg of you at least take the children he wasn t an azerbaijani he was a lezgin i don t even know how but he let me inside and when i went in zhasmen was already there two minutes hadn t passed when ira and lilia came up the stairs lilia was crying he didn t want to open the door and again i started pleading please open the door it s our ira and lilia open the door and he said no i m afraid i said again and again please open the door please he looked at me he looked at me for a long time and then opened the door after all ira came in with lilia we threw ourselves into each other s arms crying then the man locked us into the bathroom we sat there for a long time through the door he told us calm the children and calm yourselves down too calm down this man was hiding us but what of our family when i was still in our apartment i had sensed that none of us would come out of this alive i said igor edik let s say farewell and edik turned around and looked at me as if to say is that some kind of joke all the same i thought they would kill all of us igor looked at me too but it was already too late they started pounding on the door igor was standing next to the door before that he had told us go lock yourselves in that room and sit tight he thought we were in the room but before we went out onto the balcony we went to them edik igor let s say farewell igor didn t think we could climb over to the other balcony and we did get over there and i myself can t believe we were able to save ourselves igor put on a helmet and edik had his coat on and he put on a fur hat all the men igor edik their father and misha ambartsumian they all stood next to the door they thought they would pound on it a while and leave but from the other side of the door they ordered in azerbaijani open the door we were all silent waiting someone outside the door said they re home they re in there break down the door and i remember my father in law whispering they re going to break it down now it s coming down now he had something in his hands i think it was a knife if they got in we were going to defend ourselves in the hall near the door there were two metal chair legs from outside the door they said we re counting to five open up but we were all quiet we didn t answer them we made like no one was home we figured they d leave they d get tired and leave my father in law had said it s not possible they d come into my home how can that be everyone knows us all of sumgait knows our family we are on good terms with everyone and indeed a day did not pass that there wasn t an azerbaijani guest at our table we had a nice dacha everyone would get together there often azerbaijanis liked being with us there too but now we had to save ourselves we had to flee from our own home ira i remember said i m not leaving here my brothers and my parents are here i m going to fight alongside them that s just what she said she picked up a knife and said if they open the door and come into the apartment then i m going to fight alongside my family i m not going anywhere we were at sevil s when they broke into our apartment we heard fighting and shouting the noise was terrible and when we hid upstairs on the fifth floor at the lezgin s apartment you could hear everything up there too even ira s voice i remember her calling her mother several times she called her for a long time i started pounding on the door in the bathroom open the door what are they doing to ira who s shouting that s ira shouting that s her voice but the lezgin said it s nothing calm down no it s not in your apartment he was lying to me so i d calm down two hours went by and the lezgin opened the door and said karina igor got away calm down he ran away he saw igor break away and run off with his own eyes they killed him outside next to the building while we were in the bathroom i experienced every possible human terror the way ira shouted she shouted save me mamma save me mamma mamma she repeated it several times there was a wild din there were very many people there all of them shouting all of them bellowing howling whistling you just can t imagine what was going on what the roar was like apparently after they had killed ira those murderers came into the entryway where we were hiding and came upstairs all the way up to the fifth floor i don t know if they were just looking for any armenians or for us in particular but i think they were looking for us because when we had climbed over the balconies someone on the street was saying that the daughters in law were climbing over the balconies and after we heard ira we heard them coming up the stairs in the entryway and hammering on the doors i thought those were our last moments and started saying good bye to my children kissing them they were sleeping i woke them up kristina seryozha wake up and i tell ira ira if something happens we ll throw ourselves off the balcony we were on the fifth floor apparently our lezgin neighbor had opened the door too because later he said i opened the door and told them there were no armenians inside and after they all left our neighbor went out on the balcony himself to see they were gone we weren t friends with those lezgin neighbors we only knew each other from the building but the people we were friends with wouldn t even consider hiding us the lezgin let us out of the bathroom they had a candle burning he said karina there re no lights on in our block the whole block was dark the whole block it s a huge block too the lezgin said i m afraid to keep you until morning i m afraid of the neighbors they might kill me for saving you i said what are you saying we ll leave now but we can t just leave with the children in the middle of the night give us time to find somewhere else to hide he said well ok go look i asked ira ira do you want to go ira said no i ll stay with the children karina i said fine then i ll go zhasmen and i went downstairs together it was very dark no one was in the courtyard it was dark pitch black l was afraid to go out at after seven igor always met me after work and accompanied me home i never went out alone and now here i was out in the middle of the night and after a slaughter like that too it was probably after eleven later i called the boarding school and my director answered he said karina where are you i didn t know i was calling from a public phone outside and didn t know where i was i got confused and hung up the receiver from him i only found out what time it was i asked him what time is it he said i think but i don t really remember so anyway zhasmen and i went out into the courtyard i look and see what appears to be a person not far from our apartment and there was the smell of something burnt i became horrified i looked at the corpse for a long time it was either ira or edik i only saw one of them zhasmen grabbed my hand and squeezed it hurry up let s go hurry up come on what are you turning around for i turned around and saw a large truck it must have belonged to the bandits because they came to kill us in a truck like that we lived in the third entryway and that truck was next to the fourth we walked quickly holding hands i thought if i go to the police then they ll put me away i couldn t count on them before i reached the police station i saw a military vehicle we went over and i said soldier in block i don t know if they ve killed people or injured them we need to save them and he said go to the police station and tell them everything i said i m afraid to go there i m afraid of them he said don t be afraid we went to the police and they wrote down the address and the military vehicle went to our building i didn t go with them they left me at the police station i gave the addresses of my mother and my brothers so that they d rescue them too i didn t know where they were or what had happened to them after a while they brought my children and ira and lilia first they took us to the kgb that was at two or three in the morning then around five they took us to the city party committee and there were very many people there very many i was pregnant and was wearing nothing but a dress seryozha was only wearing a shirt and kristina had a little dress on no coat no boots nothing and we sat there for three whole days in the city party committee the lezgin had told me that igor escaped and i thought that he was probably alive but then after two and a half days they took us the armenians of sumgait to nasosny on march some people from the central committee came and told us karina ira we need you come with us to the city party committee my mamma had come to nasosny and she had been looking for me for six days mama my brothers and my uncle we went to the city party committee and waited there in the courtyard i was wearing nothing but a dress and ira had only a dress on as well there was a strong wind on march an hour went by and then one of the functionaries told us karina ira gather your courage would you like to go to the burial i said what did they really kill all of them he said let s look he had a long list and he started reading them off igor melkumian my husband eduard melkumian my brother in law irina melkumian my sister in law sogomon melkumian my father in law and raisa melkumian my mother in law he read off all their names and said get in the car let s go to the burial we buried our family i couldn t believe it at the time i couldn t conceive of it or imagine it and even now i think how shall i explain it to my children when they re older my children were very attached to their father and their grandfather and grandmother kristina didn t love me the way she loved her grandfather and grandmother they spoiled her kristina would always announce my grandma is better than anyone now even though she is getting used to my mother it s difficult for her and once she told her you re a bad grandmother i don t know why i asked her kristina where s papa and she said they killed him she knows she understands it all

re israel an apartheid state i think there are some generally accepted criteria according to which one can evaluate whether certain policies or practices constitute racial discrimination these criteria are to be found for example in the international convention for abolition of all forms of racial discrimination ratified by most countries the international covenant of political and civil rights the human rights charter the european convention of human rights if one reads carefully how racial discrimination is defined in these legally binding instruments and does not resort to sophistry it is obvious that the state of israel is guilty of racial discrimination the people suffering the most extreme form of racial discriminatnion by the zionist regime are the palestinian refugees some of whom live under israeli military control and others who live in the diaspora they are not entitled to return to their homeland for the sole reason that they are not jews international law does not include any provisions which permits such denial of rights under any circumstance israel s actions of denial are totally illegal and immoral by allowing the return of the refugees and permitting them to settle in tel in any area of the state of israel the state would finally gain its legitimaty under international law and could be justified in asking to be recognized it would facilitate the peaceful integration of israel into the middle east and constitute the best guarantee for permanent jewish presence in the area any attempt to create a separation formal and human between the israeli jewish and palestinian arab communities is fraught with genociadal implications i hope that u s jews who sincerely wish that peace prevail in israel palestine will finally realize this fact elias davidsson ps please read carefully the first post in this topic where the facts of zionist racial discrimination are described

labour s enclaves policy important from center for policy research cpr subject labour s enclaves policy important labour s enclaves policy in the occupied territories by israel shahak publ in middle east international london it is not difficult to discover israel s policy towards the palestinians at any given time it can be easily inferred from the facts on the ground and from the information provided by the hebrew press there is one condition though the torrents of claptrap about the peace process must be totally ignored as must israel s official pronouncements whole sole purpose is to distort reality by concentrating only on the facts it was early apparent that labour s policies were no different from those of shamir but for their greater reliance on deceit and their more effective implementation likud s policies were accurately described by ariel sharon in an article accompanied by a map in yediot aharonot last august the sharon plan envisaged a division of the west bank into seven and the gaza strip into four autonomous palestinian enclaves all of them under israeli supervision the total area of these enclaves amounted to about per cent of the territories the rest was to be controlled by the israeli settlements and the highways built around the enclaves the entire area around jerusalem from the outskirts of ramallah to the boundaries of bethlehem has already been turned into a greater jerusalem where the arab inhabited localities amount to small enclaves surrounded by areas occupied by israeli settlements or reserved for them judging from labour s settlement policy it may be assumed that it may content itself with a lesser number of arab enclaves of a rather larger size than sharon had planned but the principle of surrounding the enclaves by settlements strategically dispersed along the highways remains unchanged labour plans only four enclaves in the west bank two in samaria and two in judea i e north and south of jerusalem respectively and no more than two in the gaza strip in regard to greater jerusalem labour s policies hardly deviate from sharon s a saner version of likud policy as some israeli correspondents at once realised labour policies were but a saner version of sharon s extravaganza last july gideon eshet wrote in yediot aharonot that while barely a few months ago labour supported the demand to freeze all construction beyond the green line no specific decision to freeze construction in the territories has been taken and uzi benziman wrote in ha aretz that as far as can be judged on the basis of the internal political discussions in jerusalem rabin intends to stick to likud s ways the two biggest enclaves envisaged by labour are located in samaria therefore the belt of settlements around the trans samaria highway designed to separate those enclaves from each other is of paramount importance according to the latest data the percentage of israeli settlers in the entire west bank population apart from east jerusalem is a mere per cent but for the area around the trans samaria highway the corresponding figure is almost per cent and it is increasing steadily the situation in the settlements of the efrat block south of jerusalem designed to sever the enclave around bethlehem from the one around hebron is pretty much the same the efrat block is now being connected with west jerusalem by a highway the project is costly in the extreme because the highway is designed to bypass bethlehem by a sequence of long tunnels the final decision to build this highway was suspended until rabin s return from his us visit in march the subsequent decision to renew its construction can be seen as us approval for the enclaves plan as a whole process of impoverishment the enclaves plan implies deliberate and steady impoverishment of the palestinians this is well known in israel but ignored abroad by all who should be concerned including the plo in regard to the gaza strip the whole process was best described by ze ev shiff in ha aretz in march he mentions having seen a pamphlet issued six years ago by the civil administration forecasting the conditions in the gaza strip under israeli rule in his analysis deserves to be quoted extensively we continue to steal the strip s water even though its quality deteriorates from year to year we continue to steal the strip s tiny land resources in order to found there more and more settlements as if we deliberately want to make the inhabitants despair and in their despair think in termws of having nothing to lose it is by our own doing that the strip s workers must now spend travelling to their workplaces almost as much time as they spend working from the military point of view we have kept control of no more than half the strip s area at an increasingly exorbitant price in manpower and resources about a year before moshe arens left the defence ministry i heard him saying that we should withdraw from the strip come what may his argument was that israel sinks into the strip ever deeper and deeper he told me he had proposed this to yitzhak shamir but he rejected it yitzhak rabin rejects it too enormous state support for the qatif block settlers can also be cited as proof that the enclaves plan is being implemented the qatif block settlements founded by the first rabin government of are intended to divide the gaza strip into two separate enclaves efraim davidi of davar had data showing how vital for israeli this enterprise is the qatif block is now producing per cent of israeli tomatoes destined for export and a substantial proportion of cut flowers he also deals with the subsidies the settlers receive considerably augmented by the present government owing to them housing units are cheap the present government does not spare efforts to recruit new settlers to the block any prospective settler will get a per cent mortgage for his house on top of a grant of shekels such data shows that israel s plans apply whether the palestinians of the gaza strip are allowed or forbidden to work in israel the economic motivations were explained by danny rubinstein in ha aretz in march from the economic viewpoint gaza could already be sealed off hermetically and all the strip s workers could be barred from entering israel even though accurate data is hard to come by it is indisputable that during the last two years the numbes of gazan workers arriving daily to work in israel has markedly decreased from in the mid s to today but the decrease is not only due to restrictions imposed on entering israel from gaza it is also due to the drastic curtailment of demand for gazan labour in israel with unemployment in israel soaring and the construction of apartments blocks virtually halted the workers from gaza are no longer really needed gaza s total dependence the entire economy of the gaza strip is totally dependent on israel in recent years in the gaza strip there has been an increase in sub contracted work for israeli factories mostly footware and textiles thousands of small workshops employing an average of four workers get their raw materials or unfinished products together with detailed working instructions from israeli factories rubinstein attributes this development to the fact that the average wage in the gaza strip is merely per cent of that in the west bank which in turn stands at half the average wage in israel and besides the gazan employer does not pay any social security for his employees if the average wage in the gaza strip is just a fifth of that in israel the profits of israeli factories and even of palestinian sub contractors must be vast they are higher still when a gazan sub contractor provides labour to be performed at home with the family s help the livelihood of tens of thousands of gazans depends on such sub contracted work many of them are women and children paid about ten shekels a day which can last hours or more there can be no doubt that profits from exploiting cheap gazan labour are one of the reasons for the stubborn opposition of rabin and other israeli ministers to withdrawal from the strip economic conditions in the gaza strip differ little from what was created straight after israel s conquest in in this respect one should not be deluded by the talk nowadays fashionable about israeli gestures intended to encourage economic development in the territories as israeli journalists point out all permits for opening new businesses depend on a prior approval by the shin bet behind all the professed goodwill there is no desire to solve problems just the attitude of a good colonialist willing to do something for the benefit of the natives but on condition that they behave nicely do not become rebellious and never do anything against the interests of the metropolis its economic interests included wrote michal sela in davar in february the development of sub contracted work in the gaza strip accords perfectly with sela s diagnosis sela also shows how exactly the economic controls work in all branches of the economy lobbies have been set in motion for purposes of freeing israeli production from the threat of any palestinian competition the method is simplicity itself as soon as any israeli producer succeeds in persuading the government or even the trade and industry minister alone a military order is issued prohibiting the export of a given produce to israel if this does not suffice a palestinian factory may be denied a licence to operate or bureaucratic obstacles may paralyse its production among the most active of such lobbies is the agricultural one it has succeeded in limiting exports of gazan vegetables except for those grown by settlers not only to israel but also to europe where they otherwise might compete with israeli exports perpetuaring apartheid labour s goal is to perpetuate this apartheid regime in the territories the same goal is shared by the us which otherwise could not support the labour government so firmly in my view one of the reasons the us feels happier about supporting labour than likud is its greater efficiency in pursuing the settlement drive this point was brought home by ofer shelah in ma ariv who deplored the settlers failure which he attributed to likud s inefficiency he showed that the peak yearly settlement growth occured during the term of office of the national unity government i e in which rabin served throughout as the defence minister likud s reputation for settling the territories better than labour is false attributable to the many tiny settlements without strategic value founded under shamir for symbolic reasons to sum up labour s policy unconditionally supported by the us differs from that of likud primarily in the efficiency with which it is implemented according to that policy the territories are to be divided into two parts the major part is to be ruled by israel directly and the minor part indirectly in my view this racist scheme is doomed to ultimately fail but at a horrifying price in human suffering the sooner its true nature is recognised the less suffering it may cause

re kissenger says no in article befdde news service uci edu tclock orion oac uci edu tim clock writes you are right to notice my assumptions i should have used bosnian serbs and serbia and bosnian muslims in my post how quaint of you to point this out and then to completely ignore all of the blatant lies you ve trotted out the scenario and genocide staged by the armenians years ago in eastern anatolia and x soviet armenia is being reenacted again this time in azerbaijan there are remarkable similarities between the plots the perpetrators and the underdogs remember in article bac d news service uci edu you have blatantly lied and still have not corrected yourself the goltz article was not published in the sunday times magazine on march but in the guardian sunday section the story was not filed frim agdam but from london i ll let the rest of the net judge this on its own merits source the sunday times march a british weekly written by thomas goltz from agdam azerbaijan armenian soldiers massacre hundreds of fleeing families the spiralling violence gripping the outer republics of the former soviet union gained new impetus yesterday with cold blooded slaughter of hundreds of women and children in war racked nagorno karabakh survivors reported that armenian soldiers shot and bayoneted more than azeris many of them women and children who were fleeing an attack on their town hundreds possibly thousands were missing and feared dead the attackers killed most of the soldiers and volunteers defending the women and children they then turned their guns on the terrified refugees the few survivors later described what happened that s when the real slaughter began said azer hajiev one of three soldiers to survive the armenians just shot and shot and then they came in and started carving up people with their bayonets and knives they were shooting shooting shooting echoed rasia aslanova who arrived in agdam with other women and children who made their way through armenian lines she said her husband kayun and a son in law were killed in front of her her daughter was still missing one boy who arrived in agdam had an ear sliced off the survivors said others some of whom had fled separately were still missing in the gruelling terrain many could perish from their wounds or the cold by late yesterday deaths had been registered at the morgue in agdam s morgue and bodies had been buried in the cemetery of the seven corpses i saw awaiting burial two were children and three were women one shot through the chest at point blank range agdam hospital was a scene of carnage and terror doctors said they had patients who escaped slaughter most with bullet injuries or deep stab wounds nor were they safe in agdam on friday night rockets fell on the city which has a population of destroying several buildings and killing one person now wait there is more it s inhumane to ignore this violence the stories of survivors of karabag massacre year old hatin nine telling my twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes they told me we won t kill you but the babies have to die in front of your eyes year old huseyin ibrahimoglu our turkish village in khojalu town was blown up in two hours while killing children and babies mercilessly they said you are turks you must die year old gulsum huseyin they bayonetted my year old daughter in her stomach in front of my eyes are these stories lies have the eye witnesses been day dreaming were these stories forged by turkish journalists in the region the nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of british journalists too two days before we had quoted from a sunday times article they british reported the events in karabag even before turkish journalists what is more here are the pictures pictures of people who were bayonetted whose eyes were gouged ears cut off even the armenian radio couldn t claim these lies they are saying exaggeration that means somethings have happened but the situation is not as bad as reported perhaps that village of khojalu town was destroyed in hours instead of or gulsum huseyin s year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach the massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions the effects of this massacre on karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word some of the western press led by some french newspapers ability to close their eyes is nothing but complicity in this massacre yesterday we gave samples from le figaro until yesterday s print no news about the real events in karabag were printed so were the french tv channels the subject they considered related to karabag was the necessity of protecting armenians against azeri attacks the age we are living in is termed a human rights age there are lots of organizations such as united nations and csce conference on security and cooperation in europe and rules all designed to fight against human rights violations international reactions must be made with international cooperation with support of everybody and every organization claiming to be civilized could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the right to live and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty where is the cooperation where are the reactions and the intellectuals journalists writers tv stations of certain western countries such as france who are fast to claim leadership of human rights where are you serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination ohanus

re the greek authorities deny even the existence of a turkish minority in article may news uiowa edu mau herky cs uiowa edu mau napoleon writes a few thousand yup yes there are a few thousand left today after years of opression by turkey i expect better from you mau no i take that back i don t the treaty on the exchange of the turkish and greek minorities left no greek minority in turkiye except a few thousand greeks in istanbul turkiye is no longer an obstacle for pan hellenism although the material basis of greek policy is no longer visible there is a residue which seems to unite the pelopenisians the greeks who came from asia minor the greeks who are originally from the islands of the marmara sea or those who live in the numerous aegean islands this residue is also recognizable in the contemporary greek government as far a greek turkish wars are conserned i find it funny that a so informed turk like you forgot to mention the balkan wars not a chance greece lost in each and every war conducted solely between greece and turkiye in the morea in in thessaly in and in anatolia in after the ottoman empire lost world war i the british landed in a greek army in izmir to exterminate the people of turkiye are you suffering from a severe case of amnesia the tired and defeated turks rose up formed a national force under the leadership of mustafa kemal and on august they annihilated the bulk of the greek army turkiye is no longer an obstacle for pan hellenism besides greece lost in each and every war conducted solely between greece and turkiye in the morea in in thessaly in and in anatolia in especially the greek defeat referred to as the tragedy of anatolia by the greeks had momentous effects on greek mind and behaviour i find it curious that a historian like you forgot the wars that demolished the ottoman empire i love people who don t read and then spout myths as evidence where were greeks in and i guess they were busy with greek efforts to decimate the jewish population of salonica culminated in and those jews who survived these assaults in southeastern europe fled particularly to salonica whose jewish population increased substantially as a result from in to in more than half the total population though even there increased persecution by local greeks led many jews to flee elsewhere in the ottoman empire particularly to the great port of izmir despite all the pressure from ottomans and foreign jews alike the ritual murders and other assaults by christians on jews went on and on greek efforts to decimate the jewish population of salonica culminated in and following greek conquest of salonica during the first balkan war when many of its jews were either killed or terrorized into leaving though greece was obligated by the post world war i treaties to allow jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to practice their religions without hindrance a law was issued in which forbad all inhabitants from working on sunday stimulating a new jewish exodus as it was intended to do between and there was a series of anti semitic riots in salonica with the cambel quarter where most of the remaining jews lived being burned to the ground this was followed by regulations requiring the use of greek and prohibiting hebrew and judea spanish in the jewish schools a start was made also on expropriating the land of the principal jewish cemetery in salonica for use by the new university in order to derive the jews out by killing and driving out large numbers of jews the greeks left a substantial greek majority in the city for the first time and starting salonica jewry on the way to its final decimation by the nazis during the occupation of greece starting in salonica and izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for jewish refugees entering the empire during its last century of existence istanbul edirne and other parts of rumelia and anatolia received thousands more nor were jews the only refugees received and helped by the government of the sultan thousands of muslims accompanied them in flight from similar persecutions wherever balkan christian states gained independence or expanded the russian conquest of the crimea and the caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century and particularly during and after the crimean war combined with the same independence movements in southeastern europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among its jews caused thousands of helpless ill and poverty stricken muslim refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the ottoman empire with the istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly to house and feed them as best it could from to as many as crimean tatars circassians and other muslims from north and east of the black sea had entered anatolia alone as many as more came during the next twenty years while refugees entered in as a result of the ottoman wars with russia and the balkan states

re news that i missed some articles on the topic rtw gulf arabs demand iran withdrawal from islands eds updates with end of summit details quotes by youssef azmeh abu dhabi dec reuter gulf arab states emerging from a summit that restored their unity after almost three months of crisis piled pressure on iran on wednesday to reverse its virtual annexation of a strategic gulf island they issued a statement after a three day gulf cooperation council summit saying iran had to show proof of its good neighbourly intentions by rescinding measures that rocked gulf stability and security the leaders avoided the anti iranian rhetoric of recent statements by egypt which engineered a last minute settlement of a border row between saudi arabia and qatar that allowed all members to attend the summit egypt said its fears about iranian intentions in the region and tehran s alleged encouragement of moslem fundamentalist unrest were largely behind president hosni mubarak s mediation the gcc statement stressed that developing relations between the gulf arab states and iran is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures iran might take in line with its commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of the sovreignty and territorial integrity of the region s states it denounced iran s measures on the island of abu musa which it shares with the united arab emirates and the continued occupation of the greater and lesser tumbs islands iran earlier this year extended its control over abu musa beyond a small garrison it established there in under an agreement with the uae emirate of sharjah it has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the island for the uae government but diplomats say it continues to exercise its authority over the whole island which the uae sess as as virtual annexation the tumbs were occupied by the former shah of iran in and the uae has since the abu musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part of a general settlement the gcc leaders called on the u n to maintain sanctions against iraq for not fully implementing security council resolutions following its invasion of kuwait they endorsed once again the damascus declaration a pact signed with egypt and syria after their troops took part in the u s led alliance that drove iraqi troops out of kuwait but delegates said the leaders were unable to agree the details of a fund they announced they would create at their last summit in kuwait last year which would have helped egypt s and syria s economic development programme they said the leaders could not agree on a breakdown of contributions from each state although the total amount had been scaled down to billion from the billion agreed last year the fact that the leaders of all gcc states saudi arabia bahrain kuwait oman and qatar attended the summit was seen as a major achievement although their unity was only maintained with outside help most delegations were not too worried for the moment about the slow progress of the conservative rulers discussions on a future security structure for the region that boasts the bulk of global oil and gas reserves the leaders were unable to choose between two proposals one put forward by a summit committee headed by oman s sultan qaboos to create a man rapid deployment force that could rush to defend any member against external aggression such as iraq s invasion of kuwait another was a saudi supported plan to expand the existing man peninsula shield force which had so far played a largely symbolic role and is commanded by a saudi general little headway was made on plans for a reginal common market although the summit called for concrete proposals to be submitted to next year s summit due to be held in saudi arabia next december reuter ya dya djg rtw gulf leaders end summit abu dhabi dec reuter gulf arab states ended a three day annual summit on wednesday with an appeal to iran to end its occupation of three strategic gulf islands as a condition for restoring friendly ties across the gulf a joint statement issued after the summit marked by relief over the settlement of a row between two gulf cooperation council members also called for continued u n sanctions against iraq it said baghdad had failed to implement key security council decisions following the expulsion of its troops from kuwait early last year the summit broke no new ground on steps to achieve a gulf common market but called on officials to present a plan for common external tarrifs for all six members to the next summit which will be held in saudi arabia in december the statement stressed that developing relations between the gulf arab states and iran is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures iran might take in line with its commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of the sovreignty and territorial integrity of the region s states it denounced iran s measures on the island of abu musa which it shares with the united arab emirates and the continued occupation of the smaller islands the greater and lesser tumbs it expressed deep regret and extreme concern for the unjustified iranian measures which contradict a proclaimed wish to develop relations and called on iran to rescind those measures and end the occupation which it said was shaking peace and stability in the area iran earlier this year extended its control over abu musa beyond a small garrison it established there in under an agreement with the uae emirate of sharjah it has since rescinded orders expelling

and safeguard the territorial integrity of iran iran s supreme national security council snsc said a meeting of the heads of the six nation gulf cooperation council voiced full support on wednesday for the united arab emirates uae in its dispute with iran over the gulf islands of abu musa greater tumb and lesser tumb the move has triggered strong iranian criticism and warnings besides the uae the gcc also groups bahrain kuwait oman qatar and saudi arabia iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani who chaired the snsc s meeting on saturday said during his friday prayer sermon at tehran university iran is surely stronger than the likes of you to reach these islands one has to cross a sea of blood the snsc quoted by the official iranian news agency irna received in cyprus also criticised the gcc and described its support of the uae as irresponsible no country will ever be able to covet even an inch of iranian soil said the snsc earlier on saturday the english language tehran times believed to be close to the foreign ministry said the uae should be aware that iran s self restraint had certain limits it dismissed a uae claim to the islands as unfounded and said a agreement to share abu musa with the uae emirate of sharjah still applied the idea of abu dhabi officials that tehran would always refrain from responding to the blows inflicted by them was childish tehran times said irna said the newspaper was commenting on the gcc statement which urged iran to reverse what it says is the annexation of abu musa island and to pull out of the two other islands iran says the islands near the entrance to the gulf have historically belonged to it the dispute flared this year after iran tightened its control over abu musa reuter af jch rtw tehran paper wants iran revive claim to bahrain tehran dec reuter radical iranian newspapers angered by gulf arab claims to three disputed islands are hitting back with demands that tehran revive its claim to bahrain and consider improving ties with iraq president akbar hashemi rafsanjani and senior officials strongly condemned a statement last week by leaders of the gulf cooperation council gcc backing the united arab emirates uae in its dispute with iran over the gulf islands but the newspapers salam and jomhuri eslami demanded that tehran go further than restating its resolve to defend its sovereignty over the islands of abu musa greater tumb and lesser tumb it is not very clear why the sheikh of bahrain has joined the others jomhuri eslami said the gcc groups bahrain kuwait oman qatar saudi arabia and the uae if historical records are to be the criterion the sheikh of bahrain should go about his own business and the rule of iranian people in bahrain which belonged to iran until should be re established the paper said it is fitting for the foreign ministry to raise the question of iran s sovereignty over bahrain and start a serious and effective drive to end the separation of bahrain from iran it added the late shah of iran relinquished iran s claim to bahrain in a year before the island became an independent state iranian leaders since the islamic revolution have carefully avoided raising the bahrain issue although it is occasionally brought up in the press during periods of tension with conservative arab states across the gulf salam newspaper said the gcc stand showed that the policy of appeasing pro western gulf arab rulers had backfired no matter how much you smile at sheikhs on the southern coast of the persian gulf it is the united states and the west which speak the last word it said they the sheikhs are nobody salam said adding that iran should revise its policy towards its neighbours especially its former war enemy iraq disregarding the logical potential of expanding ties with iraq and going along with some saudi backed trends among the iraqi opposition have played a role in the formation of the current situation the paper said ties between iran and iraq which fought a war from to improved briefly after iraq invaded kuwait in but tehran which denounced the invasion and remained neutral in the ensuing war again called for president saddam hussein s overthrow when he suppressed a shi ite moslem revolt which swept southern iraq after his defeat in kuwait reuter sij mz aet

the fraud of elias davidsson elias davidsson writes ed the following are quotations from zionist leaders they appear in ed numerous scholarly works dealing with the palestine question i urge those ed who have access to original sources to verify the authenticity of the ed source and post here their finding adhering to the truth whatever it be it is your responsibility for posting quotes in context your phony research center is the source of the most unscholarly out of context agenda ridden and sophmoric propaganda that i have ever seen don t believe me folks let s take a little stroll through a few of elias davidsson s contributions to our understanding of the middle east ed quotations from zionist leaders ed there was no such thing as palestinians ed golda meir prime minister of israel london sunday ed times june and what do suggest that she meant by this do you think she meant that the palestinians don t exist or does it actually mean that the people who self identify as palestinians did not appear to be a distinct ethnic group in the eyes of golda meir ed there is however a difficulty from which the zionist ed dares not avert his eyes though he rarely likes to face it ed palestine proper has already its inhabitants ed israel zangwill the voice of jerusalem london ed p when this was written seventy three years ago the people of the region were not all jews they are not all jews now no jew but the most rabid bigot has ever called for an israel to be only for jews that was true then it is true now ed the palestinians are beasts walking on two legs ed menachem begin prime minister of israel in a speech to ed the knesset ed quoted in amnon kapeliouk begin and the beasts new ed statesman june since you inserted the words the palestinians are we cannot know what begin was talking about for someone who wants to embellish his own importance with an absurd pseudo organizational name like the center for policy research you are not a very honest person ed both the process of expropriation of the palestinians ed and the removal of the poor must be carried out ed discreetly and circumspectly ed dr theodor herzl the complete diaries herzl press ed i p herzl died eighty nine years ago are you suggesting that he has stated what is israel s policy today have you ever seen israel even entertain a policy to exclude non jews let alone actually try to remove non jews from israel if you actually believe that this quote has anything to do with israel s non jewish citizenry today you are an idiot but if you realize that israel has no intention of removing non jewish israelis then you are nothing but a common liar this one time i will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you are stupid ed we shall try to spirit the penniless population the ed palestinians across the border by procuring employment ed for it in the transit countries while denying it any ed employment in our own country ed theodor herzl the complete diaries herzl press ed i p once again you quote a man gone for almost a century you do so within the context of modern day israel thomas jefferson owned slaves how does this fact define the united states today ed jews must expel arabs and take their place ed david ben gurion quoted in shabtai teveth ben ed gurion and the palestine arabs oxford university press ed p did he say jews or did you add this this was also a statement from ten years before israel became a state it has no bearing on israel ed we must do everything to ensure they the ed palestinian refugees never do return ed david ben gurion in his diary july quoted in ed michael bar zohar ben gurion the armed prophet ed prentice hall p you added the words the palestinian refugees and by doing so you are misleading people into believing that ben gurion who was expressing his hope that people who fled their lands at the encouragement of people such as king abdullah and the mufti of jerusalem was gloating over people abandoning their homes what he was refering to were the arabs with whom jews were at war ed the country was mostly an empty desert with only ed a few islands of arab settlement ed shimon peres minister of defense quoted in david s ed sling the arming of israel weidenfeld and nicholson ed p at the time of the rebirth of israel this was certainly true especially when compared to what israel has accomplished in a few short decades ed all this story about the danger of extermination of ed jews has been blown up to justify the annexation of ed new arab territories ed mordechai bentov israeli cabinet minister al ed hamishmar april since israel has not annexed even one millimeter of territory in more twenty six years this quote is irrelevant ed neither jewish ethics nor jewish tradition can ed disqualify terrorism as a means of combat ed yitzhak shamir hehazit summer journal of the ed lehi the stern gang translated from the israeli daily ed al hamishmar december again you are quoting a man who was fighting for what he had been promised from a time as ancient as biblical to the time of the balfour declaration just a few short years back and what was thought of and described as terrorism by jews didn t include slaughtering olympic athletes brutally murdering the innocent attacking school buses and murdering another human being for the sole reason that he or she is an arab ed the domination of jewish agriculture by arab ed workers is a cancer in our body ed a uzan israeli minister of agriculture ha aretz ed december there were serious concerns about a work force that consisted of people from outside israel it is a wise to be concerned a work force consisting of foreigners is not a good situation for a country ed there can be only one national home in palestine ed and that a jewish one and no equality in the partnership ed between jews and arabs ed montague david eder president of the zionist ed federation of great britain ed in doreen ingrams comp palestine papers ed seeds of conflict george braziller p this also has no meaning for a country formed seventeen years after this statement was made obviously times change this is not what israel is about today i believe the peace talks make this quote irrelevant ed there is not a single jewish village in this country ed that has not been built on the site of an arab village ed moshe dayan ha aretz april this is completely false ed some people talk of expelling to ed arabs in the event of a new war and instruments have ed been prepared ed aharon yariv former chief of israeli military ed intelligence inquiry december expelled from where israel the occupied territories new jersey is there any way we can read this and get an idea as to what on earth he was talking about obviously not ed we should there in palestine form a portion of the ed rampart of europe against asia an outpost of civilization ed as opposed to barbarism ed dr theodor herzl the jewish state london p ed interesting notion considering that this was written nearly a century ago it is quite visionary ed i deeply believe in launching preventive war ed against the arab states without further hesitation by ed doing so we will achieve two targets firstly the ed annihilation of arab power and secondly the expansion ed of our territory ed menachem begin in a speech to the knesset october ed this was said nearly forty years ago begin is dead and it should be obvious to anybody that if israel was expansionist it would have annexed the occupied territories right after it captured them israel would not be negotiating to get rid of them ed during the last years our people have been in a ed process of building up the country and the nation of ed expansion of getting additional jews and additional ed settlements in order to expand the borders here let no ed jew say that the process has ended let no jew say that ed we are near the end of the road ed moshe dayan ma ariv july he s dead too and since israel has not annexed any land at all since you are once again wasting bandwidth with all of these misleading quotes they are so out of sync with the reality of israel that you do nothing but make yourself look like a fanatic desperate to sway people by misleading them ed let us not today fling accusations at the palestinian ed arab murderers who are we that we should argue ed against their hatred for eight years now they

collier books macmillan new york p interesting quote it s true that we should never lose sight of the plight of these people we should also recognize that this quote preceded the disgusting wave of arab terrorism and violence directed at innocent people that began in with the massacre of the israeli athletes in munich and continues to this day if your ability to obscure was the equal of your

bosnian war taking a strategic turn bosnians call europe s bluff clarinews clarinet com j t nguyen writes united nations upi the muslim dominated government in bosnia herzegovina asked the u n security council tuesday to withdraw all u n personnel from bosnian territory as a first step toward lifting the international arms embargo against the former yugoslav republic the bosnian government saying the presence of u n personnel had become an impediment to critical decisions by the international community indicated the withdrawal of the peacekeepers and relief workers would persuade western governments to lift the arms embargo so muslims could defend themselves against bosnian serbs the security council imposed the arms embargo on the whole of the former yugoslavia in when fighting erupted between serb the imposed it knowing that serbia has a stockpile of weapons and that bosnia will have next to nothing to defend itself many experts predicted a massacre as early as march but the security coucil knew what it was doing france and britain have opposed u s proposals for military air strikes against bosnian serbs saying such strong action would lead to retaliation against their troops and personnel the bosnian move tuesday was in part a bid to undermine the british and french opposition to military intervention based on fears for the safety of european peacekeeping troops and humanitarian personnel silajdzic s ambassador to the united nations mohamed sacirbey who conveyed the letter to the security council members told reporters that the peacekeepers mandate should be modified or they should withdraw he said if the security council refuses to accede to the request his government will take another step he did not elaborate on what other steps the government might take in his letter to the council silajdzic said president clinton understood well the muslims commitment and desperate plight because the united states has been seeking support for lifting of the arms embargo silajdzic said the international community has not realized that the war in bosnia herzegovina was a war of fascist aggression and the maintenance of the arms embargo was an act of arrogant indifference to the fate of hundreds of thousands of loyal bosnian citizens who plead only for the right to defend themselves we beseech the security council to cease an arms embargo that has in practice constituted an international intervention against our legitimate rights as a member of the united nations silajdzic said now read this tim clock co the request to the security council took some members by surprise even though the complaints have been aired by the bosnian government for some time the only allies the muslims could find in the council are non aligned and islamic countries which have been calling for the muslims right to self defense a provision enshrined in the u n charter

factor in the turkish evacuation of persia and motivated the ittihadist young turk leaders to annihilate the turkish armenians the question of responsibility for the massacres or deportation of nearly all ottoman armenians has evolved into a polemic hundreds of books articles and documents have been published to describe the horrifying scenes of violence and death many writers such as the british bryce and toynbee french pinon german lepsius american morganthau and gibbons have insisted that the massacres were predetermined and ruthlessly executed the have refuted the ottoman government s official publications and justifications by substantiating that anti armenian measures were deliberated by the ittihadists even before the outbreak of war the fact remains than an estimated eight hundred thousand to over a million armenians perished within a few months and several hundred thousand more succumbed in the following years to the ravages of disease famine and refugee life unknown

re europe vs muslim bosnians my recollection of history documentary books is slitely different it is my understanding that croats were allies of germany during wwii while serbs had sided with russia as a result serbs did take a beating from croats not bosnian moslems while germany had the upper hand even today russians consider call serbs as their slovac brothers this is one of the issues involved in the u n s lack of active intervention against serbs as for the bosnian moslems i have not heard of any alliance with germany or russia in recent history therefore i am curious if they did or were able to treat other parties in this conflict with same brutallity as they are getting it today in the past history regards ramin moshiri

the enemy within the enemy within by robert i friedman the village voice may vol xxxviii no how the anti defamation league turned the notion of human rights on its head spying on progress ives and funneling information to law enforcement roy bullock wanted to be a spy since he was a teenager in indiana and read i led three lives herbert philbrick s cold war saga of penetrating the communist party for the fbi philbrick had become an american folk hero in the s for building dossiers on unsuspecting colleagues it was a time when hollywood produced more than films portraying the informer as the quintessential american patriot in boston where philbrick led three lives as an fbi informant communist party member and private citizen the mayor even proclaimed a herbert philbrick day and presented the spy with a plaque for bullock a shy young man who was coming to terms with his homosexuality in the straight arrow s the life of a double agent was the perfect way to hide his lifestyle while fighting the communist menace i was fascinated with herbert philbrick bullock recently told federal investigators and so i thought i would try to infiltrate the communist part in i went to the sixth world youth and student festival in moscow with the american delegation i gave them the fbi a full report on it when i returned along with some photos i took of some soviet military vehicles bullock was hooked for the next two years he worked as an unpaid informant for the fbi but he found his true calling when he became a paid spy for the anti defamation league in now his activities are at the center of the biggest domestic spy scandal in recent american history a scandal that may end with the adl s criminal indictment in san francisco over a year period he compiled computer files for the adl on individuals and more than groups of all political stripes including the naacp the rainbow coalition aclu the american indian movement the center for investigative reporting pacifica act up palestinian and arab groups sandinista solidarity groups americans for peace now and anti apartheid organizations bullock who even spied on the recently slain south african nationalist chris hani when he visited the bay area in april sold many of his adl files on anti apartheid activists to south african intelligence meanwhile between and the adl paid him nearly using a prominent beverly hills attorney as a conduit in order to conceal its financial relationship with bullock last month police raided adl offices in los angeles and san francisco as well as bullock s home confiscating computer files and boxes of documents according to court records bullock s files contained the driver s license and vehicle registration information in addition to criminal histories on individuals much of which was allegedly stolen from the fbi and police computers bullock told the fbi that copies of virtually everything in his computer data base had been given to the san francisco adl office based on the evidence says inspector ron roth in a police affidavit i believe that roy bullock and adl had numerous peace officers supplying them with confidential criminal and dmv information what s more the san francisco d a is investigating bullock for tapping phones accessing answering machines and assuming false identities to infiltrate organizations documents seized from bullock s home also contained evidence of his forays into bay area trash cans he had the names and phone numbers of employees at the christic institute in san francisco as well as telephone message slips to staff members including names and phone numbers of callers office correspondence listing the names and return addresses of the senders and inter office memos he also had receipts from christic institute s bank accounts at wells fargo and eureka federal savings as well as itemized canceled checks with the names of the payees the dates and amounts bullock even knew the balance in the christic institute s checking account investigations by the fbi and police in san francisco have revealed that the adl has shared at least some of its spy gathering material with israeli government officials what s more israel apparently used tips from the adl to detain palestinian americans who travelled there the adl was established in new york city in to defend jews and later other minority groups from discrimination it led the fight against racist and fascist groups like the ku klux klan and the american nazi party and in the s championed the civil rights movement but there was also a darker side in the late s the adl spied on leftists and communists and shared investigative files with the house committee on un american activities and the fbi the adl swung sharply to the right during the reagan administration becoming a bastion of neoconservatism to irwin suall a repentant trotskyite who heads the adl s powerful fact finding department the real danger to jews is posed not by the right but by a coalition of leftists blacks and arabs who in his view threaten the fabric of democracy in america as well as the state of israel in the tradition of his ideological soulmate william casey suall directed the adl s vast network of informants who were given code names like scumbag ironside and for a spy reportedly posing as a priest in atlanta flipper for years journalists and liberal members of the jewish community knew the adl spied on right wing hate groups as long as the targets were anti semitic organizations like the liberty lobby and lyndon larouche no one seemed to be particularly troubled but the bullock case reveals that the adl also spied on groups that have a nonviolent and progressive orientation this apparent massive violation of civil liberties may end with the adl s criminal indictment in san francisco where the investigation began the human rights group faces possible criminal prosecution on as many as felony counts including an indictment for gaining illegal access to police computers says one source close to the west coast investigation it is per cent certain that the adl will be indicted in the wake of the san francisco investigation police probes of adl spying are spreading to other parts of the country we have received numerous complaints about adl spying says sam adams a spokesperson for the mayor s office in portland oregon on april the harlem based black united fund of new york and african american self help group that bullock allegedly spied on wrote district attorney robert morgenthau requesting an immediate investigation of the adl the adl s actions cause great concern as it is a direct and flagrant violation at minimum of our civil rights we call upon you to join with the district attorney of san francisco to bring and end to this latest form of mccarthyism gerald mckelvey a spokesperson for morgenthau s office says we have no evidence before us that warrants any sort of investigation mckelvey adds that morgenthau offered to assist the fbi and the san francisco d a s office on their pending investigation they have not so far asked for our assistance the adl acknowledges sharing information on violence prone groups with law enforcement officials it also admits to maintaining extensive files on a wide variety of organizations but says in a two page press release the vast majority of adl s files are composed of news clips magazine articles books journals and other documents adl has made it clear that it does not and will not countenance violations of the law on the part of anyone connected with the agency and the process by which the league gathers information is presently under review to insure that no laws are being violated that s what the adl says for public consumption but morale is so low that its employees complain of sleepless nights and crying fits and even as other jewish groups circle the wagons around the adl in a show of solidarity many do so holding their noses more than a few jewish officials privately say the adl has to decide whether it is a human rights group or a secret police agency the adl is regarded both inside the jewish community and outside the jewish community as the definitive source of information on anti semitism and extremist groups says daniel levitas the former executive director of the center for democratic renewal an atlanta based group that monitors anti semitism racism and hate groups one of the things this scandal has done is that it has completely tainted the adl s credibility and reputation with regard to its objectivity this scandal is going to be a devastating blow to the jewish community at large because people regard the adl as synonymous with american jewry bullock s talents as a snoop and his extreme conservatism meshed well with the adl s cold war worldview in he moved to southern california where he became an adl spy for a week bullock almost always used his real name when snooping although he once called himself elmer fink when corresponding with supporters of alabama governor george wallace bullock provided the adl s office in los angeles with written reports which were transmitted to fact finding department head irwin suall according to court records under suall s stewardship fact finding department had become the adl s heart and soul located at adl national headquarters across from the united nations the department had assembled a vast library on hate groups culling material from publications speeches and informants reports bullock was more than adept at leading a double life not long after moving to california he ingratiated himself with a woman in the john birch society who helped him gain access to the group s boston office there he found a file the right wingers were keeping on the adl the discovery gave rise to speculation in the adl new york office that they had somehow been penetrated by the birchers bullock focused almost exclusively on right wing extremist groups until the early s when adl l a head milton sinn was replaced by harvey schechter who encouraged him to target the left as well a few years later bullock moved to the castro district in san francisco where he posed as an art dealer and adl fact finder who had infiltrated the local arab community had just been exposed when the ensuing scandal died down bullock was ordered by the adl to penetrate the arabs the adl was especially concerned about the american arab anti discrimination committee founded by the former south dakota senator james abourezk to combat arab bashing in a page out of the cia s dirty tricks handbook on penetration and destabilization bullock joined the adc and then recruited nazis into the group apparently trying to discredit it according to published reports in the adl sent bullock to attend the national association of arab americans annual congress in washington according to court documents bullock was told to find the source of the group s funds bullock was unable to follow the money but he did such a good job at ingratiating himself that he was appointed to head a naaa delegation that visited congress member nancy pelosi it s not surprising that the adl penetrated arab organizations but only acute paranoia explains their interest in groups like act up as far as bullock was concerned gay groups in san francisco were heavily infiltrated by what he called gay left revolutionaries prompting him to write about their activities for the adl bullock soon expanded his horizons moving into the shadowy realm of foreign espionage after richard hirschhaut the head of adl s san francisco office introduced him to thomas gerard in gerard was then a detective with the san francisco police department s intelligence unit gerard had worked as a demolitions expert for the cia in el salvador in the early s where he apparently had more than a passing interest in right wing death squads police searching gerard s briefcase found extensive cia literature about torture and interrogation photos of blindfolded and chained men as well as passports made out to gerard in different names including thomas clouseau from a remote jungle island redoubt in the philippines where he fled last november gerard told the los angeles times that he will blow the lid off the cia s involvement with latin american death squads if he is indicted in the adl spy case after their very first encounter in the adl office gerard and bullock had lunch at mcdonald s i liked tom right off bullock later told a san francisco police investigator whose report of the interrogation was obtained by the voice tom is a very charming roguish character with a great deal of integrity let me say here i consider tom gerard one of the finest policemen i ve ever worked with absolutely honest capable intelligent and percent american before long bullock was providing gerard with confidential adl reports on various groups and individuals in turn gerard gave bullock classified police intelligence files on local arab americans skinheads and others bullock told the fbi that gerard s material ended up in his adl reports i would say percent of the data that i got was name address and sometimes physical description criminal history very rarely bullock told investigators gerard also gave bullock a chart that outlined a vast network of bay area arab american businessmen and organizations that allegedly has ties to middle east terror groups as well as surveillance photos of arab americans receiving weapons training overseas bullock claims that u s customs in new york gave gerard the photos it was understood that bullock would be very careful with what he did with the information gerard gave him and that bullock would not release it except to the adl or other law enforcement officers says an fbi report there was nothing unusual about bullock s cozy relationship with law enforcement by the mid s the adl was swapping files with hundreds of official friends the organization s euphemism for u s law enforcement and intelligence sources the adl s relationship with the fbi s counterterrorism office was so close that adl s reports on arab american group s covert ties to middle east terrorists were must reading it s no accident that police found a classified fbi report entitled popular front for the liberation of palestine pflp new york area while searching the adl s san francisco office in adl spooks investigated seven palestinians and a kenyan studying in california universities on student visas when the adl discovered they were disseminating pflp literature it informed the fbi which in turn took the case to the immigration and naturalization service after the ins ordered the students deported as subversives adl regional director david lehrer gloated in the los angeles times about his office s cooperation with law enforcement although he s backpedaling now the los angeles deportation is still under appeal while the adl worked quietly with america s top cops it enjoyed similar ties with israel s spy agencies a charge that adl leaders vehemently deny but as early as july adl director benjamin epstein wrote to b nai b rith executive secretary saul joftes requesting for his investigators our information he boasted to joftes in addition to being essential for our own operations has been of great value and service to both the united states department and the israeli government all data have been made available to both countries with full knowledge to each that we are the source in the adl came under fbi scrutiny in the wake of the pollard spy scandal while assigned to the navy s anti terrorist alert center where he had access to the most closely guarded u s secrets jonathan pollard stole thousands of pages of classified documents for israel which according to federal prosecutors could fill a room the size of a large closet ten feet by six feet by six feet pollard s handler was avi sella an israeli air force colonel whose wife worked for the new york adl as a lawyer pollard later wrote to friends that a prominent adl leader was deeply involved in the israeli spy operation while there is no proof that anyone connected with the adl was involved with pollard there is evidence that the adl freely passes information to israeli intelligence in march the fbi interrogated david gurvitz an adl fact finder in los angeles until when he was fired by suall for illegally obtaining police information to use against a rival at the simon wiesenthal center the fbi pointedly asked gurvitz if he had ever transmitted information to israel gurvitz admitted that in he had learned from a law enforcement contact that michael elias allegedly a member of a radical plo faction was scheduled to travel from san francisco international airport en route to haifa gurvitz phoned the deputy israeli consul general in l a with the information later the same day according to a page fbi interview of gurvitz obtained by the voice gurvitz was called back by another man who said he was from the israeli consulate and who asked gurvitz to repeat the information about elias gurvitz did not get this man s name but their conversation was in hebrew so gurvitz felt confident the man was actually an israeli consulate official among the names of private citizens that police found in adl files in san francisco was mohammed jarad a year old chicago resident who was arrested in israel on january for allegedly distributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to hamas the large islamic fundamentalist movement in the occupied territories the chicago adl office runs at least three undercover informants who work with official friends in local law enforcement according to documents released by the san francisco d a and sources close to the adl given these facts arab american groups surmise that the adl has passed information on jarad to israeli intelligence one technique used by the adl to monitor the large arab american community in the midwest was to scan the local arab press for funeral notices according to sources familiar with the practice adl investigators in unmarked vans videotaped the palestinian funerals which sometimes turned into plo rallies palestinians have been detained at ben gurion airport simply on the basis of having been filmed attending a funeral in chicago according to suhail miari the executive director of the united holy land fund whose cousin was an arab member of israel s knesset shortly after jarad was arrested the israeli government announced that hamas was being run from america with money and operational instructions relayed by courier or fax israel s charges were played up on the front page of the new york times according to well placed sources yehudit barsky an adl fact finder in new york worked closely with israeli officials on this campaign of vilification introducing friendly reporters to official friends in chicago law enforcement barsky who is fluent in arabic prepared an adl report about how hamas is funded in america she identified the dallas based islamic association for palestine in north america as the front organization for hamas in the u s a its infrastructure functions as an interlocking network of organizations small businesses and individual activists says the february adl report which outlines the organization s development its activities on u s college campuses and its metamorphosis during the gulf war it also traces hamas fundraising through a plethora of alleged front groups from plainfield indiana to culver city california it is doubtful that barsky could have compiled such sophisticated data without the help of official friends and adl spies barsky refused to comment but she used to talk to greg slabodkin as many as three times a week when he was an opposition researcher for aipac whose spy operation was disclosed last summer in the voice the level of cooperation was very close slabodkin said during a recent phone conservation from israel where he is in graduate school if we felt our files were lacking we contacted the adl when sha wan jabarin a year old palestinian human rights worker in the occupied territories won a reebok human rights award in slabodkin recalls that barsky faxed aipac the man s entire police file which she had obtained from the israeli embassy jabarin had been arrested numerous times in israel and once confessed to being a member of the plo after having been severely tortured jabarin who received a short jail term became an amnesty international prisoner of conscience of course to aipac and the adl jabarin was a terrorist slabodkin who was ordered to keep tabs on him when he was in the u s to receive his award called a representative of al haq the palestinian human rights group that employed jabarin to obtain his itinerary aipac even opened a file on musician jackson browne who presented jabarin with the reebok award while the adl may be able to rationalize its close monitoring of arabs and even left wing gay revolutionaries it has a far harder time explaining its obsession with spying on anti apartheid activists david gurvitz told the fbi that when he started working as a fact finder for the adl in l a in march adl files already bulged with information about the israel south african connection and anti apartheid groups gurvitz confirmed that the adl did routinely collect information on persons engaged in anti apartheid activities in the united states says the fbi report while gurvitz said there were files in the l a adl office dating to the s he estimated the oldest material on anti apartheid activities dates back to the late s paralleling begin s rise to power in israel and a deepening of ties between the jewish state and south africa in about august says the report of the fbi s march interview with gurvitz an anti apartheid demonstration was held at the south african consulate in los angeles participating in the demonstration were the los angeles student coalition and the socialist workers party gurvitz went to two demonstration planning sessions and a subsequent demonstration he wrote a report for the adl on each of the planning sessions and on the demonstration copies of the reports were disseminated to bullock among others in care of the san francisco adl office in bullock learned that the consul general of the south african consulate in los angeles would be speaking in las vegas at a meeting organized by willis carto the head of the anti semitic liberty lobby suspecting that the consul general did not know who willis carto is says the fbi report bullock suggested to gerard that they might want to warn the south africans gerard agreed and informed the consul general who canceled his appearance a few months later gerard phoned bullock and told him a south african intelligence officer wanted to meet them during a rendezvous in a hotel near fisherman s wharf the south african said he was interested in acquiring information on american anti apartheid activists the south african who called himself mr humphries also asked for information about groups that were advocating divestments gerard who was present throughout the meeting says the fbi report told humphries that he gerard had been employed by the cia humphries offered to pay bullock per month in exchange for information bullock noted that much of the information humphries said he wanted was already in the possession of bullock and the adl between and bullock sold information to south african intelligence receiving steady raises which he split evenly with gerard bullock said it was his impression though gerard never explicitly told him so and bullock never asked that gerard may have been telling the cia about his and bullock s contacts with the south africans says the fbi report gerard had said he knew the cia resident agent in san francisco once after gerard dropped bullock off at bullock s residence following a meeting with louie who replaced humphries as their handler gerard said he was going to go to the san francisco cia office al the while gerard may have been tasking bullock for the cia bullock recalled that once after he had met gerard bullock went to chicago illinois to conduct an investigation on behalf of the adl says the fbi report the target of the investigation was a group called the palestine human rights campaign bullock learned that a woman name deleted was transporting money between the plo or the pflp and the united states bullock told this to gerard gerard later told bullock that gerard s guy at the cia would like to know more gerard asked bullock if bullock would go back to chicago to gather more information on the palestine human rights campaign bullock however never did go back gerard also seems to have had a close relationship with mossad which may have started in when he went on an adl junket to israel the adl frequently sponsors trips for american law enforcement officials to israel where they are wined and dined and meet their counterparts in various intelligence agencies according to an affidavit by san francisco police inspector roth the all expense paid trip to israel was more or less a thank you gift and a liaison gesture by the adl to continue the close relationships it has with specific law enforcement officers from the united states gerard may have liked what he saw in israel a short time after travelling there he went to addis ababa where he helped with mossad s rescue of ethiopian jews as gerard s relationship with south africa deepened he talked more openly about his exploits in the cia bullock recalled gerard mentioning that he had been in algeria on cia business and that gerard discussed the plo and safehouses says the fbi report to this louie once responded that israeli intelligence had determined that the plo and the african national congress were cooperating gerard also spoke of having travelled with the cia to afghanistan louie also told gerard and bullock about his adventures inside south africa as an intelligence officer both gerard and louie traded war stories and regaled each other and bullock with tales of narrow scrapes although there is still much mystery about what triggered law enforcement s investigation of the adl it was probably the theft of a classified fbi report on the nation of islam from the fbi s san francisco office police armed with search warrants recovered the report in the adl san francisco office gurvitz says he had sent a copy of it to mira boland the director of the adl s fact finding division in washington d c boland was preparing an op ed piece for the washington times in which she argued that the nation of islam should not receive federal funds for the reconstruction of l a because the group is anti semitic and violence prone boland who had arranged the adl police junket to israel attended by gerard testified in a criminal trial in roanoke virginia that she had worked for the cia for months and later was a subcontractor for the defense department before joining the adl during the trial boland admitted to sharing information with a cia official at an invitation only adl conference after he was questioned by the fbi last fall gerard fled to the philippines which has no extradition treaty with america gerard is believed to have supplied information from police computers not only to the adl but to israel and south africa as well the san francisco examiner reported that gerard may be charged with violating federal espionage laws although bullock worked for the adl for years and irwin suall praised him in a july memo as our number one investigator the adl now argues that he was a rogue agent in its own defense the adl also asserts that its fact finders operate no differently than journalists after all ask adl officials don t journalists keep files but the difference between the practice of journalism and the adl s method of gathering information couldn t be more striking journalists place information in the public domain where they are held accountable for falsehoods distortions and libel and for the most part journalists don t share their investigative files with foreign and domestic police agencies the adl has no such inhibition because many of its files are not open to public scrutiny false information collected by ideologically biased researchers cannot be corrected once a proud human rights group the adl has become the jewish thought police the adl says it s a human rights group not just for jews but for everyone says chip berlet a highly respected researcher at the massachusetts based political research associates which monitors right wing extremist groups that s fine but it can t do that and spy on palestinians it s blatantly unethical and frankly immoral my argument to people is that the adl wears four hats each of the hats independently is appropriate it is a broad based human rights group that looks at the broad issues of prejudice and discrimination it is a group that defends jews against defamation entirely noble nothing wrong with that hat it is a group whose leaders at least consistently defend the actions of israel against its critics which again is entirely appropriate and it is a group that maintains an information sharing arrangement with law enforcement again there is nothing wrong for a group to do that but you can t do all four it is impossible to do all four and not violate the bounds of ethics there s a built in conflict of interest if you wear all four hats adl national director abraham foxman apparently sees no such conflict in a september letter to the voice foxman complained adl has a proud year record of fighting bigotry and promoting civil rights and constitutional freedoms any imputation of an effort or motive on our part to smear or stifle the free speech of anyone is false and baseless throughout his pieces on aipac s spying friedman describes the dissemination of information as if it were slander and the existence of files as a token of mccarthyite inclination the depiction is misleading in several ways virtually every journalist academic politician and organization keeps files on subjects they deem relevant tracing the logic of friedman s reckless charges the library of congress is tantamount to the kgb moreover disseminating the public record of a public figure is neither defamation nor mccarthyism but many believe the adl is increasingly in the defamation business ask jesse jackson james abourezk or the leaders of the new jewish agenda all past targets of adl smears at the same time the adl exonerated the fascist world anti communist league which assisted ronald reagan s covert war against nicaragua a policy endorsed by adl leaders in the early s researchers russ bellant and berlet asked to meet fact finding head irwin suall to discuss their work on anti semite lyndon larouche our view then of irwin suall was that he was this really terrific investigator says berlet so we introduce ourselves say what we are up to and suall leans back in his chair and basically runs down a dossier on each of us about what our political activities are who we work with what organizations we belong to obviously he was just trying to blow us away and he succeeds admirably we were just sitting there with our mouths open feeling very uncomfortable and then he leans forward and says the right wing isn t the problem the left wing is the problem the soviet union is the biggest problem in the world for jews it s the american left that is the biggest threat to american jews you re on the wrong track you re part of the problem we were stunned i was virtually in tears this is not how i perceived myself we basically stumbled out of there in a daze letters response to friedman s article the village voice may vol xxxviii no a league of his own robert i friedman s assault on the anti defamation league the anti defamation league is spying on you may demonstrates that he has an axe to grind and his own prejudiced and biased agenda to promote it also demonstrates that concern for accurate reporting is far down on his list the story is replete with inaccuracies innuendos and outright falsehoods and conveys a picture of adl so divorced from reality as to be farcical friedman is even wrong on such basic easily determined facts as where adl was founded chicago not new york and the building in which adl s san francisco office is located not the jewish community federation building pictured adl has done the work of fighting haters for years without spying on organizations or individuals and with profound respect for the law our mission is to monitor and expose those who are anti jewish racist anti democratic and violence prone and we monitor them primarily by reading publications and attending public meetings through the years we have published scores of reports on anti semitism emanating from both the left and the right in fact although friedman s bias leads him to assume the contrary adl s primary concern is still the far right because extremist organizations are highly secretive sometimes adl can learn of their activities only by using undercover sources friedman s hyperbole notwithstanding these sources function in a manner directly analogous to investigative journalists some have performed great service to the american people for example by uncovering the existence of right wing extremist paramilitary training camps with no recognition and at considerable personal risk the information adl obtains is placed in the public domain and through the years adl has established a reputation for accurate reporting friedman s article by contrast contains so much misinformation that it would take an article equally as long to set the record straight a few examples he states that an adl leader was deeply involved in the jonathan pollard israeli spy operation and that pollard s handler s wife worked for the new york adl as a lawyer not true friedman also states adl investigators in unmarked vans videotaped palestinian funerals not true elsewhere he asserts that adl was obsessed with spying on anti apartheid activists again not true we could go on and on and of course friedman does not reveal his sources the distortion games friedman plays when he mentions numbers further reveal his lack of objectivity when it comes to how much adl paid roy bullock a week as an independent contractor not an employee an important distinction friedman also fails to make he includes the zeros inviting the reader to see a large number by contrast when he observes that adl paid bullock nearly between and he chooses not to point out that amounts to little more than a year hardly an excessive sum what is accurate about friedman s story is chip berlet s description of adl s four hats yes adl looks at broad issues of prejudice and discrimination yes adl defends israel against critics and yes adl maintains an information sharing relationship with law enforcement regarding extremist activities and hate crimes we see no conflict in these four activities and we believe most voice readers won t either abraham foxman national director anti defamation league manhattan robert i friedman replies for the adl to compare itself to investigative journalists is absurd journalists don t spy on arabs and anti apartheid activists and then freely pass their files to south african and israeli intelligence but according to police the confessions of two paid adl investigators buttressed by pages of court documents and interviews the adl does indeed the adl spies on groups that are neither anti semitic nor violent police confiscated adl files on hundreds of mainstream groups ranging from act up to peace now respected intellectuals and middle east scholars who disagree with the adl s political views have ended up on adl blacklists their reputations smeared private organizations have no business paying operatives inside police departments or having spies says an april editorial in the st louis post dispatch condemning adl spying on april police armed with search warrants raided adl offices in san francisco and l a after concluding that adl employees were apparently less than truthful in voluntarily turning over documents during an earlier search according to san francisco police inspector ron roth s sworn affidavit roth also asserts that bullock was a paid employee for the adl if so by failing to pay taxes on of income paid to bullock the adl could face a total of felony counts according to court papers the adl may also face felony charges for illegally obtaining confidential information from police computers as for errors the adl was founded in chicago and moved to new york in but it was an original tenant in the san francisco building shown in the voice photo moving out a few months ago i never wrote that an adl leader was deeply involved in the pollard israeli spy operation i reported that pollard himself made the charge and in court papers pollard s own lawyer said that the wife of pollard s handler worked for the adl if i have a bias it is on the side of the first and fourth amendments

jewish community and just as jewish capital from europe was beginning to have an effect in istanbul local armenians and greeks started a pogrom against jews immediately across the sea of marmara at haydarpasa terminus of the anatolia railroad with three hundred jews massacred and many more beaten and raped before the disturbance was stopped after the sultan sent his personal guard across the bay to protect the jews in later years ritual murder attacks against jews carried out mostly by native greeks armenians and in arab provinces by maronites and other arab christians often with the assistance of the local european consuls took place throughout the empire there were literally thousands of incidents continuously until world war i in southeastern europe as far west and north as monastir and kavalla in istanbul at gallipoli and the dardanelles at salonica and in all the arab provinces as far south as damascus and beirut and in egypt at cairo and alexandria these invariably resulted from accusations spread among ottoman christians by word of mouth or published in their newspapers often by christian financiers and merchants anxious to get their jewish competitors out of the way or to divert onto the jews muslim anger at reports of christian massacres of muslims in southeastern europe or central asia resulting in individual and mob attacks on jews and the burning of their shops and homes individual experiences were horrible jews constantly went in fear of armenian or greek attacks in the streets of ottoman cities in egypt and syria it was usually the greeks who led the way in many cases with the assistance of local armenians and syrian christians whose greek arabic and french language newspapers often printed all the rumors they could find regarding jews evidently with the desire of instigating violence the syrian arab christians in particular spread their long standing anti semitic hatreds from syria to egypt where their monopoly of the local press and their espousal of popular causes such as egyptian nationalism and opposition to the british rule enabled them to spread their anti jewish message among the muslim masses with little question or opposition on june thus sir evelyn baring later lord cromer british high commissioner in egypt received the following report from david and nissim ades in cairo sir i beg sir to draw to your attention to the violent articles which has sic appeared in an arabic paper called el mahroussa which contained nothing but lies and false accusations against the jews especially those the issues of the th th and th instant now sir are we to have here an anti semitic party amidst fanaticism greeks armenians etc or is he to be allowed to continue to poison the people s minds with exaggeration and painted words in an article he asserted that the jews use christian blood for passover of course this has caused a deal of excitement whenever greek and other orthodox religious authorities or prominent greek business leaders or consuls were asked to help to stem the violence or reduce tension they invariably indicated their cooperation and then failed to do anything to prevent attacks or punish those who stimulated or led them the leader of the ashkenazi community of corlu complained to the president of aiu alliance israelite universelle in about persistent greek attacks against its jewish quarter the

re israel an apartheid state not quite in article srg cinnj early bird think com shaig think com shai guday writes in article spam maths adelaide edu au jaskew spam maths adelaide edu au joseph askew writes please cite specific examples where an arab party member was rejected while a jewish party member was accepted if you look at the bottom of this article you will see that i have very kindly dug up one of yigal arens previous postings entirely without his permission i hope he doesn t mind containing translations from ha arezt detailing just such a case perhaps you think that ha arezt lies would you like to provide me with an assurance that this practise never occurs if you examine these i am sure you will discover that the arab party member did not have the power base that his jewish counterpart had right arabs have been voting in israel for how long and in all that time not one arab ever gained enough of a personal following to get his fellow party members to put in a ministry this is about as likely as sprouting wings and flying to rio what basis do you have for explaining this odd failure you seem very confident that you are right exactly how do you know why are you sure once again if for arguments sake all the arab israelis were to vote for labor at the next election you can rest assured that the number of arab mks and cabinet members would increase proportionately to the power shift exactly what basis do you have for saying this when the labour party has never put an arab into a cabinet post and insists its coalition members do the same why and on what basis are you reassuring me in the face of years of discriminatory practise you are overlooking the fact that they wield political power as individuals based upon a wider collective power base hey what as i said even when their party puts them up they get knocked back it surely couldn t be because they are arabs is it the reasoning i see at work is purely political as far as security goes i think that some serious gaffs were made by right wing jews as well e g sharon well yes but security is the reason most often given by people who want to make excuses i merely thought it would crop up and so pre empted it start of article all commets in are mine not dr arens comments in square brackets are mine yigal from the other front july translation of ha aretz article racism in the knesset coalition requirements on one hand and the presence of progressive mks from meretz in the coalition on the other have compelled rabin and his friends to change to some extent their attitude towards the arab public and their representatives in the knesset although he did refuse to view them as partners taking part in the coalition and joining the government he did agree to meet with them and to give them a document of intentions which included a commitment to work towards a decrease in the discrimination between jewish and arab citizens decrease what but posters have told us time and again that such discrimination does not exist at all is rabin too a closet self hater yigal however racism has not disappeared when the knesset sat to consider who would staff its various committees a request was made to put an mk from hadash the communist party one of the arab parties yigal on the state comptroller s committee and oh did that ever stir up a storm including in the ranks of labor since many knesset members find it unthinkable that an arab mk sit on one of the important house committees security secrets are liable to fall into their hands this attitude which until recently had not even aroused criticism being so natural and so deeply embossed upon people s hearts holds that there are knesset members who despite having been elected by tens of thousands of votes are not entitled to be full partners in the body which represents the people of israel we are not speaking here of political discrimination which would be bad enough in itself but of racial discrimination the proof one of the compromises proposed was that mk mahamid an arab yigal should be replaced by tamar gojanski a jew yigal from the same party it was not the member s party which was considered unfit but his race here is a documented case in a respected israeli newspaper it is worth noting that for the first time since the state s founding a public debate has arisen on this subject as witness the following article a test of self confidence by gid on levi ha aretz july revelations of discrimination against arabs have become such an integral part of our daily routine that there is not much effort made to deal with them do you hear that please contact this levi fellow and explain to him how little he knows about israel please yigal except that sometimes the demon bursts out from behind the government s window dressing and then the phenomenon is seven times more serious last week provided two more such examples the israeli knesset is finding it very difficult to allow arab representation on its more important committees and israel television is finding it no less difficult to give a platform to arabs from the territories seemingly two entirely different matters but in fact they are one and the same the th knesset proved last week that even though one third of its members are new faces it has not renewed its own face at all at least on one issue parliamentary traditions may be modernized and parliamentary traditions may become obsolete and only one tradition endures forever no arab shall set foot in the more important committees of the house there has never been and never will be an arab mk on the external affairs and defense committee or on the finance committee worlds have been overturned over the question of whether or not to give arabs for the first time a place on the state comptroller s committee the arguments are old and well known in all three of the above committees innumerable secrets are revealed and woe unto us if an arab should hear them one must not make light of such arguments but their significance should also not be exaggerated every arab mk is not spending all his time waiting for the opportune moment to hand over information from the knesset committee room to black panther headquarters in jenin and not all the aforementioned committees are continually occupied in the discussion of top secret matters which could safely be revealed for example to mks supportive of the jewish underground but not to an arab mk from the likud labor or even from hadash the arabs themselves would probably forego membership in the subcommittee on secret service matters but what would happen one may ask if mk nawaf masalha were to hear god forbid a review of the foreign minister in an open meeting of the foreign affairs and defense committee or even a review of the army chief of staff which in any case are regularly leaked to the next edition of the news and what would happen if mk hashem mahamid were to report on what he had seen with his own eyes at al najah their non participation in important committees and that of their colleagues creates an intolerable situation where arab members of the elected house have only semi positions they are good enough for addressing plenary sessions and for voting for or against the government and participating in the deliberations of the immigration and absorption committee but they must not for example participate in the process of formulating the state budget in the finance committee or in the allocation of resources to local authorities in any case they have little part in that labor s dependence on the support of the arab parties has brought about some improvement mk hashem mahamid will it seems participate in the state comptroller s committee earlier there had been a ridiculous attempt made to dictate to hadash who their representative should be and thus to prevent the arab from entering this dubious holy of holies but it soon became clear that there was no legal or constitutional backing for such a step but not to worry even now the jewish mind is contriving devices the new committee chair roni milo has already announced that he will set up subcommittees aplenty for his committee thus he will decide where it is permissible for mahamid to participate and where not a solution such as this could by the way also have been adopted for the rest of the committees thereby completely eliminating

re israel an apartheid state not quite in article spam maths adelaide edu au jaskew spam maths adelaide edu au joseph askew writes in article srg cinnj early bird think com shaig think com shai guday writes in article spam maths adelaide edu au jaskew spam maths adelaide edu au joseph askew writes if you examine these i am sure you will discover that the arab party member did not have the power base that his jewish counterpart had right arabs have been voting in israel for how long and in all that time not one arab ever gained enough of a personal following to get his fellow party members to put in a ministry this is about as likely as sprouting wings and flying to rio what basis do you have for explaining this odd failure you seem very confident that you are right exactly how do you know why are you sure it has nothing to do with how long they have been voting as much as how they have been voting pick up a list of the labor parties proposals for mk prior to the election and pay attention to the order correlate this with the number of arab party members eligible to vote in party elections further correlate this with the voting results from arab areas lo and behold you will discover that israeli arab labor party members did not band together unanimously or en large for a select group of arab candidates this problem is further exacerbated by the rifts between israeli arabs some claim membership to right wing parties while others vote for parties that do not pass the minimum cutoff i worked within the labor party during the late s elections not this last one as a volunteer and was privy to the voting results that were returned from the local delegates elected at the time the system was structured differently but it did not cease to amaze me that there was no massive effort to lobby for arab reps by their own delegates exactly what basis do you have for saying this when the labour party has never put an arab into a cabinet post and insists its coalition members do the same why and on what basis are you reassuring me in the face of years of discriminatory practise quite simply if all eligible arab voters became members of the labor party and voted they would be able to command more than of the delegates this is a power base that can not be ignored especially when they are not ranked high in the party once again due to lack of political power i have seen how the labor party works from the inside and my experience has been that as in most political situations the mks act out of their own self interest and to answer your question i broke with labor because i felt that they were heeding too much to the right wing and ultra orthodox coalition members from the other front july translation of ha aretz article racism in the knesset this attitude which until recently had not even aroused criticism being so natural and so deeply embossed upon people s hearts holds that there are knesset members who despite having been elected by tens of thousands of votes are not entitled to be full partners in the body which represents the people of israel we are not speaking here of political discrimination which would be bad enough in itself but of racial discrimination the proof one of the compromises proposed was that mk mahamid an arab yigal should be replaced by tamar gojanski a jew yigal from the same party it was not the member s party which was considered unfit but his race fair enough my take on the matter and i will admit to the possibility that this might be seen differently is that this was a dummy argument if he was sitting on the committee then someone else obviously would not be in drumming up support for his seat mk would not be averse to using this argument or it could be used on his behalf as to the proof presented in this article i would find it very interesting to know who proposed the compromise along with a followup describing how the matter stands was resolved let me just take this opportunity to say that i deplore such actions and groundless justifications a test of self confidence by gid on levi ha aretz july but not to worry even now the jewish mind is contriving devices the new committee chair roni milo has already announced that he will set up subcommittees aplenty for his committee thus he will decide where it is permissible for mahamid to participate and where not a solution such as this could by the way also have been adopted for the rest of the committees thereby completely eliminating the fear of state secrets being leaked to the enemy and removing the stain of discrimination from the knesset for the record roni milo is a brash mk self described from the likud note not labor quite frankly i don t think anything he would say could surprise me annoy and aggravate yes surprise no do you accept that as documentation yes i do and thank you for providing it i would be most interested in knowing how things turned out anyone shai guday stealth bombers os

according to greek government there are no turks in western thrace in article may news uiowa edu mau herky cs uiowa edu mau napoleon writes there are treaties signed between greece and turkey which speak about a moslem minority in thraki and not of a turkish minority in thraki the reason they talk about moslems and not about turks is that the majority of these people are not ethnik turks they are pomaks and gypsies oboy this is exciting first you discuss your non existent literature tastes then your fantasies and now your choices of historical revisionism are you related to arromdians of the asala sdpa arf terrorism and revisionism triangle the agreement on the exchange of minorities uses the term turks which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference to muslims the fact that the greek governments also mention the existence of a few thousand non turkish muslims does not change the essential reality that there lives in western thrace a much bigger turkish minority the pomaks are also a muslim people whom all the three nations bulgarians turks and greeks consider as part of themselves do you know how the muslim turkish minority was organized according to the agreements it also proves that the turkish people are trapped in greece and the greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world the greek authorities deny even the existence of a turkish minority they pursue the same denial in connection with the macedonians of greece talk about oppression in addition in the democratic greek parliament passed law no virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and other charitable trusts they have ceased to be self supporting religious and cultural entities talk about fascism the greek governments are attempting to appoint the muftus irrespective of the will of the turkish minority as state official although the orthodox church has full authority in similar matters in greece the muslim turkish minority will have no say in electing its religious leaders talk about democracy the government of greece has recently destroyed an islamic convention in komotini such destruction which reflects an attitude against the muslim turkish cultural heritage is a violation of the lausanne convention as well as the so called greek constitution which is supposed to guarantee the protection of historical monuments the government of greece on the other hand is building new churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward hellenizing the region the longstanding use of the adjective turkish in titles and on signboards is prohibited the greek courts have ordered the closure of the turkish teachers association the komotini turkish youth association and the ksanti turkish association on grounds that there are no turks in western thrace such community associations had been active until but they were first told to remove the word turkish on their buildings and on their official papers and then eventually close down this is also the final verdict november of the greek high court helsinki watch a well known human rights group had been investigating the plight of the turkish minority in greece in august their findings were published in a report titled destroying ethnic identity turks of greece the report confirmed gross violations of the human rights of the turkish minority by the greek authorities it says for instance the greek government recently destroyed an islamic convent in komotini such destruction which reflects an attitude against the muslim turkish cultural heritage is a violation of the lausanne convention helsinki watch problems of turks in western thrace continue ankara a a in a page report of the helsinki watch it is stated that the turkish minority in western thrace is still faced with problems and stipulated that the discriminatory policy being implemented by the greek government be brought to an end the report on western thrace emphasized that the greek government should grant social and political rights to all the members of minorities that are equal to those enjoyed by greek citizens and in addition they must recognize the existence of the turkish minority in western thrace and grant them the right to identify themselves as turks newspot may greece isolates west thrace turks the xanthi independent mp ahmet faikoglu said that the greek state is trying to cut all contacts and relations of the turkish minority with turkey pointing out that while the greek minority living in istanbul is called greek by ethnic definition only the religion of the minority in western thrace is considered in an interview with the greek newspaper ethnos he said i am a greek citizen of turkish origin the individuals of the minority living in western trace are also turkish emphasizing the education problem for the turkish minority in western thrace faikoglu said that according to an agreement signed in greece must distribute textbooks printed in turkey in turkish minority schools in western thrace recalling his activities and those of komotini independent mp dr sadik ahmet to defend the rights of the turkish minority faikoglu said in fact we helped greece because we prevented greece the cradle of democracy from losing face before european countries by forcing the greek government to recognize our legal rights on turco greek relations he pointed out that both countries are predestined to live in peace for geographical and historical reasons and said that turkey and greece must resist the foreign powers who are trying to create a rift between them by cooperating adding that in turkey he observed that there was will to improve relations with greece newspot january macedonian human rights activists to face trial in greece two ethnic macedonian human rights activists will face trial in athens for alleged crimes against the greek state according to a court summons no obtained by mils hristos sideropoulos and tashko bulev or anastasios bulis have been charged under greek criminal law for making comments in an athenian magazine sideropoulos and bulev gave an interview to the greek weekly magazine ena on march and said that they as macedonians were denied basic human rights in greece and would field an ethnic macedonian candidate for the up coming greek general election bulev said in the interview i am not greek i am macedonian sideropoulos said in the article that greece should recognise macedonia the allegations regarding territorial aspirations against greece are tales we are in a panic to secure the border at a time when the borders and barriers within the eec are falling the main charge against the two according to the court summons was that they have spread intentionally false information which might create unrest and fear among the citizens and might affect the public security or harm the international interests of the country greece the greek state does not recognise the existence of a macedonian ethnicity there are believed to be between to ethnic macedonians living within greece largely concentrated in the north it is a crime against the greek state if anyone declares themselves macedonian in greece serbia yugoslavia and bulgaria partioned macedonia into three pieces in albania took macedonian villages the part under serbo yugoslav occupation broke away in as the independent republic of macedonia there are million macedonians in the republic in bulgaria in albania and in serbia proper sideropoulos has been a long time campaigner for macedonian human rights in greece and lost his job as a

home town of florina lerin in northern greece aegean macedonia where the majority of ethnic macedonians live balkan watchers see the sideropoulos affair as a show trial in which greece is desperate to clamp down on internal dissent especially when it comes to the issue of recognition for its northern neighbour the republic of macedonia last year the state department of the united states condemned

the armenians did not form a distinct race in article c t xj unix amherst edu eerginel unix amherst edu erdem erginel writes my question is given so many separations in the armenian community what was the common denominator of the armenian people that allowed armenian nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century as i stated religion there are various contradictory views on the origin of the armenians the name is to be found in the darian inscriptions in the form armina or aramaniya is to be found in the inscription on the bistun monument the following references to the armenians are to be found in the bistun cuneiform inscription of dara vishdasb b c the monarch dara said i sent my servant to arminam armeniya on reaching arminam armeniya to the country town of zozo to armaniya armeniya according to karakashian as for armenia the equivalent of the armin or arminik of the persians this is more recent than the word ararat and is to be found used in the dara inscriptions for haiastan saint martin the name armenie has been given since very early times by almost all the various eastern peoples to the territory referred to by the armenians as haiastan it was known to the syrians as armenia and to the arabs as ermeniyye others believe that urartu was known in the time of the medes as harminap which was later modified by the persians to arminia ar refers to a place as in ararat archish aruyr archar arshav arazen and aror while men is used to refer to spirit thought or human being and therefore armen would appear to signify the people of that place g alishan believes that according to our national vocabulary haik is the diminutive form of hai and that hai is the name of our nation our nation is in no way connected with the word armen that foreigners apply to our people it would thus appear that armenia is a place name that armen is the name of the people who lived there and that these are in no way connected with the word hai haik and haiastan armenian historians believe haik to have been a great hero from whom the armenian people took the name hai but the mere resemblance between the words haik and hai constitutes no real proof and in any case no such theory appears before the time of moses of khoren haiasa the following studies show quite clearly that hai and haiasa were no more than general names used by the hittites to refer to the region known as armenia professor hachadurian haiasa was the general name used in hittite inscriptions for upper armenia yensen in his hittites and armenians tries to prove that hai is identical with the hittite hatio in other words that hai is a hittite word research however has proved this erroneous and shown that hai was derived from hatio mortman s attempt to read the urartu inscriptions as armenian met with no success as for greek there is no point in even mentioning it the resemblance between the words haiasa and haiastan is so obvious that we may well accept haiasa as the oldest form of haiastan let us now cast a brief glance on how the words hai haikazan and haiastan entered our older works according to karakashian the word haik is never to be found employed with reference to a leader of the armenian people prior to moses of khoren nor is it ever found employed in the forms haika or haykazn agahangelos and puzant use the word as a title or a place name he improved and developed haiastan etc if the word had referred to a nation and had been derived from hai or haik they could also have used the words haikak and haykazn in a number of places according to professor sayce who deciphered a number of hittite inscriptions in the hittite language the suffix ha is used to specify quality or species the words haddanas haddina were used by the assyrians to refer to the hittites with the transformation of the d between the two a letters to y hadinasdani was in this way transformed to haiastan professor grechmer fully agrees with this point of view but regards the significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms hai and haistan as quite unsatisfactory he finds however that a solution to this problem is brought nearer by the name haiasa which is so frequently found in bogazkoy from b c onwards forrer takes haiasa as referring to upper armenia in that case it seems likely that haiasa was actually a part of armenia the suffix dan is of anatolian origin the real root is hayasa which refers to the country of the hayasas e chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological and anthropological characteristics of the armenian people the armenians in russia may be characterized as follows almost all of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic very dark above average height an aissores asian group with close ties with certain kurdish tribes and azerbaijan peoples according to j deniker from the philological point of view the armenian and kurds may be regarded as belonging to the iranian group the armenians are descended from various elements and from a very mixed race their average height varies between and according to the region they are almost always short headed with skull measurements of as a race they belong to the indo afghan assyrian turkic family professor rene vernont writes as follows the armenians are a mixture of semites turk kurds and mongols but some of them display armenian features e g height a little above average fair complexion dark hair dark eyes very often a hooked nose and a rather wide mouth investigations carried out by n kossovitch on the links between armenian blood groups and their

armenians brought havoc to their neighbors a short sighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda and anachronistic methods the armenians continue to become pernicious for the region as usual they will be treated accordingly by their neighbors nagorno karabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely within azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to x soviet armenia besides the geographical aspect nagorno karabag is the historic homeland and the cradle of the artistic and literary heritage of azerbaijan which renders the armenian claims preposterous even lunatic no one in his or her mind could have imagined that one day such a devious turn of event could have plagued the azeris one cannot even imagine the reverse case to occur for the armenians either would have slaughtered the azerbaijanis or put them to forced exile to maintain their own majority where was she an appeal to mankind during the last three years azerbaijan and its multinational population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of the soviet union all humanitarian constitutional human rights guaranteed by the un charter universal declaration of human rights helsinki agreements human problems international forums documents signed by the soviet union all of them are violated the ussr s president government bodies do not defend azerbaijan though they are

and the united states one of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent events stem from the territorial claims of armenia on azerbaijan it is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between armenians and azerbaijanis on the issue of karabakh hundreds and thousands armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in azerbaijan land had their representatives in all government bodies of the azerbaijan ssr we are for a united indivisible sovereign azerbaijan we are for a common caucasian home proclaimed in by one of the founding fathers of the azerbaijan democratic republic muhammed emin rasulzade but all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the soviet leadership in favour of the armenian expansionists encouraged by moscow and intended to create a new year reich the great armenia by annexing the neighboring lands the world public opinion shed tears to save the whales suffers for penguins dying out in the antarctic continent but what about the lives of seven million human beings if these people are muslims does it mean that they are less valuable can people be discriminated by their colour of skin or religion by their residence or other attributes all people are brothers and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding this is not the first appeal of azerbaijan to the world public opinion our previous appeals were unheard however we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the

azerbaijan about men women and children dead in the worst outrage of the four year war over nagorny karabakh the figure is drawn from azeri investigators hojali officials and casualty lists published in the baku press diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates the february attack on hojali by armenian forces was one of the last moves in their four year campaign to take full control of nagorny karabakh the subject of a new round of negotiations in rome on monday the bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and a massacre but investigators say that most of the dead were civilians the awful number of people killed was first suppressed by the fearful former communist government in baku later it was blurred by armenian denials and grief stricken azerbaijan s wild and contradictory allegations of up to dead the state prosecuter aydin rasulov the cheif investigator of a man team looking into what azerbaijan calls the hojali disaster said his figure of people dead was a minimum on preliminary findings a similar estimate was given by elman memmedov the mayor of hojali an even higher one was printed in the baku newspaper ordu in may dead people named and more than bodies reported unidentified this figure of nearly dead is quoted as official by leila yunusova the new spokeswoman of the azeri ministry of defence francois zen ruffinen head of delegation of the international red cross in baku said the muslim imam of the nearby city of agdam had reported a figure of bodies received at his mosque from hojali most of them civilians we did not count the bodies but the figure seems reasonable it is no fantasy mr zen ruffinen said we have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead mr rasulov endeavours to give an unemotional estimate of the number of dead in the massacre don t get worked up it will take several months to get a final figure the year old lawyer said at his small office mr rasulov knows about these things it took him two years to reach a firm conclusion that people were killed and wounded when soviet troops and tanks crushed a nationalist uprising in baku in january those nationalists the popular front finally came to power three weeks ago and are applying pressure to find out exactly what happened when hojali an azeri town which lies about miles from the border with armenia fell to the armenians officially people have so far been certified as dead being the number of people that could be medically examined by the republic s forensic department this is just a small percentage of the dead said rafiq youssifov the republic s chief forensic scientist they were the only bodies brought to us remember the chaos and the fact that we are muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within hours of these people were women and were children under years old gunshots killed people shrapnel killed and axes or blunt instruments killed exposure in the highland snows killed the last three thirty three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation including ears noses breasts or penises cut off and eyes gouged out according to professor youssifov s report those bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed mr rasulov said files from mr rasulov s investigative commission are still disorganised lists of azeri militiamen are dead here six policemen there and in handwriting of a mosque attendant the names of corpses brought to be washed in just one day the most heartbreaking account from witnesses interviewed so far comes from towfiq manafov an azeri investigator who took a helicopter flight over the escape route from hojali on february there were too many bodies of dead and wounded on the ground to count properly in hojali people by the stream and the road and visible around nakhchivanik village mr manafov wrote in a statement countersigned by the helicopter pilot people waved up to us for help we saw three dead children and one two year old alive by one dead woman the live one was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up we tried to land but armenians started a barrage against our helicopter and we had to return there has been no consolidation of the lists and figures in circulation because of the political upheavals of the last few months and the fact that nobody knows exactly who was in hojali at the time many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by armenian forces the independent london heroes who fought on amid the bodies aref sadikov sat quietly in the shade of a cafe bar

rabin and his palestinians kapos from center for policy research cpr subject rabin and his palestinians kapos rabin s plans for a palestinian police from the other front alternative information center jerusalem may the decision to view the setting up of a local police force for sic the palestinians as the central issue for deliberation at the peace talks to be resumed next week even before subjects like elections in the territories and areas of juridiction in the framework of autonomy is a sign of the israeli government s serious attitude towards the peace process the setting up of a police force is not part of the gesture package but deals with the very heart and substance of the palestinian struggle for national identity as it turns out the main objective guiding the prime minister in the setting up of a palestinian police force and apparently also supported by foreign minister shimon peres is to ensure the holding of democratic elections in the territories thus writes amnon barzilai in his editorial israeli daily hadashot april and his position articulates the thinking of most of the commentators who dealt with this issue in the past two weeks over against them stand the settlers and rightwing parties who also interpret the decision to encourage the establishment of a palestinian police force as a significant step towards the instituting of real autonomy something which will restrict what can be done by the jewish settlers in the west bank and gaza strip with a variety of demonstrations including street theater on what will happen when there is a palestinian police force rightwing elements are attempting to frighten the israeli public and to pressure rabin to go back on his decision members of the kach movement have even begun to organize a settler police force in the occupied territories as counter balance to the future palestinian police force however as barzilai points out the main function of the new police force as far as the israeli government is concerned has nothing to do with the settlers over whom they will apparently have no authority but will control political groups within the palestinian population whom the government is interested in neutralizing writes barzilai according to ideas currently taking shape the setting up of a local police force in the territories will precede not only the stage of electsion but also the final stages of the preparing of the interim autonomy agreement the willingness of the israeli government to set up a local palestinian police force is evidence that the government is serious about arriving at a settlement with the palestinians it s no wonder that the palestinian public is also greatly worried about this new israeli initiative and it is inevitable that pressure will be brought to bear on faisal husseini and the rest of the delegation members from a variety of directions to refuse the gift which rabin would like to give them but at this stage it looks like the palestinians are cooperating in the fulfillment of his plans add l comment by e d numerous palestinians fear that israel might succeed in co opting some palestinian circles by this idea they fear that a palestinian police force controlled in fact by israel might act even more brutally than the idf the idea of using a surrogate police force is not new it is used by israel in lebanon and was used by the nazis to control jewish ghetto dwellers
reflections on bosnia owen neier reflections on bosnia lord owen and the serbs in early february lord owen made appearances in new york city on the donahue and charlie rose shows on a couple of occasions on those shows lord owen gave away his pro serbian position when he made the point that much or most of the bosnian territory then in dispute or already overrun by serbian forces had been controlled and occupied by serbs before wwii it was as if he were saying that since the serbs had previously occupied those territories and lost them during the hitler years they should be allowed to reconquer them today i was familiar with this view because my father a yugoslav jew who escaped to this country during the war was aided and found sympathy among the serbs during those harrowing years in recent months when the subject of serbian aggression was mentioned my father would make the point that serbs were killed by nazi and pro nazi croatian forces known as the ustasha my father is so pro serbian that he dismissed reports of serbian atrocities my father also excoriated new york times columnist anthony lewis because my father said anthony lewis is always talking about the muslims update april after an uneasy truce in and around sbernica shelling has resumed in nearby areas by all sides and the killing and the misery continues apace while the clinton administration dithers its response in the days leading to the collapse of resistance at sbernica lord owen changed his tune previously he had opposed military intervention on the grounds that it would endanger u n relief workers when serbian forces began to march on sbernica the threat to u n relief soldiers went unmentioned while lord owen called for outside intervention to stop serbian aggression including the use of air strikes the current disastrous situation can be seen as a failure of the west and a failure of the vance owen initiative which did nothing to halt the serbs now that it s too late to save muslim areas that lord owen felt should be in a muslim state lord owen belatedly calls for strong action clinton and bosnia in the summer of george kenney a senior state department official the undersecretary in charge of the yugoslav desk made news when he resigned from the state department because of the bush administration s refusal to take any action to halt serbian aggression as kenney saw it bush s inaction was largely due to the president s unwillingness to risk any political capital by getting involved there apparently the same is true of the clinton administration clinton gives the impression that he cares more than bush did about the terrible ongoing tragedy but the practical effect has so far been the same according to the new york times the clinton administration did everything it could to suppress a mid march report by its own experts which called for military action if necessary to protect safe havens for the muslims at one point senate majority leader george mitchell was so incensed that the report was kept from congress that he called for an investigation instead of helping the desperate bosnians clinton has signalled again and again that milosevic and the serbs are free to do what they want in bosnia indeed clinton and the west have been signalling that the serbs should get on with the job and finish off the bosnians as quickly as possible while we turn the other way a key signal was when clinton made it clear that he would not send in american military forces on the ground on this issue clinton has made me wistful for bush bush and baker could not have done worse and might have been pressured to do better well before this time lives in bosnia might have been saved and the destruction might have been curtailed the nation the left and the bosnian quandary typical of the left s inability to come to grips with the core issue involved in bosnia i e a clear aggressor destroying hundreds of thousands of lives is the editorial on the bosnian quandary in the nation in the end the editorial votes to do nothing even while noticing the ghastly atrocities of the bosnian serbs and that the greater and lesser powers dither and fuss and hang back before anything else happens the clinton administration ought to pay the million the united states owes the u n the editorial concludes in its most striking passage the editorial writer warns that those who are pushing president clinton to intervene on the side of the bosnians had better review u s foreign policy since world war ii the editorial argues for inaction on the basis that the bosnian serbs are no worse than any number of u s clients including the chileans the south africans the greek fascists and others in a subsequent column for the nation christopher hitchens correctly called this editorial contemptible william pfaff a european based journalist who writes for the the new yorker and the los angeles times is among a group of liberal columnists like anthony lewis and leslie gelb who have clearly and consistently called for strong western and american intervention to stop the serbs pfaff s most recent column liberal opinion week is entitled international cowardice worsened bosnian tragedy he clarifies the international failure which has led to present situation in one sentence having refused to intervene to sanction the threat to minority rights in newly independent croatia in june or to block or penalize the military aggression by serbia that immediately followed and the atrocious ethnic cleansing which followed that the united nations now contemplates deploying in bosnia military force on a scale which two years ago could have deterred the horrors yugoslavia has since experienced he goes on to explain that u n plans now envisaged call for a more daunting and open ended military assignment than a direct military intervention to halt the aggression would have been a year ago aryeh neier on the serbs in his watching rights column in the the nation aryeh neier gets to the heart of the motivation of the aggressors the preferred term for the serbian forces who have been besieging and shelling sarajevo for more than a year he explains that there is no military purpose that is served by the destruction of its fabric and its people above all few of those aligned with the forces attacking sarajevo would want to live there even if the city could be rebuilt they are not city people it is this i believe aside from a desire to break the morale of bosnians and make them press their government to accept peace at any price that explains the conduct of the siege of sarajevo i t is a loathing for all that is urban pluralist and cosmopolitan that has made sarajevo the object for devastation historically most of the serbian population in bosnia and herzegovina has been rural while muslims who were the civil servants and intelligentsia during the centuries of ottoman rule made up a disproportionate share of the urban population the destruction of sarajevo is not only an expression of hostility against this city it is also an attack on the urban idea the demagogues who whipped up the passions let loose by this war exploited not only ethnic and religious bigotry but also hatred for all that is cosmopolitan the light that neier sheds on the issue helps to clarify what is at stake the serbs represent the know nothing anti secularist fundamentalist fascist forces who are attacking the urban cosmopolitan secular multi cultural idea they are attacking the rest of us just as hitler did one irony is that at the beginning of the crisis over bosnia it was for awhile maintained by the serbs and their supporters that they were responding to a threat by the bosnian muslims to create a fundamentalist state neier has shown that it is the serbs who are the great threat to secularism multi culturalism diversity and democracy it s the serbs who are attacking the democratic notion the democratic idea anthony lewis comes close to the point when he asks why does respect for clinton s presidency depend on his acting effectively against serbian aggression first of all because to do nothing about genocide would be such a betrayal of the values we and our allies profess times but it s not merely a betrayal of our values it s because the serbs are attacking us by proxy just as hitler was one argument for decisive action by the west that is heard in a different form is that war in the balkans is destablizing for europe we hear it as the bosnians are europe s palestinians that is to say just as the palestinian refugee problem has been the key to instability in the middle east just so will the hundreds of thousands of yugoslav refugees of all ethnicities result in turmoil in europe for decades to come one of the lessons of the twentieth century is that even though the atlantic ocean divides us the americas are ultimately tied to the destiny of europe if europe is destabilized the u s will inevitably be affected and drawn into its problems as in a whirlpool sooner or later we will be drawn into the maelstrom and as past history and pfaff have shown it s much better if we do so decisively quickly and on our terms sincerely ronald bleier

government in the east in soviet armenia today there no longer exists a single turkish soul it is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us create for ourselves it certainly is possible to severe the artificial life support system of an imagined ethnic purity that some of us falsely trust as the only structure that can support their heart beats in this alien land sahak melkonian preserving the armenian purity if you are going to lie and invent quotes at least use the right date you sound like asala sdpa arf idiots clowns crooks if you prefer to imagine that u s ambassador bristol and armenian jewish scholars were trying to mislead arromdians be my guest a typical armenian clown source u s library of congress bristol papers general correspondence container while the dashnaks x soviet armenian government were in power they did everything in the world to keep the pot boiling by attacking kurds turks and tartars by committing outrages against the moslems by massacring the moslems and robbing and destroying their homes during the last two years the armenians in russian caucasus have shown no ability to govern themselves and especially no ability to govern or handle other races under their power source general bronsart wrote as follows in an article in the july issue of the newspaper deutsche allgemeine zeitung since all the moslems capable of bearing arms were in the turkish army it was easy to organize a terrible massacre by the armenians against defenseless people because the armenians were not only attacking the sides and rear of the eastern army paralyzed at the front by the russians but were attacking the moslem folk in the region as well source john dewey the turkish tragedy the new republic volume november pp they armenians boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and fifty thousand men to fight a civil war and that they burned at least a hundred turkish villages and exterminated their population armenia was not a soviet republic in so sorry to burst your little bubble what a clown let us ask armenian scholars shall we source hovannisian richard g armenia on the road to independence university of california press berkeley and los angeles p the addition of the kars and batum oblasts to the empire increased the area of transcaucasia to over square miles the estimated population of the entire region in was of whom percent were armenian percent georgian and percent moslem of the latter group were tatars paradoxically barely one third of transcaucasia s armenians lived in the erevan guberniia where the christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds erevan uezd the administrative center of the province had only armenians as compared to moslems by the time of the russian census of however the armenians had established a scant majority percent in the guberniia it had risen by to percent or of the inhabitants this impressive change in the province s ethnic character notwithstanding there was on the eve of the creation of the armenian republic a solid block of tartars who continued to dominate the southern districts from the outskirts of ereven to the border of persia see also map historic armenia and map administrative subdivisions of transcaucasia in percent turk we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination our troops surrounded village after village little resistance was offered our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets completed the work some of the tartars escaped of course they found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into turkey the rest were killed and so it is that the whole length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the north were dotted with mute mournful ruins of tartar villages they are quiet now those villages except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead ohanus appressian men are like that p as for your other quote i would love to know the source just say so source men are like that by leonard ramsden hartill the bobbs merrill company indianapolis pages memoirs of an armenian officer who participated in the genocide of million muslim people foreword for example we were camped one night in a half ruined tartar mosque the most habitable building of a destroyed village near the border of persia and russian armenia during the course of evening i asked ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and the cause of its destruction in his matter of fact way he replied yes i assisted in its sack and destruction and witnessed the slaying of those whose bones you saw to day scattered among its ruins p first and second paragraphs we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination our troops surrounded village after village little resistance was offered our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets completed the work some of the tartars escaped of course they found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into turkey the rest were killed and so it is that the whole length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the north were dotted with mute mournful ruins of tartar villages they are quiet now those villages except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead p second paragraph the tartars were for the most part poor some of them lived in villages and cultivated small farms many of them continued in the way of life of their nomadic forefathers they drove their flocks and herds from valley to valley from plain to mountain and from mountain to plain following the pasturage as it changed with the seasons they ranged from the salt desert shores of the caspian sea far into the mighty caucasus mountains even the village tartars are a primitive people only semicivilized i can see now that we armenians frankly despised the tartars and while holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country regarded and treated them as inferiors the fact that the russians looked down upon all armenians in much the same way as armenians regarded tartars far from proving a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors intensified an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility p second paragraph our men armed themselves gathered together and advanced on the tartar section of the village there were no lights in the houses and the doors were barred for the tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great fear our men hammered on the doors but got no response whereupon they smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last tartar was slain throughout the hideous night i cowered at home in terror unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and the loud shouts of our men by morning the work was finished p second paragraph as things were the members of the dashnack party were without administrative experience consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself incompetent to rule by legitimate means the members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and outside the law when they became a legally instituted recognized governing body with the destiny of armenia in their hands they proved incompetent to do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their fight against the russian and turkish governments in their outlaw days the outstanding feature of their rule now that they were in power was as in the old days trial and execution without hearing a man evoking the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him the method of execution was for a government mauserist to walk up behind the condemned man in his home or on the street place a pistol to the back of his head and blow out his brains this simple way of getting rid of those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became a common way of paying debts p first paragraph a soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the tartar i saw the point of the weapon emerge through his back another soldier seized a rock and pounded the tartar s head with it the armenian who had bayoneted him sprang to his feet wrested the weapon from the tartar s body and raising it to his lips licked it clean of blood exclaiming in russian slodkey slodkey sweet p second paragraph one evening i passed through what had been a tartar village among the ruins a fire was burning i went to the fire and saw seated about it a group of soldiers among them were two tartar girls mere children the girls were crouched on the ground crying softly with suppressed sobs lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and other furnishings of tartar peasant homes there were also bodies of the dead p first paragraph i was soon asleep in the night i was awakened by the persistent crying of a child i arose and went to investigate a full moon enabled me to make my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy that had been enacted guided by the child s crying i entered the yard of a house which i judged from its appearance must have been the home of a turkish family there in a corner of the yard i found a women dead her throat had been cut lying on her breast was a small child a girl about a year old p slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow the cart jolting and the loads swaying boys ran along the line of oxen encouraging them with shrill tartar cries and belaboring the beasts with sticks in the carts the women veiled as is the tartar way held children in their arms wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they sought protection from the wind and cold a few old men plodded along on foot across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown the leading oxteam reached this barrier and halted the gunmen and other ruffians concealed among the rocks opened fire women and children leaped and scrambled from the carts screamed ran and sought vainly for safety this massacre was not complete the armenian soldiers in the near by barracks hearing the firing and the turmoil hurried to the scene that same day the abandoned tartar quarter of alexandropol was looted and completely destroyed p great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding places on the retreat of the turks followed our army as it advanced they entered into the city with the army and immediately began plundering the stores that had been left by the turks p terrible vengeance was taken upon tartars kurds and turks their villages were destroyed and they themselves were slain or driven out of the country p the fanatical dashnacks hated the turks above all others and then in order of diminishing intensity tartars kurds and russians p first and second paragraphs russian troops did terrible things in the turkish villages we armenians did not spare the tartars if persisted in the slaughtering of prisoners the looting and the rape and massacre of the helpless become commonplace actions expected and accepted as a matter of course i have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground in numbers like the fallen leaves in a forest they had been as helpless and as defenseless as sheep they had not died as soldiers die in the heat of battle fired with ardor and courage with weapons in their hands and exchanging blow for blow they had died as the helpless must with their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself p first paragraph in this movement we took with us three thousand turkish soldiers who had been captured by the russians and left on our hands when the russians abandoned the struggle during our retreat to karaklis two thousand of these poor devils were cruelly put to death i was sickened by the brutality displayed but could not make any effective protest some mercifully were shot many of them were burned to death the method employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut and then after crowding the hut with turks set fire to the straw p first paragraph the tartar section of the town no longer existed except as a pile of ruins it had been destroyed and its inhabitants slaughtered the same fate befell the tartar section of khankandi p second paragraph many of our men had served in the russian army and were trained soldiers we armenians were rich and possessed arms tartars had never received military training they were poor and possessed few arms beyond knives shortly after the killing of the tartars in our village the revolution in russia was suppressed p third paragraph within a few years following the beginning of the movement an invisible government of armenians by armenians had been established in turkish armenia in armed opposition to the turkish government this secret government had its own courts and laws and an army of assassins called mauserists professional killers to enforce its decrees p first paragraph the dashnacks were in continual open rebellion against the turkish government p third paragraph the dashnacks engineered a general revolt of armenians in turkish armenia under the mistaken belief that european nations would intervene and secure independence for turkish armenia p second paragraph the dashnacks were fanatics p third paragraph the dashnacks took advantage of this situation and extended their revolutionary activities into the russian province they instituted a campaign of terrorism and employed threats and force in securing contributions to the party funds from rich armenians a wealthy man would be assessed a stipulated sum refusal to pay brought upon him a sentence of death every member of the party was pledged to carry out orders without question if a man were to be assassinated lots might be drawn to select an executioner or the job might be assigned to one of the mauserists of the party p first paragraph in moments of victory against turks and kurds or tartars they armenians have been remorseless in seeking vengeance p third paragraph the city was a scene of confusion and terror during the early days of the war when the russian troops invaded turkey large numbers of the turkish population abandoned their homes and fled before the russian advance p second paragraph i made a cannon a huge gun to lift which required four men i made balls for it with my cannon the armenians could knock down any of the tartar houses and so they were able to drive the tartars out p first paragraph the tartar villages were in ruins p third paragraph the dead tartar lay with his head in a pool of mud and blood his beard still setaceous and now crimsoned need i go on serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work

an eyewitness account of how a turkish family was butchered by in article galaxy ucr edu raffi watnxt ucr edu raffi r kojian writes another thing i find interesting when turks whine about armenians taking control of their land is that turkey is still occupying n cyrus how can you have the gall to even open your mouths about karabakh until turkish troops are completely out of the independent island of cyprus no wonder you wieneramus are in such a mess following the greek cypriot attempt to annex the island to greece with the aid of the greek army turkiye intervened by using her legal right given by two international agreements turkiye did it for the frequently and conveniently forgotten people of the island turkish cypriots for those turkish cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island since and the next is karabag the people of turkiye know quite well that greece and the greek cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing cyprus and will remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with greece someday whatever the cost to the parties involved the history speaks for itself greece was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on july in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of archibishop makarios the release of nikos sampson a member of eoka national organization of cypriot fighters and a convicted terrorist shows that the enosis mentality continues to survive in greece one should not forget that sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the turks in cyprus committed murder to achieve this goal and tried to destroy the island s independence by annexing it to greece of course the greek governments will have to bear the consequences for this irresponsible conduct the museum of barbarism irfan bey street

dangerous we ran to the bathroom and toilet which we thought would be safer altogether we were nine persons we all hid in the bathroom except my wife who took refuge in the toilet we waited in fear mrs ilhan the wife of major doctor was standing in the bath with her three children murat kutsi and hakan in her arms suddenly with a great noise we heard the front door open greeks had come in and were combing every corner of the house with their machine gun bullets during these moments i heard voices saying in greek you want taksim eh and then bullets started flying in the bathroom mrs ilhan and her three children fell into the bath they were shot at this moment the greeks who broke into the bathroom emptied their guns on us again i heard one of the major s children moan then i fainted when i came to myself or hours later i saw mrs ilhan and her three children lying dead in the bath i and the rest of the neighbours in the bathroom were all seriously wounded but what had happened to my wife then i remembered and immediately ran to the toilet where in the doorway i saw her body she was brutally murdered in the street admist the sound of shots i heard voices crying help help is there no one to save us i became terrified i thought that if the greeks came again and found that i was not dead they would kill me so i ran to the bedroom and hid myself under the double bed an our passed by in the distance i could still hear shots my mouth was dry so i came out from under the bed and drank some water then i put some sweets in my pocket and went back to the bathroom which was exactly as i had left in an hour ago there i offered sweets to mrs ayshe her daughter and mrs novber who were all wounded we waited in the bathroom until o clock in the morning i thought morning would never come we were all wounded and needed to be taken to hospital finally as we could walk mrs novber and i went out into the street hoping to find help and walked as far as koshklu chiftlik there we met some people who took us to hospital where we were operated on when i regained my consciousness i said that there were more wounded in the house and they went and brought mrs ayshe and her daughter

through reports from that remote area by western ar correspondents and from commentaries by member of the long established ar armenian american community azeri views on this dispute have ar appeared rarely if at all in the western news media therefore let me ar present washington report readers with some basic truths about the ar origins of the conflict during the past two years if one reads all the commentaries on the subject a small minority of the writers have been armenia or azeri the following should be interesting ar armenian leaders claim that azerbaijan was the first to oppress and ar expel the armenian minority from the azerbaijani republic actually ar the initiative to banish the azeri minority and convert the armenian ar republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of ar when azeris were driven out of armenia following that move ar there were massacres of armenians in the azerbaijani cities of sumgait ar in february and two years later in baku in january this not true other than simply checking the newspapers i will quote from an independent human rights report in the pax cristi netherlands september page we read by mid november many incidents took place in several places in azerbaijan the apf azeri popular front challenged the communist party for power after ten days the authorities came in with tanks to reimpose their power in nakhitchevan the last armenian villages were deported in ganja armenians were attacked and killed all armenian inhabitants fled the city between november and december refugees from ganja arrived in armenia while all azeris in armenia were chased away in this part of the world february start of organized anti armenian pogroms in azerbaijan come before november and december of ar azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that ar both events were inspired from moscow to secure russian imperial rule ar in the transcaucasus according to the roman principle of divide and ar rule similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five year ar history of the conflict it is interesting that the azeris killed burnt raped the armenians but the perpetrators blame russians and armenians themselves on other occasions ar each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement in ar zheleznovodsk moscow tehran rome geneva and alma ata an ar invisible hand provoked further bloodshed those interested in ar maintaining the azeri armenian conflict as well as the georgian ar turmoil are imperialist forces in russia and probably in iran incorrect when were the people of nagorno karabakh ever involved in an agreement never until azerbaijan sits down with the armenians of nagorno karabakh there will never be an end to this conflict ar the armenian offensive last spring created more than new azeri ar refugees from the captured towns of upper and lower karabakh and ar adjacent rural districts today azeri refugees throng the ar city of baku and environs providing more problems for the newly ar elected popular front government which is opposed by the rigidly ar nationalistic national independence party it s called war if the azerbaijanis didn t try to deport and allow the armenians of nagorno karabakh to live in their ways keep their armenian culture these armenians would not have had to defend their existence the azeris should not have assumed that armenians were going to roll over and play dead ar how can a western style democracy survive in a small muslim country ar where million of the million inhabitants are unemployed in the ar absence of any international effort to help azeri refugees as kurdish ar and bosnian refugees have been helped how can the azeri government ar reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands homes and ar possessions the azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they attempted to deprive armenians of lands homes and possessions ar such simple realities must be understood in the west ar misunderstanding caucasian politics leads both western and russian ar public opinion to imagine a permanent and therefore irreversible ar ethnic and religious rivalry in the caucasus true and you dr alec rasizade should practice what you preach ar i think western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea ar meanwhile continuation of the war could draw both eastern and western ar states into the conflict through activation of various security ar alliances these include on the armenian side the moscow led ar commonwealth forces under the tashkent mutual security pact signed ar may on the azeri side should turkey get involved as the ar guarantor of the nakhichevan autonomy through the kars treaty of oct ar these include the north atlantic treaty forces western interference turkish intervention the moment turkey dares step into this conflict it will close the doors of any chance of turkey being part of europe as if it ever will and will destroy the eastern third of anatolia dr rasizade international realpolitik is not as simple minded as you would have us believe ar upper karabakh generally is described in western press reports as an ar armenian enclave within azerbaijan the truth is that the armenians ar began to appear there only in the middle of the last century incorrect once again a brief scan of history addresses such a foolish claim armenians today refer to the area of nagorno karabakh as artsakh which comes from the urartian term urtekhe urtekhini no azeris yet ancient greeks referred to artsakh as orkhistena no azeris yet in the first half of the th century b c artsakh as part of ervandid armenia of media no azeris yet from the end of the th century b c artsakh was part of the armenian kingdom of ervan no azeris yet artsakh was still part of the armenian empire of tigran orkhistena or artsakh is refereed to by strabo as part of armenia no azeris yet after armenia was divided between the persian and byzantine empires in a d until artsakh was part of armenia no azeris yet end of the th century utik and artsakh became principalities of the aranshakhiks no azeris yet by the th century an artsakh dialect of armenian formed no azeris yet emperor konstantin addressees a letter to the prince of khachen to armenia khachen was the central principality of artsakh no azeris yet in the decree of paul i the number of armenian families in this area was stated as it was from the th to the th centuries that non armenians from central asia asia minor and kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence in the planes of artsakh caucasian muslims around karabakh in karabagh becomes part of russia officiallt part of russia some muslims in karabakh in the number of armenian churches in nagorno karabagh was priests parishioners in armenian towns and villages the armenian percentage of the population was over max azeris in karabakh assuming no kurds consider the following statement by the azerbaijani revcom on december the worker peasant government of azerbaidzan having been informed of the proclamation of armenia a soviet socialist republic sends its greetings to the brother people from this day the previous boundaries between armenia and azerbaidzan are annulled nagornyi karabakh zangezur and nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the armenian socialis republic long live the brotherhood

celebrated the th anniversary of their ar resettlement from persia to karabakh after it came under russian ar rule no incorrect the celebration was the th anniversary of russian rule in the caucasus including karabakh ar at the same time the russian colonial administration also drew ar in russian and german settlers who were welcomed by azeris how ar would americans react if the large numbers of armenians living in ar southern california suddenly claimed an armenian homeland and ar demanded separation from california non sequitur ar armenian historians insist that before the armenian resettlement ar karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal christians that is correct armenian historians don t say this ar the people of medieval caucasian albania adopted christianity in the ar fourth century but those ancient residents had no link to and ar nothing in common with armenians considering the caucasian albans were of the armenian apostolic faith and their utilization of the armenian language in their liturgy makes such an argument totally invalid ar azeris would have a better claim to ar be successors of albania since azeris have for centuries inhabited ar dominated and developed the karabakh part of the azeri nation wishing to be part of a people non existent for nearly a millennium for geo political advantage is rather outrageous in addition to such absurdity azeris claim to

ar both armenia and azerbaijan last year signed the final act of the ar conference on security and cooperation in europe of and the ar paris charter for new europe of confirming their mutual ar adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders this ar principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the ar republic of azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory ar nations not just by turkey such agreements do not give azerbaijan the right to de populate karabakh of armenians ar this is one key to intervention on behalf either of the u n the ar csce

houses come you and look no dammit my stomach isn t one is a turkish officer in uniform him you must see we were under those trees by the mosque in an open space i don t believe you i said but followed to a nail studded door the man pushed it ajar then spurred away leaving me to check on the corpse i thought i should this charge was so constant so gritted my teeth and went inside the place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes and was dark at first for its stone walls had only window slits rags strewed the mud floor around an iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black with soot all looked bare and empty but in an inner room flies buzzed as the door swung shut behind me i saw they came from a man s body lying face up naked but for its grimy turban he was about fifty years old by what was left of his face a rifle butt had bashed an eye the one left slanted as with tartars rather than with turks any uniform once on him was gone so i d no proof which he was and quickly went out gagging at the mess of his slashed genitals p first paragraph how many people lived there oh about eight hundred he yawned did you see any turk officers no sir i was in at dawn all were tartar civilians in mufti the lieutenant dozed off then i but in the small hours a voice woke me dro s he stood in the starlight bawling out an officer anyone keelhauled so long and furiously i d never heard then abruptly dro broke into laughter quick and simple as child s both were a cover for his sense of guilt i thought or hoped for somehow despite my boast of irreligion christian massacring infidels was more horrible than the reverse would have been from daybreak on armenian villagers poured in from miles around the women plundered happily chattering like ravens as they picked over the carcass of djul they hauled out every hovel s chattels the last scrap of food or cloth and staggered away packing pots saddlebags looms even spinning wheels thank you for a lot dro i said to him back in camp but now i must leave we shook hands the captain said a bientot mon camarade and for hours the old molokan scout and i plodded north across parching plains like lot s wife i looked back once to see smoke bathing all doubtless in a sack of other moslem villages up to the line of snow that was iran p at morning tea dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole high region called the karabakh deep in tactics they spoke russian but i got their contempt for allied neutral zones and their distrust of promises made by tribal chiefs a campaign shaped more raids on moslem villages p it will be three hours to take dro told me we d close in on three sides the men on foot will not shoot but use only the bayonets merrimanov said jabbing a rifle in dumbshow that is for morale dro put in we must keep the moslems in terror soldiers or civilians i asked there is no difference said dro all are armed in uniform or not but the women and children will fly with the others as best they may p the ridges circled a wide expanse its floors still hundreds of feet down the fog held solid as cotton flock djul lies under that said dro pointing our men also attack from the other sides then whee ee his whistle lined up all at the rock edge bayonets clicked upon carbines over plunged archo his black haunches rippling then followed the staff the horde nose to tail bellies taking the spur armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war even though i heard our utica brass roar as i watched from the height it took ages for djul to show clear a tsing of machine gun fire took over from the thumping batteries cattle lowed dogs barked invisible while i ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow puddle mist at last folded upward as men shouted at first heard faintly the came a shrill wailing now among the cloud streaks rose darker wisps smoke red glimmered about house walls of stone or wattle into dry weeds on roofs a mosque stood in clump of trees thick and green through crooked alleys on fire horsemen were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot tartarski shouted the gunner by me others pantomimed them in escape over the rocks while one twisted a bronze shell nose loaded and yanked breech cord firing again and again shots wasted i thought when by afternoon i looked in vain for fallen branch or body but these shots and the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women s cries at length all shooting petered out i got on my horse and rode down toward djul it burned still but little flame showed now the way was steep and tough through dense scrub finally on flatter ground i came out suddenly through alders on smoldering houses across trampled wheat my brothers in arms were leading off animals several calves and a lamb p fourth paragraph corpses came next the first a pretty child with straight black hair large eyes she looked about twelve years old she lay in some stubble where meal lay scattered from the sack she d been toting the bayonet had gone through her back i judged for blood around was scant between the breasts one clot too small for a bullet wound crusted her homespun dress the next was a boy of ten or less in rawhide jacket and knee pants he lay face down in the path by several huts one arm reached out to the pewter bowl he d carried now upset upon its dough steel had jabbed just below his neck into the spine there were grownups too i saw as i led the sorrel around djul was empty of the living till i looked up to see beside me dro s german speaking colonel he said all tartars who had not escaped were dead p more stories of armenian murdering turks when the czarist troops fled north my hosts told me of their duty here to keep tabs on brigands turkish troop shifts hidden arms spies christian red or tartar coming in from transcaucasus then they spoke of the hell that would break loose if versailles were to put as threatened the six armenian vilayets of turkey under the control of

re rabin and his palestinians kapos providing safety and security for one s own people is the most fundamental responsibility of any political entity for the palestinian leadership to refuse to accept this responsibility i e take the responsibility to protect their people from radical palestinian elements who are opposed to the peace process is reprehensible to argue that a palestinian police force would be established in order to control peaceful political groups only reinforces the reality that the palestinian leadership so far can not exercise control over radical palestinian elements nor effectively deal with the killing of palestinians by palestinians this is a problem that can only be solved by the palestinian people

re zionist leaders frank statements in article t aqj odv cville srv wam umd edu aap wam umd edu alberto adolfo pinkas writes in article bf fc news service uci edu tclock orion oac uci edu tim clock writes try coming up with your own definition of any or all self hating peoples to me any who reject their culture to the point where they only see the absolute negatives of that culture generally or regarding a particular event and accept only those views purely opposing aspects of that culture thus selective belief in use of historical facts and a complete ignoring of context results hate their culture i believe that things are getting mixed here critizicing israel and or being anti zionist is not seeing the absolute negatives of that culture if that culture referred to is israeli being anti zionist can be seen as a complete denial of that entity s right to exist and its legitimacy just as saying that islam has no right to establish and implement a state that includes any non muslims both are absolute one dimensional views of that culture with regard to the issue of state maybe because a person can see the positives of that culture is that that person opposes zionism and the actions of the state of israel if that were the case one would expect a few of that culture s positives to be discussed with regard to the issue at hand since the issue centers on israeli culture i have yet to hear of any positives of that culture in this discussion i for one consider the actions of the state of israel with respect to the human rights of the palestinian people as an example of an action thaty opposes what jewish culture was suppose to uphold as an example of respect and what the jewish people learned about oppresion segregation and years in the diaspora i agree with you but i also feel that when a culture feels it is confronted by another group that wishes to see that culture disassembled the first culture has little choice but to try to secure its survival as well as maintain its moral center since the culture is not about to turn away from either the matter of its survival or the valuing of its moral principles it has the virtually impossible job of balancing to discuss israel s faults and crimes without any recognition of this circumstance and reality it faces is a conscious decision based on the discussant s political biases not on an honest and empathetically open understanding of the situation the same applies to those who attempt to paint the palestinian movement as all bad and dispense with considerations of the reality facing them that certainly describes elias since he has no intention of recognizing that alongside the palestinian experience and perspective there exists also that of israelis he might not want to recognize that it does not make him a self hating jew as far as i see it at most he is a person who is not telling the truth you beg the question by centering on the symptoms while the issue of self hating addresses the motivations i certainly feel that anyone who expends so much effort inflating distorting and robbing human context from aspects of his her own culture is reflecting a degree of dislike for it since bits of that culture are bound due to his her upbringing to be a part of him her a bit of self dislike seems likely to be mixed in somewhere who is a jew a person whose integrity decays when unmoved by the knowledge of wrong done to other people a j heschel that is why i get moved when i see the israeli army killing people in the occupied territories as much as i get moved when i see a plestinian stabing people in israel and this is precisely why israeli society has been tremendously harmed by the actions it its government has felt it had to take in response to an other perceived as a threat just as with you there has long been a strident and emotional debate about the pain israelis feel when forced to balance desires for survival and moral beliefs the trauma of having to make that choice is made worse by the fact that neither can be conveniently brushed aside as a result of a reasoned political debate for the sake of the other only reshaped but so far it seems that the blame is always put on the other if you read this newsgroup for example israel is never guilty by herself she is always responding to the actions of the other and it goes as if the actions of isreal do not also affect the response of the other in a cycle that never ends also there is blindness to try to understand what the other feels and why as you well know this process of blaming the other for the morally questionable actions one side is forced by the other of course to take is thoroughly practiced by both sides if you are only hearing the pro israeli crowd s self supporting arguments that may be due to the fact that you are not listening for anything else i certainly hear the similarly distorting pro palestinian pro arab element in this newsgroup as well as in soc culture arabic there is always and excuse there is always a rationale to explain why things happen as they do and what is the worst part for me there seems to be all the time an intention to try to de humanize the other as if the other did not care about their future children peace etc etc aap i agree agree agree agree however in my response to the initial discussion above between davidsson and those opposing his presentations i saw davidsson carefully putting academic frills around a blatantly one sided series of i hate dislike them yesido yesido yesido i did not find the approach of those opposing davidsson to be centered at all on a denigration and denial of the other side i certainly do wonder if the degree to which davidsson s views on the middle east have distorted is connected to his dislike and rejection of his jewish lineage having said this however i agree with you that this constant accusing others of being self hating jews seems pointless it is not worse a label than is why you re on their side except to perhaps imply a certain degree of overly enthusiastic biasedness tim tim clock ph d graduate student uci tel department of politics and society fax university of california irvine home tel irvine ca

re europe vs muslim bosnians in article may husc harvard edu stojanov husc harvard edu milan stojanovic writes in article su einnocq mojo eng umd edu josip eng umd edu josip loncaric writes the annihilation of islam turks is an older serbian agenda indeed so was annihilation of germans during wwii however it is important to quote adil zuflikarpasic in his interview to duga had serbs wanted to exterminate muslims they could have done it after the wwi when they were the most loved small nation in europe serbs did not do that although they supressed some rebellions by albanian muslims and bosnian muslims quite bloodily however this is quite a misrepresentation after wwi many bosnian muslims were killed and their land taken over by serbs and the motive was plunder not some fictitious supression of rebellion even earlier one can point to the destruction of mosques in serbia itself and expulsion of muslims here is what dr vaso cubrilovic political adviser to the serbian monarchic regime says in his memorandum the expulsion of the arnauts which he presented to the royal government of stojadinovic on march in belgrade the mode of removal describes how expulsion of ethnic albanians from kosova is to proceed through state terror and private initiative i e chetnik plunder private initiative too can assist greatly in this direction we should distribute weapons to our colonists as need be the old forms of chetnik action should be organized and secretly assisted the whole affair should be presented as a conflict between clans and if need be ascribed to economic reasons finally local riots can be incited these will be bloodily suppressed with the clans and the chetniks rather than the army there remains one more means which serbia employed with great practical effect after that is by secretly burning down albanian villages and city quarters emphasis above is mine these events in serbia itself forced out virtually all muslims during late th century this policy of state terrorism against muslims aided by chetnik private initiative has continued in wwii and today for example muhamed hadzijahic in his book od tradicije do identiteta geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih muslimana sarajevo svjetlost writes pg how serbs killed a muslim in foca in wwii even though he claimed to be a serbian patriot explaining their action as follows inasmuch as you were a serb you sullied the serb name because you are a turk i e muslim and since you helped us we shall not torture you so the shot him instead of cutting his throat in the past year serbs have repeated the slaughter of muslim residents of foca destruction of mosques including priceless historical monuments completes the eradication of the muslim presence from territories claimed by serbs i strongly dispute your notion that croats had a similar older agenda in fact for the past century or two croats and muslims have seen themselves as having a lot in common and they generally had friendly relations your suggestion that croat muslim relationship is anything like serb muslim relationship is completely wrong to say that croats and muslims have a lot in common does not imply they are not separate peoples how touching i have nearly cried while i read this unfortunately mostly untrue which part do you claim is untrue explain yourself or withdraw your claim croats from croatia mostly had no contacts with muslims since they were mostly dealt with extreme preudice long time ago however one of the main agendas is turning bosnia into purely catholic state croatia never had many muslim citizens for historical reasons because it was not a part of the ottoman empire the last major battles between austro hungarian monarchy and the ottoman empire in croatia were at the end of the th century need i remind you that modern croatian nationalism came into being with dr ante starcevic who saw bosnian muslims as the best croats so much so that in he contemplated moving his operations to sarajevo you are confusing clericalist croatianism with croatian nationalism here political nationalism has always been stronger as for your other theories you are clearly overjoyed that croat muslim alliance in bosnia herzegovina is now in trouble arguments such as yours are clearly intended to create and deepen this split i should add few more things a j evans in his on foot through b h describes that catholic clergy in the last century was apparently more scared by serbs then by turks because serbs were growing stronger and unlike turks represented great danger for idea of catholic bosnia president tudjman clearly states in his book that muslims do not exist as a separate nation from croats and serbs and he many times suggested even in interviewes to foreign papers that solution is to split bosnia josip knows this and he is only working on the image of croatia in international relations you ll learn that unless weak unite to counterbalance the strong player soon they are taken over and that s the end of them balance of power thinking has brought together croats and bosnian muslims this is only natural all other alignments are unstable i m working on pointing out this basic fact croats and muslims have been aware of it for as long as serbia has existed you are wrong if you think only image is at stake here croatia has a deep interest in her alliance with bosnian muslims and vice versa i think tudjman understands this although he does not have much choice at this point tensions should have been defused better earlier before any open confrontation developed although i still think croatia will survive it will lose a lot but bosnian muslims may end up even worse off however their position now is so horrible that perhaps they do not see it getting any worse the key point is do they still have any hope left if not then all bets are off mr stojanovic is clearly very very happy about this i m deeply hurt this is not about some image but about survival of a concept of a partnership which i believe is natural and essential for both croats and muslims sigh josip

since kojian s grandparents slaughtered more than kurds in article galaxy ucr edu raffi watnxt ucr edu raffi r kojian writes sedar you seem to have your nationalities mixed up when did you become a spokesman for kurds since your criminal grandparents ruthlessly exterminated more than kurds between and in eastern anatolia referring to notes from the personal diary of russian general l odishe liyetze on the turkish front he wrote on the nights march alone armenian butchers bayoneted and axed to death muslims in areas surrounding erzincan these barbars threw their victims into pits most likely dug according to their sinister plans to extinguish muslims in groups of my adjutant counted and unearthed such pits this is an act against our world of civilization on march lieut colonel griyaznof wrote from an official russian account of the turkish genocide roads leading to villages were littered with bayoneted torsos dismembered joints and carved out organs of muslim peasants alas mainly of women and children source doc dr azmi suslu russian view on the atrocities committed by the armenians against the turks ankara universitesi ankara pp document no archive no cabin no drawer no file no section no contents no acting commander of erzurum and deveboynu regions and commander of the second erzurum artillery regiment prisoner of war lieutenant colonel toverdodleyov the things i have heard and seen during the two months until the liberation of erzurum by the turks have surpassed all the allegations concerning the vicious degenerate characteristic of the armenians during the russian occupation of erzurum no armenian was permitted to approach the city and its environs while the commander of the first army corps general kaltiyin remained in power troops including armenian enlisted men were not sent to the area when the security measures were lifted the armenians began to attack erzurum and its surroundings following the attacks came the plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder of the owners of these houses plundering was widely committed by the soldiers this plunder was mainly committed by armenian soldiers who had remained in the rear during the war one day while passing through the streets on horseback a group of soldiers including an armenian soldier began to drag two old men of seventy years in a certain direction the roads were covered with mud and these people were dragging the two helpless turks through the mud and dirt it was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and traps the turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds and withdrew the reason was that most of the turks who were on night patrol did not return and no one knew what had happened to them the turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear also finally the court martial which had been established for the trials of murderers and plunderers began to liquidate itself for fear that they themselves would be punished the incidents of murder and rape which had decreased began to occur more frequently sometime in january and february a leading turkish citizen haci bekir efendi from erzurum was killed one night at his home the commander in chief odiselidge gave orders to find murderers within three days the commander in chief has bitterly reminded the armenian intellectuals that disobedience among the armenian enlisted men had reached its highest point that they had insulted and robbed the people and half of the turks sent outside the city had not returned we learnt the details this incident from the commander in chief odishelidge they were as follows the killings were organized by the doctors and the employers and the act of killing was committed solely by the armenian renegades more than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless turks have been killed in erzincan large holes were dug and the defenceless turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes later the murdered turks were thrown into the holes the armenian who stood near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses seventy dead bodies well this hole can take ten more thus ten more turks would be cut into pieces thrown into the hole and when the hole was full it would be covered over with soil the armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently fill a house with eighty turks and cut their heads off one by one following the erzincan massacre the armenians began to withdraw towards erzurum the armenian renegades among those who withdrew to erzurum from erzincan raided the moslem villages on the road and destroyed the entire population together with the villages during the transportation of the cannons ammunition and the carriages that were outside the war area certain people were hired among the kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages while the travellers were passing through erzurum the armenians took advantage of the time when the russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill the kurds they had hired when the russian soldiers heard the cries of the dying kurds they attempted to help them however the armenians threatened the russian soldiers by vowing that they would have the same fate if they intervened and thus prevented them from acting all these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with hatred and loathing lieutenant medivani from the russian army described an incident that he witnessed in erzurum as follows an armenian had shot a kurd the kurd fell down but did not die the armenian attempted to force the stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying kurd however since the kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony the armenian failed in his attempt having seen this the armenian ripped open the abdomen of the kurd disembowelled him and finally killed him by stamping him with the iron heel of his boot odishelidge himself told us that all the turks who could not escape from the village of ilica were killed their heads had been cut off by axes he also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered children lieutenant colonel gryaznov who passed through the village of ilica three weeks after the massacre told us the following there were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces on the roads every armenian who happened to pass through these roads cursed and spat on the corpses in the courtyard of a mosque which was about x meter square dead bodies were piled to a height of centimeters among these corpses were men and women of every age children and old people the women s bodies had obvious marks of rape the genitals of many girls were filled with gun powder a few educated armenian girls who worked as telephone operators for the armenian troops were called by lieutenant colonel gryaznov to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be proud of what the armenians had done to the lieutenant colonel s disgusted amazement the armenian girls started to laugh and giggle instead of being horrified the lieutenant colonel had severely reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour when he told the girls that the armenians including women were generally more licentious than even the wildest animals and that their indecent and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity and barbarity before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers the armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and claimed they had laughed because they were nervous an armenian contractor at the alaca communication zone command narrated the following incident which took place on february the armenians had nailed a turkish women to the wall they had cut out the women s heart and placed the heart on top of her head the great massacre in erzurum began on february the enlisted men of the artillery division caught and stripped people then they took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts people among this group were able to save their lives as the result of my decisive attempts the others the armenians claimed were released when they learnt that i understood what was going on among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the armenian officers karagodaviev today some turks were murdered on the streets on february some armenians have shot more than ten innocent moslems the russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were threatened with death meanwhile i imprisoned an armenian for murdering an innocent turk when an armenian officer told an armenian murderer that he would be hanged for his crime the killer shouted furiously how dare you hang an armenian for killing a turk in erzurum the armenians burned down the turkish market on february i heard that the entire population of tepekoy village situated within the artillery area had been totally annihilated on the same day when antranik entered erzurum i reported the massacre to him and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible act however no result was achieved in the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred there was a natural silence on the night of february the armenians deceived the russians perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the turkish soldiers later it was understood that this massacre had been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular the population had been herded in a certain place and then killed one by one the number of murders committed on that night reached three thousand it was the armenians who bragged to about the details of the massacre the armenians fighting against the turkish soldiers were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even withstand the turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred people and two cannons for one night and ran away the leading armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre however the armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with the renegades in this massacre just as in all the others the lower classes within the armenian community have always obeyed the orders of the leading armenian figures and commanders i do not like to give the impression that all armenian intellectuals were accessories to these murders no for there were people who opposed the armenians for such actions since they understood that it would yield no result however such people were only a minority furthermore such people were considered as traitors to the armenian cause some have seemingly opposed the armenian murders but have supported the massacres secretly some on the other hand preferred to remain silent there were certain others who when accused by the russians of infamy would say the following you are russians you can never understand the armenian cause the armenians had a conscience they would commit massacres and then would flee in fear of the turkish soldiers the incidents that occurred only recently clearly manifest the real nature of the armenian ideology nothing which is already done can be undone serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the

you have presented your opinions as opposed to mine i would hardly take them as facts because you don t agree with them hmm no because a fact and an opinion are two different things what you are expressing here are opinions not facts in the abstract what you re saying is true but the facts happen to agree with me and disagree completely with you i could give you hundreds of words in my mother tongue spanish that are comonly use and you will never find in a dictionary even more i could show you a lot of meanings that words in spanish have different from those in the dictionary we re talking about the latter not the former and what you re talking about is slang in the latter that clearly has never been the case here no i am not talking about slang i am talking about different uses of the same language in different places listen pinkas i m going to count on the supposition that you think through the opinions you have something which is by the way against my better judgment based on what i ve seen from you to date we are agreed aren t we that dictionaries are reference books for the usage of a given language and in particular for the meanings of the words and phrases which comprise that language now you are using meanings completely different from indeed in some cases diametrically different from those given in the dictionary as a reference book a dictionary contains those meanings in both past and as much as it can in current use that s also why they are updated so often now if you are saying things which you give different meanings than the dictionary does and using non standard meanings about every word what is your chance of being taken at face value just about none just about no one will take you that way because the words mean something different to them it s quite clear to me from the response this thread has been getting that that is exactly what is happening ponder that and guess why isn t it curious that we do not know how many people define in how many different ways the term jew which is the basis of the movement itself no probably because the question hasn t been asked gee i hate it when people draw conclusions without information don t you i hate people who cannot read i did not draw any conclusion i just said that it is curious considering how heterogeneous the movement is what you did was ask a leading question in english idiom the phrase and guess why in the way you used it is a loaded question with only one answer expected i also take offense at being told i cannot read by someone who is obviously having trouble with the subject himself mr pinkas i am a phd candidate in my field one does not get to phd candidacy if one cannot read the law of return and jewish nationality is defined in terms of religion and not of cultural identity even if of those defined as jews in isreal are not religious for the umpteenth time it is not defined in terms of religion this has been proven to you over and over again no it has not the law of return defines a jew as someone who has a jewish mother and has not converted to another religion that is pretty the same as the religious definition that is a problem i am saying that i do not support zionism as it is now i believe that among the people in the soviet communist party some might even had been inspired by noble ideals does that change the final results of what happened in the ussr are you now wishing to compare the ussr and israel or what israel does not practice cruelty now i understand you are unable to make abstractions you cannot get the idea from a text and you take everything literally bad thing balderdash you know this is false i would be able to make the abstraction if it bore any resemblance to the facts of the matter yours did not the analogy is utterly inapplicable i wouldn t be in the field i m in astrophysics if i couldn t make abstractions and speculate about the general grand scheme of things i also wouldn t be in education which i am and my students give me rather good reviews i d add if i couldn t draw such analogies about israel not practicing cruelty ask those palestinians in israeli prisons those who were tortured those whose houses had been blown by the army the vast majority of palestinians in israeli prisons aren t tortured and their houses weren t blown up by the army in fact you ve seen me protesting such measures on this net before are you now trying to intimate my agreement with them i never said it directly nor indirectly i am not talking about individuals who defined themselves as zionists here i am sure most of them are good honest and caring people i am talking about the results of the zionist movement in other words you are taking that as a monolith and ignoring the dissension within it disagreement that is expressed freely and is widely based just as bad can you read or are you just typing at random do you know the meanings of the words you use or do you expect the reader to read your mind i can read just fine thank you and i don t need someone who is obviously having some troubles with a tongue which isn t his native one telling me how to read the words in my own native tongue if it were spanish i d ask you i am talking about a movement whose actions resulted in a law of return with a religious definition of jew a country that defines nationality based on religion then you re not talking about the movement as it exists today as i ve been trying to tell you please read the arguments i ve given you if you can still say this after reading them you need to read them again i am talking about something i consider a form of racism such as differenciation based on religious belief after all if arabs in israel cannot serve in the army is becasue they were not born in the right religion arabs in israel not only can but do serve in the idf as you well know they can serve it is true but they are not allowed to do the all the same things as the israeli citizens who happen to be jews yes they are as you well know ok fine now we know what you re talking about but do you see my point about how your words could easily have been taken differently it is not we it was you as in the second person in singular who cannot understand a text if things are not explicitly said balderdash see above once again you have a lot of gall and absolutely no right to lecture a native speaker of a language who is well educated in it in a language which isn t your own native tongue and with which you re obviously having problems so there is no difference between citizenship and nationality in israel or what do you mean by actually it doesn t i mean exactly that arab and jewish citizens of israel have the same rights if there is no difference between them why keeping them in id s better yet are you going to tell me that there are no differences in social life between arabs and jews social life is one thing legal status is another once again this is a leading question so it follows a religious definition and not a cultural one that is what i call a form of racism no because the jewish religion and culture are intimately inseparably intertwined if one renounces judaism one renounces judaism i do not believe that this is true final question is it possible to be both jewish and muslim jewish and christian your response will be enlightening how sad to see a model of decorum and tranquillity become like any other sport a battleground for rival ideologies to slug it out with glee tim rice chess eric s perlman perlman qso colorado edu center

nobody knows his name i don t mean to sound disrespectful but since the majority of the contributors and may be even readers of this newsgroup seem to be muslims christians and jews my question could be of some interest to any of them it s my impression that both islam and christianity pay great respect to an obscure st century jewish lad from judea galilee why they chose this particular jew among all possible jews is a mystery to me personally i prefer woody allen his stories are much juicier but perhaps it s an accident of history anyway it seems that they may be talking about two different jews according to the new testament his father s name was joseph while in qur an he appears as zachariah who s right and why the name difference i m really curious david
re saudi clergy and their western supporters vs human rights ilyess sez so how would have you defended saudi arabia and rolled back the iraqi invasion were you in charge of saudi arabia all muslims knew that the whole thing was set up to destroy iraq not to liberate kuwait the people who were killed by the invasion are more many many more than the ones that were killed by the iraqis in their smaller invasion i lived in the west and i have seen how your media prepared you helpless naive americans for a war against no doubt you plan on exploiting helpless naive americans for your own purposes hmm let s see iraq even before the artificial conflict between iraq and kuwait that led to the invasion as the cia correctly predicted and pretended to be surprised not to know it just happened that saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid what would i have done most muslims would choose dead kuwaitis over dead iraqis and dead kuwaitis the first case would happen if no western intervention happened and the second case was a direct or indirect result of western envolvement possibly if iraqis had indeed died but this number is based on greenpeace estimates greenpeace had compromised its alleged impartiality during the war by condemning the potential environmental consequences of allied miiltary action while initially completely ignoring iraq s horrible environmental crimes starting with the dumping of millions of barrels of oil into the gulf at ahmadi to the blowing of over oil wells what is the real number there has been a lot of work on this in the last two years none of it reported as the greenpeace figure seems to get continuously bandied about the real number seems to be around on the same order as the number of kuwaitis killed tortured and kidnapped during the occupation i ve included an article i recently posted below but this is really old news independent television news reported a figure around only a few months after the war but it was hardly reported for the allies to have killed iraqis they would have had to kill twice the total number of iraqis in kuwait the favored image of the hysterics is the last battle of the war at mutla this was yet another example of the american and european media playing into the hands of iraq and its de facto allies the destruction of the iraqi convoy at mutla was portrayed as an all out slaughter this is simply not true the head and tail of the convoy was bombed initially resulting in a lot of casualties at these points before bombers came back most of the rest of the iraqi soldiers fled on foot furthermore your estimates of kuwaiti war dead if allies hadn t invaded is completely ridiculous you have acknowledged certainly implicitly that saddam is a barbarous brute you have acknowledged the hundreds of thousands he has been responible for killing in his own country you know that the man he appointed as governor of kuwait ali majid was his most brutal henchman presiding over the near genocide of the kurds in the late s and more recently the shi a yet when it comes to his treatment of kuwaitis he is an angel in your estimate he would ve killed fewer than he already had when the war started what a joke apn iraq war dead copyright the associated press all rights reserved by nick ludington associated press writer washington ap after the persian gulf war ended the world was told that as many as iraqi soldiers were killed at one point even baghdad put the toll that high as did the u s defense intelligence agency in private but u s officials have been backpedaling ever since even though the pentagon has yet to settle on an official estimate to release to the public now one former dia analyst says the number of iraqi troops killed may have been as low as that conclusion by john heidenrich writing in the current issue of the quarterly magazine foreign policy represents the lowest estimate yet from u s defense sources the revisions suggesting a less devastating iraqi toll fit a pattern of vastly moderated u s military claims in the months after the war ended claims for a number of u s weapons also were scaled down despite the dramatic videotapes of successful weaponry or the shocking pictures of iraq s disastrous retreat from kuwait arguments have continued unabated about what really happened in the gulf war heidenrich is not the first to question the iraqi death toll numbers that originally were aired more that a year ago air force lt gen charles horner the commander of the air campaign in the gulf war said he believed the iraqi military death toll was fewer than for the entire war the pentagon itself still refuses to provide an estimate of the number of iraqis who died in the day war against the u s led coalition in january and february on monday pentagon spokesman lt cmdr joe gradisher reiterated past statements that there just isn t a number that is credible but some current internal estimates range from to iraqi troops killed said one analyst speaking on condition of anonymity who is familiar with the pentagon s reports allied deaths were put at americans by friendly fire british by american fire frenchmen italian and among various arab allies of the postwar reassessments the most widely publicized was the army s reluctant acknowledgement months later that its touted patriot air defense system was nowhere near so effective as claimed against iraq s scud missiles the bush administration initially claimed an almost perfect record for the patriot last spring it revised the hit ratio to percent the success record of the navy s tomahawk high tech cruise missile used against targets in baghdad and other parts of iraq also turned out to be more modest than initially indicated by the pentagon the first iraqi casualty figures to surface after the war came in a may report by the environmental group greenpeace which said to iraqi soldiers were killed it estimated that to iraqi civilians were also killed the same month published reports said the defense intelligence agency estimated iraqi soldiers were killed and wounded in the air and ground campaigns although the agency qualified that by saying the estimate could be off by as much as percent in either direction but as more information became available those figures gradually were revised downward the house armed services committee staff estimated dead and wounded after a review last year but heidenrich writing in the current issue of the quarterly foreign policy estimated the total death toll from both the air and ground offensives as low as with about wounded heidenrich based the conclusion in his article on the number of bodies found and buried by u s troops and on prisoner of war interviews he noted that only about of iraqi prisoners of war were wounded based on the calculation that about half as many wounded escaped as were captured he put the number of wounded at about using a conservative ratio of one dead to two wounded applicable to third world armies like iraq he set battlefield deaths at maybe the figures are too low he wrote maybe the real death toll on the battlefield was or or even even then the evidence suggests a death toll of well below or even in an interview he said the figure was obviously off base because it would mean that virtually all the iraqi soldiers in the kuwait theater of operations were casualties he said today s bloodiest wars were not those fought with high technology but rather the drawn out conflicts such as those in yugoslavia and somalia

light on september the national council on us arab relations invited the kuwaiti ambassador to the united states saud nasser al sabah the following are quotes of his speech kuwait itself was an entity identified as kuwait even before iraq was identified as iraq in the ottoman empire kuwait was in existence since we continued to be in existence until the conflict between the ottoman empire and the british and others in the area thereafter we signed with the british in a protective agreement whereby the british guaranteed the sovereignty and security of kuwait in the british and the ottoman signed an agreement defining without any doubt the borders of kuwait as they stand today such an agreement was reconfirmed in between the kuwaiti government and the iraqi government at that time that is when iraq became a state after kuwait itself in when we declared our independence iraq seized the opportunity to claim kuwait as part of iraq there were threats the british came in and arab forces came in to guarantee the sovereignty and territorial integrity of kuwait in kuwait and iraq again signed border agreement thereby defining our territory and iraq s recognition to the sovereignty and territory of kuwait compiled by firyal alshalalbi origins of kuwait the establishment of kuwait is attributed to barrak b ghurair of the bani khalid who used kuwait as a summer residence the beginning of kuwait goes back to the late th century and some historians go further up to kuwait s name is derived from al kut which means fortress kuwait is also called qurain which is the diminutive of qarn a horn or hill kuwait town flourished and grew since its establishment the utub al sabah family is a branch of utub settled in kuwait during the early th century they lived under the protection of bani khalid until after that they became independent and sabah bin jabir was chosen as the first ruler for utub carsten niebuhr a dutch explorer was among the first who wrote about the arabia he was the mathematician in the scientific expedition sent in by the king of denmark to arabia he documented details of arab tribes inhabiting both coasts of the gulf and in the case of kuwait he was the first writer to give the two names by which the town was known kuwait and qurain niebuhr s chart of the persian gulf was the best one drawn before the end of that century see the map from abu hakima history of eastern arabia pub al sabah utub kept good relations with other powers in the eastern arabia according to ahmed abu hakima s conclusions in his well documented study about the history of eastern arabia between there was no ottoman rule on the region in the second half of the th century there was no ottoman ruler in eastern arabia in fact ottoman rule was not even nominally acknowledged their attempts to restore their lost position in al hasa through the campaign of thuwayni in and ali pasha s expedition against the wahhabis in were unsuccessful at kuwait the nearest point of the utbi domains to the ottoman mutasallimiyya of basra the shaikh was under no form of ottoman control the aim of utbi external policy was to keep on friendly relations with all the forces working in the gulf p abu hakima continued in his conclusions that kuwait was not a dependency of basra the persian occupation of basra did not affect kuwait p kuwait had its own identity through the ottoman domination on the arab world this identity was clear to the british and the french who tried to win the support of kuwait s sheikh between when the british wanted his support in their conflict with the french in the gulf area independent kuwait this is the first of a series of articles that testify to the independence of kuwait throughout its history from both iraq and the ottomans the following text is related to an expedition carried out by the ottomans in against the wahhabis in eastern arabia where the oil fields in saudi arabia now kuwait and its ruler at that time sheikh abdulla ibn sabah ibn jabir allied themselves with the turks abdullah role in the fighting was not a minor one he joined the expedition as a commander of the large kuwaiti fleet and was the first to use its guns against the besieged town of al qatif had it not been for this bombardment by the kuwaiti fleet al qatif obviously would not have surrendered in a mere three hours in relation to this a question arises as to why the ottoman warships refrained from participating in the bombardment the answer lies in reports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of the progress of the expedition because the ottomans were unwilling to jeopardize the maritime peace imposed by britain in the area the sultan and the pasha promised their warships would not be used in the war against su ud or any sheikh in the war zone kuwait which was not a party to the above mentioned treaty of was under no such obligation especially since the expedition was not directed against those who had signed it from the above text we can see that kuwait was not part of the ottomans or the british colonies for more details about the mentioned expedition please check out the source of the above text the modern history of kuwait by ahmed abu hakima mcgill university canada independent kuwait this is another article of a series of articles that testify to the independence of kuwait throughout its history from both iraq and the ottomans the following text discusses a dispute on an estate called sufiyya in zubair iraq between the sheikh of kuwait and al zuhair tribe in zubair in trouble developed over the possession by sheikh sabah of the estate which was purchased by his father sheikh jabir in this property was sequestered by a turkish qa immaqam representative on the basis of a claim by the al zuhair that the vendor had been the owner of a share and not of the n e sufiyya at the same time sheikh sabah was required to expel from other lands owned by him at the island of fao some cultivators who had immigrated from persian territory it should be recalled that the turkish officials from the start showed strong prejudice in favor of the zuhair claimants abdulla ibn sabah the eldest son of the ruler of kuwait who went to basra as his father s agent in the case narrowly escaped being thrown into jail upon his refusal to make a payment amounting to the value of seven years produce which the ottoman authorities deemed the plaintiffs were entitled to receive eventually the dispute was settled by the wali governor of baghdad in favor of the sheikh of kuwait the decision of the governor of basra in favor of the sheikh was apparently made for various reasons some writers think that the governor wanted to win abdulla over to the turkish side and suggest that the governor namiq pasha even offered him the title of qa immaqam which he declined nevertheless the proceedings of the turks in this case were regarded by the inhabitants of kuwait as attempts to cause a confrontation with zubair it seems that they had anticipated a conflict and according to reports by the british agent at basra the people of kuwait were prepared to a man to abandon their town rather than submit to turkish rule lorimer suggests that the final order of namiq pasha upholding the kuwait sheikh s title to sufiyya was perhaps due to a report that sheikh sabah with the object of attacking zubair if the decision should go against him had obtained a promise of countenance and armed support from the wahhabi amir in addition to this legal matter with zubair kuwait had had other problems with basra whose courts tried to jail abdulla ibn sabah as explained above however kuwait s relations with the ottoman mutasallims of basra had at times been amicable and in several instances those mutasallims even sought refuge at kuwait when pressured by the pashas of baghdad who exercised control over them source the modern history of kuwait by ahmed abu hakima mcgill university canada independent kuwait this is another article that testifies to the independence of kuwait throughout its history from both iraq and the ottomans when pelly colonel pelly the british resident in the gulf visited kuwait for the first time on march he was met at jahra by sheikh mubarak the second son of the ruler sheikh sabah just before he reached kuwait town on march he was met by sheikh abdulla the eldest son and heir apparent who accompanied him to the town gate on their way to a very good home which had been prepared for pelly and his companions scarcely had we entered it says pelly when sheikh sabah himself came this description of pelly s reception indicates that to a certain degree it was run according to protocol the government system of kuwait and administration of justice were the subject of comments made by pelly the government is patriarchal says pelly the sheikh managing the political and the cazee qadi the judicial departments the sheikh himself would submit to the cazee s decision punishment was rarely inflicted indeed there seems little government interference anywhere and little need of an army pelly in admiration of how the sheikh ran the affairs of the country retold the following remark which the sheikh had made to him when my father was nearly years old he called me and said i shall soon die i have made no fortune and can leave you no money but i have made many and true friends grapple them while other states around the gulf have fallen off from injustice or ill government mine has gone on flourishing hold to my policy and though you are surrounded by desert and pressed by a once hostile and still wandering set of tribes you will prosper source the modern history of kuwait by ahmed abu hakima mcgill university canada independent kuwait this is another article that testifies to the independence of kuwait throughout its history from both iraq and the ottomans the british had always regarded sheikh jabir as a good friend but in october an event took place at kuwait which could have weakened those good relations on october lieutenant edmunds the assistant resident at abu shahr in iran arrived in kuwait on a special mission from the resident captain hennell his mission was to find out if kuwait was willing to welcome the establishment of a british line of post across the desert from kuwait to the mediterranean the british war vessel fired the usual salute in honor of the sheikh after it had anchored in the waters of kuwait bay the salute was not acknowledged and edmunds waited in the vessel for three days before he was able to communicate with the sheikh after edmunds return to abu shahr both he and captain hennell explained this unusual behavior of the sheikh to have been due not to ill will but principally to a desire to mislead the egyptian agent at kuwait as to the nature of his relations with the british therefore they considered that jabir s conduct did not indicate any change in his friendly policies towards the british if the british tolerated the attitude of jabir towards edmunds so also did the egyptians earlier in the same year some of the most wanted men in the wahhabi camp such as umar ibn ufaisan the wahhabi general in al hasa and wahhabi tribes like al duwaish sought refuge in kuwait protection of refugees seeking political asylum in his country was a policy that had been adopted earlier by sheikh abdulla ibn sabah this can therefore be looked upon as an indication of self confidence an outcome of kuwait s independence from foreign powers it corroborates the fact that kuwait if necessary was prepared to defend itself against more powerful neighbors this defense depended not only on the walls of the city but also on bedouin tribes in its neighborhood and a merchant fleet equipped with the necessary guns comparable to other arab fleets of the time as to kuwait s position between and one can safely state that it managed to maintain a neutral policy with regard to the struggling wahhabis and egyptians relations with the british and even with the pasha of baghdad continued on good terms source the modern history of kuwait by ahmed abu hakima mcgill university canada they were trying to recover land they believed was theirs much like the argentines in the faulklands the kuwaitis pushed just a little too far by taking iraqi oil and saddam thought he d settle the dispute the old fashioned way are you really this cartoonish or do you seriously believe this if so please post your proof everybody would have been much better off had they left the reunited iraq together and concentrated on taking out saddam a strong united iraq with an elected government would have gone a long way to ridding the world of the feudal dictatorships in the gulf are standards at uwisc dropping since when has iraq ever had an elected government

again where is your non existent list of scholars and scholarly sources here is mine an appropriate analogy with the jewish holocaust might be the systematic extermination of the entire muslim

issued a threat recently if one could believe the yerevan agency snark the armenians in karabakh presented an ultimatum to authorities in azerbaijan the essence of this ultimatum is that if russian soldiers are not shown mercy three azeri prisoners in karabakh will be shot dead it is simple to explain such touching attitude of armenians to the six russian soldiers fate if by chance the sentence

some scientists do not believe in the green house effect the following statement was released on february by the science environmental policy project as independent scientists researching atmosphere and climate problems we are concerned by the agenda for unced the united nations conference on environment and development being developed by environmental and activists groups and certain political leaders this so called earth summit is scheduled to convene in brazil in june and aims to impose a system of global envionmental regulations including onerous taxes on energy fuels on the population of the united states and other industrialized nations such policy initiatives derive from highly uncetain scientific theories they are based on the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warming follows from the burning of fossill fuels and requires immediate action we do not agree a survey of u s atmospheric scientists conducted in the summer of confirms that there is no consesensus about the cause of the slight warming observed during the past century a recently published research paper even suggests sunspot variability which is directly proportional to solar activity rather than a rise in greenhouse gases is responsible for the global temperature increases and decreases recoded since about futhermore the majority of scientific participants in the survey agreed that the theoretical climate climate models used to predict a future warming cannot be relied upon and are not validated by the existing climate record yet all predictions are based on such theoretical models finally agriculturalits generally agree that any increase in carbon dioxide levels from fossil fuels burning has beneficial effects on most crops and on world food supply we are disturbed that activists anxious to stop energy and economic growth are pushing ahead with drastic policies without taking notice of recent changes in the underlying science we fear that the rush to impose global regulations will have catastrophic impacts on the world economy on jobs standards of living and health care with the most severe consequences falling on developing countries and the poor david b

re median re new study out on gay percentage stephen orchid ucsc edu wrote the median of a distribution is that variate value which divides the distribution halfway i e of the distribution population have lower and half have higher variate values so for males the median this means that half of these men are higher than this and half are lower than this now if the population sample size is and of them are gay males are gay if we say they are distributed equally then only are greater than sexual partners of course this means that heterosexual men are greater than not quite first the median does not imply that half of the men are above and half below it simply means that is the mid point between the maximum number of partners and the minimum which is most likely zero however assuming your implication to be more or less correct your final result is still invalid if of all males have had more than partners and you deduct the assumed of homosexual males what remains is not but still of all heterosexual males which is to say hey we re all human garison

re waco survivors april in article c segz mwr dscomsa desy de hallam zeus desy de writes the people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire government story this is simply rationalisation it is not enough for them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent that would require them to come up with a solution themselves instead they have to come up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to set out to murder people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them to get gun control legislation through what s despicable is that this sordid incident is being glommed onto by all sorts of people desperately trying to get a revolution it makes ambulance chasing by lawyers seem like a harmless pastime for the last few months benighted souls have been calling c span on issues as mundane as budget resolutions saying that i don t know i just have the feeling there is going to be a revolution in this country and so on get real for a real case study in revolution go to blockbuster video and check out underground a film made about the weather underground in the s even with all the strife back then the revolution never did come and waco is supposed to be the spark of the end times in the tape it is interesting to see the way the weatherpersons dance around the issue of one of their defining moments which was when a few of their comrades managed to blow themselves up manufacturing bombs in a greenwich village townhouse the problem one of them said was that they were so caught up in their armed struggle that they forgot about their own personal safety and weren t careful but of course that was society s fault a society that didn t instill a sense of worth in the people so they neglect their own safety current apologists for koresh may pick up some important rationalization tips from this tape joe knapp jmk cbvox att com

he just doesn t get it re will they ever learn in article d f b w w cellar org techie cellar org william a bacon writes they refuse to learn from history or from the present pointing to canada s vaunted socialized medical care program he contends that it is failing even while the cost is catching up with angry taxpayers he notes americans don t go to canada and elsewhere for medical care it s the canadians and others who come here why should the united states duplicate what doesn t work well in other countries we have the world s best medical care let s not mess it up with hillary clinton s plans for socialized medicine john f mcmanus national president of the john birch society when mcmanus says we have the world s best medical care i can hardly believe he s referring to a system that costs us percent of our gdp while there isn t a single other country in the industrialized world that spends more than percent that leaves million of us with no coverage even though all the other systems in the industrialized world cover virtually everyone yet americans rank near the bottom of the list in terms of life expectancy childhood immunization rate infant mortality and many preventable diseases we pay on average about each for mris to put that in perspective they cost in japan the average us company spends over dollars a year per employee on health benefits seven hundred to is the range just about everywhere else how can anyone say that such a system is the best in the world the only thing the usa health care system is good at is showering well insured patients with a champagne treatment of care and outrageously overcharging for it and the private system of insurers and paperwork is so bloated and inefficient that it itself sucks up over billion dollars a year in money from every other sector of society individuals government and industry of the billion dollars americans threw into the bottomless pit of health care costs last year the consumer s union estimated that at least billion was thrown away on overpriced useless and even downright harmful tests and procedures and the most bureaucratic regulated insurance system in the world there are more than different private insurers in the usa but did the private competition stimulate more efficient paperwork ask any doctor who s had to hire a full time clerk to deal with it all the competition among hospitals is driving costs up not down the competition among hospitals for both doctors and patients has encouraged the hospitals to traffic in expensive superfluous equipment spending millions on expensive machines of dubious value that spend percent of the day idle isn t my idea of the world s best health care system competition among specialists is driving them to perform dangerous and expensive procedures where they are very marginally helpful i m especially thinking of heart surgery and some women s surgeries like hysterectomy and cesarean section sound like the world s best health care system ever notice how every time someone tries to bring about some real change in health care the libbies start bashing canada s system first of all hillary clinton is not advocating another canadian system i think that s been made abundantly clear in the news for the last couple of months where did john f mcmanus get that idea anyway let s say you re a canadian living in a small town near the usa border your child needs a complicated procedure only available in city hospitals the nearest canadian cities are hours west and hours east and there s an american city one hour south which way are you going to go is it because the american system is the best in the world or just for convenience it still amazes me that people can t seem to see more than just black and white on health care reform there are a million different ways we ould restructure the system it s not just a choice between total government control and total private control i wish the people screaming socialized medicine every time soemone wants to change the current syste would inform themselves on health care issues the current system sucks i want to keep providers private but that doesn t change the fact that we will never be able to deal with the deficit if we don t reform the health care system purely private health care without any government intervention doesn t work hillary clinton is not thinking of nationalizing providers or evern insurers how can you scream socialized medicine at her programs don t you even know what you re talking about ever see clinton s graphs of projected deficit versus year for the rest of the decade notice how the line falls then starts increasing why i ll give you one wild guess as to which component of spending will overwhelm us if we don t do something about it peope just doesn t get it the current health care system is a cancer which is killing our economic well being costs are still rising percent a year even as americans by the tens of millions go without or are forced into managed care programs which are certainly pretty socialized already if you ask me a couple of months ago i posted a message asking any hillary bashers to please come forward and present no gimmicks straight talk just how they would set about keeping costs down i didn t get a single answer the only thing i keep hearing from libbie organizations are press releases filled with evasive platitudes like give health care back to the people just do you expect to do that without serious reforms what is it about the current system that you would change and how would that help how can anyone read the news live under our system and not see these faults how can we deal with the deficit our cities our educational system our infrastrucure aids modernizing our industry etc if we don t quit throwing away money which could be used to solve those problems america needs health care reform now don t just sit there and hillary bash inform yourself jim reynolds

apm hpopdlau pwd hp com andrew merritt in article apr vms ocom okstate edu chorley vms ocom okstate edu writes i note with insufficient emotion that amongst the five survivors of the waco debacle there were two brits and an aussie the anglo saxon persona really doesn t lend itself to martyrdom for a spurious messiah i don t see how you draw that conclusion around of the inside the buildings were british one quarter two out of the eight latest count i heard survivors were british one quarter anyhow british doesn t equate to anglo saxon what exactly are you trying to say and why were there no fire engines within a mile of the compound because the gun loonies were firing on vehicles with mm amunition that has a range of meters next question the problem is of course the laws that allow a bunch of raving nutters to collect a huge stack of arms in the first place the sequence of events meant that there really was no option but to attempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervention if the fbi had had the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando type raid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the adults it really was a no win situation koresh had plenty of opportunity to give up and stand trial for the murder of the atf officers instead he ordered the murder of the children in order to reject the word of the fbi and batf it is neccessary to beleive the words of a man who has just murdered children and ordered the suicide murder of his other followers according to the account given the batf attempted to serve a warrant upon koresh at the ranch and were met by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them the koresh gun supporter claim that the batf started shooting simply does not stand up if the aft had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier grade weaponry than standard issue handguns for all practical purposes they were unarmed the b d followers had automatic weapons the b d seige could not be allowed to go on indefinitely the b d were quite capable of commiting mass suicide and murdering the children at any time a commando assault was the only other likely action that could have achieved that objective that would have been very risky orders of magintude harder than antebbe or the iranian embassy seige airplanes and embassies are not designed for defense against attack ranch apocalypse was terrorists are far easier to disloge without casualties than allowing the siege to go on was not an option either besides the serious risk that koresh would proclaim armageddon at any moment there was the question of the difficulties of keeping the emmergency team on standby over a prolonged period the longer the siege went on the more mentally prepared koresh and his followers would be for a prolonged siege rather than go in prematurely the mistake was probably to go in too soon can you think of a better way of getting the children out a certain way the people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire government story this is simply rationalisation it is not enough for them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent that would require them to come up with a solution themselves instead they have to come up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to set out to murder people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them to get gun control legislation through this conspiracy theory assumes that the batf deliberately got of its agents killed and that the fbi etc actually enjoy sitting out in the middle of texas being shot at by religious nutters still the conspiracy theory is comforting it allows them to pretend that waco proves nothing except about how incompetent the government is in resolving a hostage crisis no govt in the world has ever faced a comparable situation quite probably there was no manner in which it could be peacefully resolved the blame does not rest on the fbi it rests on the fact that koresh was allowed to get so far in particular the person who tipped the b d off in advance has the murder of atf agents and children on his or her conscience there are a large number of people in the us who predict the end of society preach salvation through armed security the fact is that these are the very people who pose the threat to society in the first place the next waco may not be religious nutters but a political movement a splinter group of the klu klux klan taking over a schoolhouse in a black area for example and holding several hundred children hostage the only possible solution to such situations that can work is to prevent them arising no other government in the world has faced such a situation this is because no other government has so carelessly allowed high power weaponry to become avaliable to any little hitler or would be messiah to set themselves up as dictator in their own little empire phill hallam baker

re eight myths about national health insurance pt ii v pxgt ubvmsb cc buffalo edu daniel b case writes gld cunixb cc columbia edu gary l dare writes v pxgt ubvmsb cc buffalo edu daniel b case writes gld cunixb cc columbia edu gary l dare writes okay but do doctors willingly testify against each other in malpractice cases when they do go to court obviously absolutely essential to prove malpractice it used to be impossible to get doctors here to do that a possible advantage of the us system you won t hear about from the ama our doctors monopoly is exactly the same as in the u s if not more powerful now that they can dictate insurance payment rates but i don t know an answer to this one anecdotally my friends who are md s including my main buds from high school talk about how hard it is to turn state s witness against someone else no direct experience there though also in some circumstances you may have to sue the insurance plan people here after all sue health insurance companies all the time i heard about a guy in alberta who came down with some rare eye disease that he had to take repeated trips to seattle to get treated it cost him and his family something like and the province years later still has only reimbursed them for or so well what american private insurance plans cover travel expenses since our public insurance plans are publicly accountable one can raise a stink in the media to try and extort benefits beyond which one is entitled hey not alberta s fault that he lives there if he lived in cheyenne wy his private insurance would ve told him to go to hell for the travel expenses and that s that an hmo would have just kept quiet and let him go blind well yeah tell us about the national defense medical centre outside ottawa it serves the same purpose as the bethesda naval hospital since not all hospitals can provide everything maybe they have some stuff that others don t ottawa s population is only a quarter million if you include the surrounding counties my point was that something that should necessarily remain unpoliticized has become very politicized to the detriment of its mission i don t think that this has been shown with the dmc the problem is in a system where hospitals annual budgets are approved by the government how do you keep political considerations out of medical decisions i bet that if you re an mp or mpp or good friends with one you re put on any hospital s urgent care list no matter how minor your problem which is ok unless you re someone who gets bumped off the list for some bigshot people of influence will get their way in any system american or european it s the golden rule he who has the gold makes the rules but to what extent does it affect the system and why is an urgent care list necessary in the first place it s worth thinking about it s regular practice in a hospital to figure out who needs to get at what facilities don t americans have to arrange in advance for operations too i think that there are two standards being applied here and that canada can t give beverly hills style treatment to everybody it s not a big brother list it s more like calling around town for a table for dinner yeah but private nonprofit foundations have to make money somehow especially in the hospital business yes and the tories in ottawa are trying to make them do that rather than hope for a bigger grant from the feds and their province the next time around whether it s using mop a couple of weeks longer or even selling services to americans remember our system is cash based and since our health care infrastructure is overbuilt except in specialties that require larger populations to generate business why not the alternative is closing unused wards business whether canadians would be thrilled at the prospect of their own health services catering toward americans who would be willing to pay more than they do is another issue entirely it must be noted that they said they were doing it partly because their grants from the province were getting smaller if those grants are so insubstantial why the need to attract foreigners to make up the difference you answered the question yourself private nonprofit foundations have to make money somehow and i think that it s about time that they acted like the private hospitals that they are personally i m fed up with canadian socialists trying to tell everyone that their health care is free when we are actually buying insurance that s one at you bob rae the gdp figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay and are compiled use the same methods by the oecd that yield the figure for the u s but don t the us figures include dentistry and optometry where the canadian one until recently anyway didn t since we have always been evaluated in an oecd style i don t see how remember oecd counts both private and public funds and in canada like france and germany of health care spending is private funds i e not the basic health insurance money so what happens if the health care systems financially collapse how they are collecting premiums and i m an advocate of having copayments like the french do in their system well if you spend more than you take in you go bankrupt it s that simple if the provincial insurance systems find themselves paying out more than they get in revenue they won t be able to pay for everybody s primary care yes the infrastructure will be there but will everybody be able to continue using it at the same rate minor copayments can flush out abusers remember that our system is only an insurance policy but our costs aren t rising fast enough to ensure adequate copayments deductibles last year quebec s user fee proposal came out with the number of as the necessary hike that could be done through a copayment rather than give the qma a raise and it s not contract time yet as far as i can tell from upi clarinet even the new reform party a breakoff of traditionalists from the conservatives with a mildly libertarian faction holds our public health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to be reminded that it s not free the average canadian european is more fiscally naive than their american counterparts on issues like these but no mention of copayments anywhere to be seen but cutting public spending all over the place and bringing back the death penalty with little haste if elected i know that for pete s sake i live right on the border i know the canadian system isn t socialized medicine unlike britain s nhs sorry it s just that i even run into people from buffalo and from michigan who don t know the point is that means that if the money runs low in the plan you re out of luck unless you can afford it yourself yeah but there d be a lot of lead time and a health care crisis that would preclude it if provincial governments as bad as some of them are heck we have the ndp cleaning up a spending mess made by the conservatives in saskatchewan embarassing can be so irresponsible there is still reallocation health insurance is so important that it s about the only thing that can inspire open rebellion and violent insurrection outside of the hockey rink right now attempts to get the system and its users to learn good habits are being treated like cod liver oil would the private insurers take up the slack they d be under no obligation to of course they could eventually make money again but if what you say is true they d be loathe to do so and out of practice in handling such basic services too some of the companies providing extra insurance are subsidiaries of american companies and their parents provide full insurance down here regardless all firms up north can easily turn on cable tv to see how well the american firms are doing by being involved in basic coverage the private firms are making too much money after having gotten rid of basic coverage they run around patting them selves on the back for their own cooperation in providing extras for those people who deserve it yeah but eventually it s going to create a kind of two tiered effect that will be noticeable after a while like in britain most americans are fearful of a single tier system seriously there are few areas that have sufficient population for a two more tiered system like what the french have a health policy prof d g shea has cited studies in the nejm that indicate having a population of is necessary for adequate competition and in canada there are only four cities west of the great lakes with that population or larger anyways the numbers show that costs have held steadier than those in the u s and barring any future chernobyl like crisis sudden transients in spending are unlikely in fact the health allocation is one of the most well behaved sectors of spending up north so any talk of bankruptcy is talk radio fodder far away from the border if the provinces hit fiscal rough spots and have to cut back the things private insurers have to offer will seem less and less like luxuries and the gap will be more and more noticeable this won t be overnight and something like this would force canada to have a system more like the french one but that s not a bad thing and the change will be minimal i e add copayments and frustrate the socialists chanting hey it s free gld je me souviens gary l dare gld

com matt galaxy nsc com matt freivald x said i like to call the form of government that i advocate fractal federalism with fractal federalism there is a representative national government that has only certain limited powers to do what is absolutely necessary at that level next there are the state governments again with only absolutely necessary powers onward to counties cities townships districts and neighborhoods the lowest read most local levels are the ones that have the most power over individuals day to day lives which is good because that is the level where individuals have the most voice you know if you take all this to its logical conclusion doesn t it seem that the real lowest level the level where individuals have the most voice is that of the single individuals themselves why have you omitted that level from your model yes and the individual is not omitted i just didn t fully articulate the principles of fractal federalism all government powers derive from the people each level can receive a new power from the level below through the amendment process where a true consensus say a majority writes that power into the constitution of the level above in the case of the lowest level an amendement is passed by a majority vote in the case of higher levels it must be passed by of the legislatures we can of course haggle about the specifics of true consensus when we hold our constitutional convention once a power has been granted it may be exercised by the legislature powers not in the original constitutions must percolate upward starting from the individual the ratification process for the original constitutions should involve consensus and not simply a plurality or majority granting a right in a constitution is of course the same as empowering the government at that level to restrict the activities of the governments at the lower levels so it operates in the same way as the amendment process again that crazy resemblance to the supposed but not actual u s government structure this government structure is a very frustrating one for those people read liberals who would like to have concentrated power to use the government to force people to do good a difficult to define word and one that it is difficult to reach a consensus on it is also a frustrating structure for those who want to use the government to dictate personal behavior read big government conservatives i personally would rather see those types of people frustrated than the incredible erosion of liberty both civil and economic that is going on now this is imho a good government stucture for those who see the role of government as the protection of individual liberties while still recognizing that individuals need to have some influence in the type of community that they live in a free market works on government not just economics succesful ideas propogate unsuccessful ideas die what is your definition of a successful idea or a successful government one which maintains peace liberty and the opportunity for happiness for its people while working within the realities of human nature you do bring up the point intentional or not that a lasting idea is by no means necessarily a successful idea i believe that fractal federalism would at least bring many ideas to light and the people would have the opportunity to democratically choose between good ideas and bad ideas if the docialists er i mean democrats are right and government activism fosters a prosperous people they will have a plethora of local opportunities to check their thesis if libertopia is possible it will arise if a balanced conservative republic is democratically received as the best level of government activity it will become clear to the people that it is best as far as set the moral tone is concerned if a community does not collectively want to put up with prostitution going on in front of their kids why should they have to if a community does not want to see proliferation of drugs among their kids why should they have to for the same reason that they have to put up with a church operating right out in the open where their kids can see it and with the owner of the house across the street flying an american flag right out there in the open every day in front of their kids it s called freedom if they don t like the ideas to which their kids are exposed they can try to educate and persuade their kids as to why the things that they re seeing other people doing are wrong or bad right and people would not rescind any freedoms read empower the government except through the amendment process that is how the federal government is supposed to work now but the supreme soviet er i mean the supreme court put a stop to that republican government nonsense in my hypothetical government if there were a constitutional provision empowering the government to regulate churches the government whatever level we are talking about could indeed ban churches the constitutional provision would be invalid if a higher level had a constitutional provision protecting free exercise of religion the uppermost constitution is still the supreme law of the land i find it interesting that you applaud the idea of free market competition among various ideas and yet support the right of he majority in a community to suppress ideas which they don t like it is a matter of individuals being able to control their own associations and environment not a matter of suppression of ideas one dilemma of the human condition is that individuals need liberty and they also need to have some control over their environment in my fractal federalism government certain rights are protected by the constitutions other rights are protected simply because the government has not been empowered to infringe upon them when a consensus is reached that the government should have a certain power then freedom is infringed upon this cannot be avoided murder statutes infringe upon freedom but i think that the consensus of the american people is that murder statutes are a good idea i am sure that many parents believe that they have a right to control the environment that their children live in people feel that they have a right to sleep peacefully at night thus there are noise ordinances there are zoning laws that keep businesses from overrunning residential neighborhoods i do not view these as bad things certainly some individual instances are bad but the concept is not necessarily bad i view them as the people in a community having some control over the type of community that they live in i see the alternative as near anarchy like i said in another post if you can come up with a scenario where an individual can do something truly autonomously with absolutely zero effect on anyone else then no individual or government has the right to restrict that activity there are simply not very many behaviors that fit into the category of the truly autonomous so the whole thing becomes an issue of one individual or group having power over another individual or group i think that the fractal federalism approach is a sound if not ideal approach to limiting this restrictive power the libertarian scenario degenerates to might makes right and the system we have right now is one of lawyers abusing natural rights philosophy to decide what powers the government should have by subverting the democratic process though the supreme court the problem with the egalitarian view is that it tries to deny the fundamental dilemma of democratic government the people have a right to exercise a voice in their community yet individuals have the right to be left to themselves this is a serious dilemma precisely because there is not much that takes place in a vacuum oddly enough if what you say is taken literally there is little or no conflict the people do indeed have a right to exercise a voice where voice equals persuasive speech in their communities it s only when they somehow get the idea into their heads that they also have a right to dictate behavior in their communities that the trouble begins i think i answered this above already but let me expand a little more with an example if i stand naked in front of your house and masturbate in front of your children while they play in your libertarian small l scenario the only recourse you have is to yell at me autonomous is a value judgement of the time it is not a scientific reality with a clear definition exactly who would you empower to make that value judgement stuff deleted certainly not the only cause mike but people in a local neighborhood should have a voice in what goes on in that neighborhood to deny this is to create another concentrated centralized power to keep the locality from abusing its power in essence using a pit bull to keep a toy poodle from biting your leg chances are the pit bull is going to turn on you some day and you have much less defense against it than you do against the toy poodle the argument here appears to be that tyranny of the individual by the local majority is superior to having the federal government have and exercise the power to protect the individual from his neighbors because that federal government will eventually and inevitably become corrupt and use its power to tyrannize everyone okay there s a lot of truth in that certainly we re seeing something like that happening in the united states today though it s unclear that he progression here matches the model since our beloved and benign federal government hasn t ever shown much enthusiasm for the idea of protecting any individuals lots of people are long on complaints and short on practical solutions although i am pessimistic that my idea will ever bear fruit i am at least trying to be long on solutions also i am truly interested if you have any improvements to make on my ideas i call them my ideas but they all come from an average guy reading of the u s constitution without benefit of the indoctrination of constitutional law academia but i have to say that i think that your solution is at least just as bad trading the yoke of federal tyranny for the yoke of local tyranny doesn t cheer me up much i think i d prefer to put my faith in a larger government that at least might protect the individual from time to time rather than place it in local mob rule admittedly it s the lesser of two evils and it s not less by very much and they re both pretty damn evil sorry the confusion was my fault when i said that fractal federalism resembles the u s constitution i meant it and thought it was pretty clear i should have more clearly explained that the ultimate derivation of government power is from the consensus of the people although not the consent of every individual a practical observation not a moral judgement it is certainly better than having all government power derive from nine lawyers which is the situation we have now that is why i think the supreme court should be a jury court with a different jury for each case it is certainly not perfect no philosophy of government is but do you still find it a repugnant idea if so what is your solution ideally everyone would leave everyone else alone and no government coercive power of any kind would be necessary this will never work because people are different and by their nature they will always want to force their views on others if this were not the case nobody would try to force their view that murder is wrong on anyone else this is true the question is what we you going to do about it your proposed solution seems to actually encourage these bozos to lord it over their victims i think that you misunderstood the structure of the form of government i advocate and it was my fault for not being more clear oh and by the way liborgalism thinking is irrelevant integrity is irrelevant free speech is irrelevant private property is irrelevant personal responsibility is irrelevant conservativism is futile you will be assimilated how much would freedom of speech or private property rights be respected in a community in which the majority was allowed to make all the rules that man s saying things in public that i don t want my children exposed to let s shut him up those homos are living together and fornicating in that house over there let s run em outta town the majority does not make the rules the majority or possibly a plurality simply elects representatives to exercise limited government powers those limited government powers derive from a large consensus not a simple majority and the federal government in my scenario still has the power to protect freedoms william december starr wdstarr athena mit edu matt freivald liborgalism

re waco survivors april in article c sira pew hawnews watson ibm com strom watson ibm com rob strom writes in article c segz mwr dscomsa desy de hallam dscomsa desy de phill hallam baker writes in order to reject the word of the fbi and batf it is neccessary to beleive the words of a man who has just murdered children and ordered the suicide murder of his other followers according to the account given the batf attempted to serve a warrant upon koresh at the ranch and were met by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them the koresh gun supporter claim that the batf started shooting simply does not stand up if the aft had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier grade weaponry than standard issue handguns for all practical purposes they were unarmed the b d followers had automatic weapons the people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire government story this is simply rationalisation it is not enough for them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent that would require them to come up with a solution themselves instead they have to come up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to set out to murder people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them to get gun control legislation through i must object to the characterization of those opposed to the government s handling of the waco situation as gun supporters your argument tries to paint the batf critics as right wing gun nuts and just mixes up two issues i am one of the batf fbi critics and yet i am a liberal and just as anti gun as you are i just happen to believe that everyone has civil rights even religious crazies they re all human beings not some nest of wasps that you re trying to exterminate the batf created the crisis situation by the way they handled the original raid it was well known that koresh regularly went jogging outside his property he could have been served with a search warrant then he could have been arrested if he had refused to comply instead officers armed with grenades invaded the property this escalated into a shooting war with tragic deaths on both sides those were the first two mistakes the bad judgment of asking for a no knock warrant and the bad and probably illegal way the already unwise warrant was served at this point the situation escalated to where it was described as an armed standoff and a hostage crisis that s when the government started covering their traces sealing the warrant revising their reported history of the incident etc things were already building up to disaster now the government could have simply closed the supply routes and waited but according to janet reno that option had never been seriously considered so supposedly because the agents were frustrated and fatigued and because there supposedly were no backups they felt they had to go in yes the govt handled it in the rambo hollywood type style with extreeme machismo perhaps thats not the way to handle it it is a completely different thing to start asserting as many have done that the government is primarily to blame the comparisons with the nazis in particular are purely gratuitous since you have provided a constructive opinion on the issue your post desreves to be taken seriously peter nelson also made some very good points about how a low key approach might have been more effective the point is though that you learn through mistakes the govt played the wrong card and lost thats not a big deal they had had four guys murdered at the begining and maybee they just were not prepared for wuite this situation who could be if the same thing were to happen all over again we might perhaps be able to castigate the govt if they used the same tactics and failed in the same way as it is i can t say that i would not have made the same mistake maybee i wouldn t because i don t as a rule go in for a confrontational situation if i can avoid it maybee i would because with all those press about its very difficult not to try the macho stuff the fbi had information from within the compound we had no access to they may have calculated that the b d followers resolve was cracking based on their listening devices within the compound they knew that koresh had chickened out of one suicide attempt this may have been the reason why they considered that fear might have been a weapon for breaking his resolve again in panama they had used the heavy rock music to great effect during bush s invasion funny that few of the koresh supporters and appologists complain much about the death of several thousand pananmanian civilians while the us govt attempted to arrest their former ally and please let s not turn this into a pro gun vs anti gun discussion anti gun people do not believe that gun owners deserve to get frontally assaulted by armed government agents and koresh s civil rights exist whether his guns were legal illegal illegal but should have been legal or whatever koresh negated his civil rights the minute his followers fired on the police helicopter no matter whether the warrant was or was not technically valid the guys who were carrying it out thought that it

re race and violence in article mvpc rb h d f netcom com mvp netcom com mike van pelt says there is something terribly wrong however with a culture which condemns attacks and all too often kills any of its members who attempt to get an education my mother is an elementary school teacher and she tells me that she and her african american collegues are frustrated to tears by the fact that any african american child who attempts to do well in school and get an education is accused by his her peers of trying to be white and is beaten bullied and tormented by them it goes beyond each passing grade on a test earning a beating in my mother s school one of the most promising young students who happened to be african american had her throat cut by one of these young thugs you know you have a point here but don t stop with african americans when i was in high school in the early s on various occasions i had knives pulled on me had friends who were stabbed and i was beaten up repeatedly by those that couldn t accept me as different and don t let the teachers off the hook either on many many occasions there were teachers that either resented me or were too scared out of their wits by the bullies to even stop the people who attacked me and they would just watch quietly all of this was in a nice white middle class high school in fact we were so nice and white that we made sure that the one black kid in my class was unable to go to the prom with his white girlfriend this isn t a race thing it s the way public schools seem to be run i d hate to be in high school right now at least i didn t have to deal with guns just the roving psycho drug dorks and the jocks without a future but with plenty of testosterone i d separate everyone who wants to learn from these assholes but hey the valuelessness of learning and glorification of jocks is an american tradition you think anything is going to change if you have kids take em out of the public school system and educate them yourself that s what i ll do if i ever have them i wouldn t wish what i went through upon any kid maybe on some of their parents though scott

re good neighbor political hypocrisy test in article apr gordian com mike gordian com michael a thomas writes in article c qk t qk voder nsc com matt galaxy nsc com matt freivald x writes in article apr gordian com mike gordian com michael a thomas writes as far as set the moral tone is concerned if a community does not collectively want to put up with prostitution going on in front of their kids why should they have to if a community does not want to see proliferation of drugs among their kids why should they have to by what right and do tell from the standpoint of the drug dealer or prostitute what is the difference if the gun is pointed by the local hick city council or the feds if something is wrong it is wrong period if it is not sustainable at a federal level why should it be ok just because the geographical unit is smaller peter nelson posted a very eloquent response to this point in talk politics misc so i need not consume more bandwidth here the problem with the egalitarian view is that it tries to deny the fundamental dilemma of democratic government the people have a right to exercise a voice in their community yet individuals have the right to be left to themselves this is a serious dilemma precisely because there is not much that takes place in a vacuum you are seriously misusing the word egalitarian you should look the word up before you use it there is a vast difference between equal justice under the law and egalitarianism what i meant if it was not clear was the intersection set of liberal and libertarian philosophies of natural rights and how the government and constitutional interpretation in particular fits into that philosophy this philosophy engages in the very serious practical error of endowing the nine lawyers on the supreme court with an almost totalitarian authority completely outside of the consent or consensus of the people this is why supreme court nominations are such amazing political fist fights these days because he who controls the court rules the country the people on the court may well be trying to do the best job they can but they are at best a benevolent oligarch even if you approve of every supreme court decision ever eventually an oligarch will arise that will decimate that which you hold dear try supreme court cases by jury and the problem would be mitigated a great deal those who would create broad non enumerated government powers at any level as in european parlamentary democracies and the current de facto standard in the u s have essentially engaged in the same fundamental mistake except that it is some different body that has the totalitarian virtually unchecked except by plurality election death or retirement government power and why should your community be allowed to stop my activities when i m not picking your pocket or defrauding you just because you don t like it because you find it morally repugnant this is like asking why the wind blows unless you can prove that the fact of your engaging in certain activities has absolutely no effect whatsoever on any other human being who has not consented to your engagement in those activities very few human activities indeed fit into this category even for those few that do who would you empower to make the judgement of what is and is not a fully autonomous activity who defines picking my pocket and defrauding are economic assets a person s only assets or are peace of mind stability confidence in a child s emotional environment security and many other things not also a part of a person s assets what gives you the right to create a moral environment that a parent strongly objects to what gives you the right to create an environment of social unrest and instability if you say that what you do does not have those effects by what authority do you say that who is empowered to make these value judgements how would you feel if i got a gang together and found xtianity or insert your favorite cause here morally repugnant and passed laws to outlaw its free exercise all at a local level since that seems to be a ok with you if the federal constitution explicitly prohibited you from doing so the federal government would prevent you from doing so if it did not and you could muster enough local support to pass an amendment to the local constitution by say a majority empowering the local government to do so then i would have to vote with my feet and move to a neighborhood more friendly to my own system of values this is not an ideal situation but it is far better than the mess we are mired in right now as to the gang of pitchfork and torch wielding friends there are very few restrictive local laws that i personally would advocate or vote for since i am of the view that exercising government power over your neighbors should be done with extreme care and only when absolutely necessary but i do believe in protecting children from victimization by people who have callous disregard for the effects they have on others i would certainly leave a well behaved massage parlor alone so long as it had no detrimental effects on the neighborhood you just don t get it the debate is not whether you or a communitity would or would not vote away my rights it is the propriety of whether that should even be an option when you define rights very broadly there is no practical choice about whether people will or will not infringe upon your rights since these rights overlap even when rights are defined very narrowly the government has been empowered to prevent others from infringing on your rights the fundamental question is by whose authority is that power created if you support the current situation with a natural rights supreme court rather than an original understanding supreme court or even better supreme court by jury you are consenting to having nine lawyers in washington d c create those powers out of the air in my fractal federalism scenario it is a broad consensus of the people i e the amendment process that creates those powers certainly not the only cause mike but people in a local neighborhood should have a voice in what goes on in that neighborhood to deny this is to create another concentrated centralized power to keep the locality from abusing its power you mean that horrific centralized power the individual no i mean the federal government that comes trucking in with guns to tell the locals how to run their neighborhood waco tx is a nice example in essence using a pit bull to keep a toy poodle from biting your leg chances are the pit bull is going to turn on you some day and you have much less defense against it than you do against the toy poodle ideally everyone would leave everyone else alone and no government coercive power of any kind would be necessary this will never work because people are different and by their nature they will always want to force their views on others if this were not the case nobody would try to force their view that murder is wrong on anyone else fine when they force their views on others prosecute them until then leave them alone this is such a simple concept how do you feel about speech codes hate speech certainly could be considered an indication that the pit bull is going to turn some day should the community be allowed to limit it too if not why not if you create a community where public masturbation is permitted in the cause of personal autonomy have you done anything different what precisely are these autonomous activities you are referring to if you list them perhaps we can get enough people to agree that they are truly autonomous and pass a constitutional amendment protecting them and how do you feel about david koresh did he deserve it should the batf or a local version of same be allowed to toss him in jail just because they think he s off his rocker the koresh incident appears to be a horrendous abuse of government power power possibly illegitimately obtained through a means i would abolish the constitutionality of no knock warrants seems very dubious to me not to mention the mere existence of batf and the government s propensity to ignore the word infringe in the second amendment this power is upheld by the same body with its incredible concentration of power in the hands of nine people that has upheld much so called civil rights read affirmative action legislation despite the fourteenth amendment who said anything about the public till get rid of it and get out of my face i agree about getting rid of the public till are you still sure you don t want to come over for coffee you might not especially like my neighborhood and i might not especially like yours but at least we can agree to let each other live the kind of life we want to at the point you get rid of the public till you

re eight myths about national health insurance pt ii v pxgt ubvmsb cc buffalo edu daniel b case writes gld cunixb cc columbia edu gary l dare writes i heard about a guy in alberta who came down with some rare eye disease that he had to take repeated trips to seattle to get treated well what american private insurance plans cover travel expenses well it wasn t just the travel expenses it was the whole treatment when you buy insurance where you live it is based on the local rates tourists coming from say utah will find that there is a difference in what their insurance will cover fob provo and what they get stuck with at lenox hill or mount sinai if they fall ill in the big apple but to what extent does it affect the system and why is an urgent care list necessary in the first place it s worth thinking about it s regular practice in a hospital to figure out who needs to get at what facilities don t americans have to arrange in advance for operations too i think that there are two standards being applied here and that canada can t give beverly hills style treatment to everybody it s not a big brother list it s more like calling around town for a table for dinner but americans need far less advance time to book operations it would depend on where you live downtown toronto or mile british columbia just like cheyenne wy vs boston ma again geography rears its ugly head since our health care providers are private they depend on an adequate market size in order to sustain enough business since our health care professionals have equivalent take home pay to their american cousins it s not that they re being paid too little to provide services whether canadians would be thrilled at the prospect of their own health services catering toward americans who would be willing to pay more than they do is another issue entirely it must be noted that they said they were doing it partly because their grants from the province were getting smaller if those grants are so insubstantial why the need to attract foreigners to make up the difference you answered the question yourself private nonprofit foundations have to make money somehow and i think that it s about time that they acted like the private hospitals that they are personally i m fed up with canadian socialists trying to tell everyone that their health care is free when we are actually buying insurance that s one at you bob rae true but i was thinking does can anybody compete with the provinces to offer basic health coverage i remember reading that that sort of private health insurance is actually illegal in canada i have only hear americans say that it s illegal but i could be wrong just have never heard it from a canadian source our private insurance has recently balked in quebec when the liberals proposed privatizing some aspects of routine care also our insurance was put in place when no ndp labour governments were in power in any province to derail the effort cos they wanted real socialized medicine you re not buying insurance so much as being coerced into one insurance plan no it is optional as it is optional for doctors to accept it there are isolated religeous communities in particular that ask for exemptions and one e mail from a christian scientist in edmonton verified for me that it is indeed negative option i guess that you can argue that there is a right to having a particular insurance but so far i ve not come across that up north and i take pains to keep tabs with news from home and that turns the private insurers offering the frills into an effective cartel they don t really need to compete because as you put it they re in a win win situation and they re guaranteed to turn a profit believe me they probably had orgasms when they figured that out and according to my sister the yuppie they pat themselves on the back to the point of ungraciousness at chamber of commerce luncheons interesting side note have any new insurance companies started up from scratch since medicare became standard in canada i actually have doubts that any new ones have emerged since ww i no scratch that there are a few in western canada and quite a few in quebec as part of the post quebec miracle out with the nationalism in with the french capitalism la groupe des cooper antes built a new tower by the eaton s store at les terraces and if you were able to catch urban angel on cbs s crimetime you d see it as the well lit one with double turrets at the top as for ontario which still dominates and anchors business up north canada is a very old money kind of place and the free trade agreement saw a lot of odd alliances labour unions and establishment old money who wanted to preserve their traditional monopolies on one side and entrepreneurs and internationally oriented businesses and professionals on the other the final trudeau administration and the first mulroney government had a high percentage of nouveaux riches who knew what it was like to make your own money and that motivated the mcdonald commission under trudeau which set up brian s initiative macaroni was against free trade til he did a head count of his caucus after the election it s not really insurance if you don t have alternatives well you have to realize that in our society that s like saying that it s not really national defence because you can t hire your own rambo squad instead or even opting out as a pacifist btw there are always pacifists in the news arguing about their portion of taxes but never people arguing over health insurance alternatives and we re talking about a press that is hostile to whomever is in government regardless of party one of their few redeeming characteristics it seems also in the april globe and mail there was a letter from the director of trauma services at st michael s hospital in toronto responding to an article on a study comparing heart surgery in california and canada in which some canadian doctor worried that american analysts would seize on the results as proof that canada rationed vital services the doctor i can t recall his name said that canada is rationing vital services as any physician can plainly see he said that a system in which people are refused treatment because they can t afford it is no different from a system in which people are refused treatment because the government can t afford it as a result of deliberate underfunding of the health insurance plan in fairness he did say that both the us and canadian systems are in the same situation the only way to hit at the canadian system is transient periods of high demand which is more a function of the doctors monopoly s tight fist on the licencing an obvious difference is that in such a transient period the rationing is of the nature of a mob battling over cabbage patch dolls tm as we ve seen recently as opposed by rationing by ability to pay but the former is a transient situation and if a large body of insured patients were to deluge the california health infrastructure the same would result rationing among the insured population with smaller markets there is much less flexibility when dealing with our insured population than california which by the way has rd more people than canada in a much more dense area so he is correct in that the resources are fixed for a particular time window or as a function of the doctors monopoly licencing according to the market steady state in either case as for being refused treatment the government of the day would be shredded to tatters if something like that were to happen canadians can be geographically bad too not realizing that their health care is private while only their insurance isn t too many people have bought into socialist trype that we have socialized medicine i know i know the monopoly power of canadian doctors often leads them to overstate the problems with the system in order to get more money from the government another case of businessmen once scratched becoming socialists right as i ve pointed out above but hasn t that just shifted the locus of the problem from one place to the other it hasn t really solved it either way the transient situations are hard to deal with since the changes in the private medical care resource take place at a slower rate than the ability of people to fall sick esp in the light of disasters e g chernobyl or bad luck a sudden wave of heart disease a doctor needs years of training plus internship and specialty training people too often tend to put prescription cold medicine on their insurance when they really don t need to that s why i ve argued for deductible and copayments rather than education which is what most canadian fiscal conservatives are arguing for the leftists ah just let em spend yeah right also note that only a few provinces cover prescriptions under some high dollar threshold in most it s your private insurance that covers it just like in the u s still it all adds up in the oecd measures in fact buffalo may be the only place in the us where people get don cherry jokes we get the sabres feed as a replacement game on espn tonight the devils local metro ny coverage supplants the main espn game the ndp cleaning up a tory spending mess and just when i thought i understood canadian politics yeah it s a sad story and saskatchewan tory leader grant devine has been on a nonstop pr campaign to save his sorry butt the sask ndp have taken a neo conservative turn like hawke gonzalez and mitterand did has anybody considered following singapore s example and going to a system where the company and the state buys basic and catastrophic coverage for everybody and then you also have an ira sort of thing to which you and your employer can can contribute for medical expenses only it would tend to discourage you from overusing it the medical ira would have limited use as you d need a lower catastrophic threshold else there d still be a drain on the public purse if someone exhausts their ira also singapore has a much more autocratic mentality which has seaped down into its masses if singaporeans that i ve met are any indication i don t mean any disprespect here where they d let you just die one of the good things about being the last country to create a national health care system should we decide to is that we have everybody else s mistakes to learn from that s true the question is how much leeway is there between the u s approach and the second most capitalist approaches of canada france and germany seriously there are few areas that have sufficient population for a two more tiered system like what the french have a health policy prof d g shea has cited studies in the nejm that indicate having a population of is necessary for adequate competition and in canada there are only four cities west of the great lakes with that population or larger but there are many cities in the us with that kind of population yes many and pretty close to a lot of smaller towns or not too far from a bigger town just take a look at a detailed atlas or better take a flight from pittsburgh or rochester to toronto my first time across lake ontario to nyc i was amazed by the increase in density and the toronto region is the densest in all of canada there was one about a group of doctors in calgary who have opened canada s first us style mri clinic as an alternative to the provincially owned one it s about time i ve ragged on my own doctor friends as to why they don t invest in their own private practices in the end it s their money but they choose to spend it on america s cup pipedreams and that s none of my business as for provincially owned for sure it s against the law in canada for governments to be directly involved in the provision of health care except in the military or native reser vations what that term actually means is that the facility gets by on public grants to meet shortfall from lack of use no kidding medical practice itself is much more conservative up north my own best friend did two clerkships at the mayo clinic in rochester mn and is no stranger to high tech medicine but his boat comes first there were some people expressing concern that it was the first wedge of two tiered health care and that it might violate the canada health act no it s probably socialist whiners who are offended that we have private practices and always have they can all take cash anyways so why not have a particular facility the canadian big government mentality often imagines government where it does not even exist since the french and germans have become more entrepreneurial and less laidback without sacrificing their culture and values then canadians can do the same as i ve pointed out above the law states that it is illegal for the government to provide any health services except for the military and natives look nobody stopped the clinic when they planned on the mri nobody stopped them when they bought it nobody seems to be stopping them from using it either much ado about nothing thank goodness that hockey playoffs have started while it seemed currently unjustified there was one anecdote told by the head of the partnership to demonstrate the mri he showed an image of an injured knee which happened to belong to the manager of the bank who approved the loan he said that without it the guy might have had to wait a month or more at the provincial mri then another length of time for treatment after which the muscles would have atrophied and rehabilitation would have been that much harder if that isn t the first whiff of two tiers i don t know what is i m certain there is exaggeration somewhere because the gao study of canada cited often on usenet did not find access to mri to be a problem i ll bet the doctor is relying on people having listened to american trash talk on cable so that he can puff his chest a bit there are already a few treatment regimens for knee injuries without relying on mri

re law and economics i m going to be mixing together here stuff from two of ted frank s articles apr midway uchicago edu which was a response to me and apr midway uchicago edu a response to tim smith yes i know the boomer court didn t call it eminent domain but if it walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks like eminent domain wdstarr are all tort cases really eminent domain cases then what about bankruptcy contract eminent domain is a state mandated transaction in which one party is required to sell a piece of property which it owns to another party regardless of whether the first party wishes to sell at all at a price which is set by the state i fail to see how this doctrine can be found in tort bankruptcy or contract cases in general well okay sort of in bankruptcy if so so what since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from other parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those other parties wdstarr since you said that boomer s reliance on economics led to an unjust result i m pointing out that your alternative is far more unjust in the traditional sense of the world atlantic cement s act was not wrongful it did something that we as a capitalistic society should want them to do build a factory create industry and jobs the cost of compliance was grossly disproportionate to the damage faced by plaintiffs bang here s one of the places where we widely diverge you believe that the courts in deciding a civil dispute between two parties should consider as a factor perhaps as an overriding factor issues which i believe the court should ignore as being irrelevant to the dispute boomer v atlantic cement co was an action brought by one party boomer whose property rights were being violated on an ongoing basis by another party the atlantic cement company the facts supported boomer s contention that atlantic cement was wrongfully damaging his property and boomer asked the court to order atlantic cement to stop doing so end of story there was no reason for the court to consider such issues as what a capitalistic society would want atlantic cement to do or whether the cost of compliance was disproportionate to the damage faced by the plaintiffs those issues had nothing to do with the case before the court bill if the government had stepped in and the epa made a regulation requiring multi million dollar cement plants to be shut down because of a smattering of cement dust at a cost benefit ratio of you d be up in arms why is it okay for the judicial branch to interfere this way but not the legislative or executive branches i d be up in arms why do you assume that quite the contrary i d probably support the action since it would be based on the same general doctrine as the decision that i believe would have been correct in boomer the idea that people s property rights should not be violated for reasons of economic efficiency in boomer it was boomer s property rights which i believe the court should have protected in the hypothetical epa ruling you ve presented it s the american people s collective property rights in a healthy physical environment what good is cost benefit ratio of if you wind up with cement dust in your air your rule makes it per se illegal to ever operate a cement plant if the state of massachusetts came up with a similar regulation you d be up in arms and complaining about interference with property rights and fifth amendment violations once again why is it okay for the judicial branch to interfere this way but not the legislative or executive branches or are you not the libertarian you present yourself as being ted frank how would it be per se illegal to operate a cement plant wouldn t it just mean that when buying land for a cement plant you would have to either buy enough land so that most of the pollution would stay on your land or buy pollution easements from the surrounding landowners tim smith all it takes is one holdout out of hundreds of neighbors to scrap the plant furthermore each of the neighbors is going to want the full benefit of the bargain under the resulting bilateral monopoly a bonanza for lawyers to be sure who get to negotiate each of these agreements a windfall for homeowners who can extort away any profits the plant would make but not particularly good for society yes so what the courts are supposed to protect the specific rights of individuals not the general interests of some nebulous society if society can have its cement plant without violating anyone s rights fine otherwise society will somehow have to limp along with one less cement plant see ted i really am a libertarian after all that s the whole point behind the coase theorem in a world without transactions costs the land will automatically be put to the best use as it is transferred from person to person instantaneously without friction the legal regime will not matter because the result will be the same in a world such as ours one with transactions costs one wants the legal regime to approximate the end result to begin with in order to minimize the transactions costs one wants the legal regime to approximate the end result to begin with in order to minimize the transactions costs which one are you speaking of i want the legal regime to protect people s rights besides coase s theorem only has real application in the never never land of perfectly rational actors in the real world some people are going to be stubborn ornery spiteful or otherwise irrational from a economic point of view and the purpose of the courts is to protect their right to be so i don t care if you can show me logically that your cattle are only doing of damage to my property per head so i should rationally sell you grazing rights to my land for say per head i still retain the right to tell you that i just plain don t want any damned cattle on my property not at any price and then you say everyone s property rights were protected the plaintiffs were made whole unnecessary settlement costs were avoided as above i dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were made whole they were in fact by court action deprived of their rights as owners of property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price acceptable to them wdstarr then by your argument no tort plaintiff is ever made whole because the award of damages in involuntary why should we treat a nuisance plaintiff any different than any other tort plaintiff we don t require specific performance in the analogous contractual situation why in tort last question first for the same reason as in contract law because to do so would come dangerously close to treading on the thirteenth amendment as to your then by your argument no tort plaintiff is ever made whole because the award of damages in involuntary claim you re at least partially right faced with situations in which the wrong has already been done and the damage to the victim has already taken place and cannot be reversed or undone courts will try to set an equitable price tag on the loss suffered by the victim and require the wrongdoer to pay this price rather than an inflated price which the victim might prefer in these cases the sale has already taken place and is irreversible and the court simply tries to ensure that a fair price is paid under the doctrines that a only in certain circumstances should even a civil wrongdoer be forced to pay punitive or excessive prices and b even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified or inequitable manner from his victimhood both of these doctrines may be worth discussing or debating elsewhere but neither is relevant to cases like boomer in which the wrongful act and the loss stemming from it are still in the future and can be reversed undone i e prevented from happening at all by order of the court in these types of cases all the court has to do is require that the potential victim s property rights are protected until and unless he agrees to sell them at a mutually acceptable price there is no need for the court to guess at the equitable value of the loss and force both sides to accept its finding it can leave that operation up to the parties themselves and again i ask since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of ensuring that unnecessary settlement costs are avoided if so i ve been miseducated i always thought that the courts were supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done unnecessary settlement costs are unjust because they are punitive in cases like boomer they re simply a cost of doing business the fact that the proprietors of the atlantic cement co got themselves into a position in which they found themselves over this barrel is simply a result of their own poor business decision to start up a cement plant without first trying to negotiate with boomer and everyone else whose property rights they d be violating via the operation of their plant there s nothing punitive or unjust about it it is completely sensible only if you believe that the alleged right of the owners of atlantic cement to stay in business and avoid losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act and the alleged right of several hundred atlantic cement employees to not have their jobs disappear should trump the rights of people who own property which was damaged by atlantic cement s wrongful acts wdstarr anybody who ever commits a wrongful act should disgorge their entire set of possessions to wronged person weren t you complaining about excess punitive damages before anybody who wants to commit a wrongful act in the future should be required to buy the right to do so from the victim in advance and the seller should be allowed to set his or her price for the privilege no injustice no punitive damages you d like posner bill he s a libertarian really i didn t know that what if anything has he had to say about cases like boomer wdstarr in eal he cites it as an example of bilateral monopoly that the court correctly avoided i m sure its covered in the landes and posner book on tort law presumably favorably but i don t have that book in front of me doesn t sound very much like a libertarian to me libertarians tend to believe in the rights of individual people not societies i ve admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to as law and economics is weak if it advocates the use of economical analysis as one of many tie breaker factors which courts may use to help them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute as measured by the scale of justice is evenly balanced fine but as illustrated by boomer it is not fine when the courts start viewing the economics of a case as being more important than the justice of a case wdstarr in this case the justice of the case was intricately tied up with the economics of the case atlantic cement committed a tort causing k of damage should it pay in the millions or just compensate for the damage it committed as stated above the tort was ongoing atlantic cement wanted to be able to continue to violate boomer s rights while the court may have been justified in setting an equitable price tag on the damage already committed it had no reason and no need to set a price tag on the future violations of boomer s rights and to then force boomer to sell at that price william december starr wdstarr athena mit edu

re can t have it both ways news as enemy news as supporter in article optilink com walsh optilink com mark walsh writes from article qvampinnmhf darkstar ucsc edu by stephen orchid ucsc edu now which is it are you going to comdemn national media then turn around and use it to support some position you present seems somewhat contradictory doesn t it i believe that this is not contradictory on the basis that the quality of media reporting varies greatly based on the subject at hand the media has proven itself very accurate is the areas of presenting raw undisputed data one good example would be the weather page in which high and low temperatures of the previous day for a large number of locations are posting there is little evidence to show that they are in error i believe this true when we speak of physical data in the sense of pure science but when we speak of data that revolve around social sciences then we have to be careful the american media has failed us in its analysis of complex events however i m sure that we can come up with many news stories that have left us angry because so many facts have been ommitted cases that come to mind are the invasion of panama the war with iraq the disaster in waco the issues surrounding the acceptance of gays into the military the war on drugs and many others i quite agree but these are cases or news events that contain politics social science information sociology etc and at best are reflections of the group that reports them as you have pointed out it is difficult to report that the temperature was degrees when it was degrees and have people believe you the story that you bring to light was regarding the new sex survey while i m sure that due to lazyness some of the data was ommitted from the article i would venture to guess that the data that was presented did not deviate from the survey i do however think that it would be folly to have blind faith in a single newswriter s analysis of this data in this particular case there was little analysis and the reader was left to draw his her own convictions yes and no the survey presented according to mr cramer a value called the median which one used this makes us believe that of the males had plus sex partners and of the males had or less sex partners homosexuals are purported to make up only in this case the majority of people with plus sex partners are heterosexual it is my feeling that median was not the intended word usage but if it is then we have little evidence to support mr cramer claims about gay promiscuity hetero promiscuity many netters mr cramer included often forget that the american media are merely a number of businesses who s purpose in life is to make money for their owners and stockholders revenues come largely from advertisers who merely want maximum useful exposure per dollar the media is like fast food the quality of the food or of the reporting will improve only if the customers demand as such otherwise it is business as usual very good this is a point that i have tried to bring out and as any network news program will show you it is true the news media is a business and as such becomes skewed because of where its loyalties lie there is an old statement by a man and i cannot remember him or his statment exactly but it warns against the merger of business and news reporting because of the obvious consequences what master is news going to serve in the end the advertiser and the bias of the news group
drugs and crime a new approach was re if drugs should be legalized wdstarr athena mit edu william december starr writes in article apr msuvx memst edu kebarnes msuvx memst edu said i m for creating a class of noncommercial drugs which would include the currently illegal ones which would be legal to possess grow produce but not to sell bomb the pushers back to the barter age and tax production too um why what s wrong with the act of selling recreational drugs even for mercenary reasons e g getting rich note by selling i mean selling the product to a consenting adult at a mutually agreeable price i point this out in an effort to pre emptively prevent this thread from getting sidetracked onto a flamefest about pushing drugs to schoolchildren or the like and why should the users be subjected to special taxation william december starr note this is a repost of my earlier response to mr starr which was not properly formatted apologies to those who ve seen the following before to explain my position on the war on drugs i offer this drugs and crime a new approach by ken barnes given that the trade in illegal drugs is responsible for much of the crime which afflicts our nation people who want drugs particularly people who are predisposed to addiction will find a way to get them whether or not they are legally available despite current law enforcement efforts drugs are readily available to those who want them addiction to drugs both legal and illegal is responsible for a significant drain on the productive resources of our country and this occurs in a variety of ways from the cocaine addicted babies who are unable to learn to the spread of disease among addicts to the tragic consequences of alcohol abuse and tobacco smoking a general economic principle of government is that whatever is subsidized you get more of and whatever is taxed you get less of to be most effective in confronting the nation s drug problem some way must be found to utilize these additional powers of government to make drug dealing and drug use less attractive while this country s current efforts to combat legal drugs have succeeded in some respects there is a greater awareness of the health consequences of smoking and designated driver programs have helped reduce drunk driving for example the same cannot be said for the war on illegal drugs there remains a core group of illegal drug users which support international networks of smugglers pushers growers processors kingpins and gangsters these networks and their marketing activities which include drive by shootings corrupting law enforcement authorities and smuggling weapons are directly or indirectly responsible for a large proportion of the crimes committed in our country every day clearly illegal drugs and rising crime are linked it takes only a moment s reflection to recognize how they are linked the link is money as with this country s failed effort to prohibit alcohol consumption a black market has been created in which greedy local monopolies like the gangsters of a bygone era have profited enormously from their illegal trade the victims of this trade include not only the innocent people unfortunate enough to be caught in the crossfire but i would argue the drug users themselves were it not for the black market and the violent monopoly of the drug lords drug users might not be the thieves robbers prostitutes and murderers they have become in order to pay the high prices the drug lords demand in the absence of the drug lords most would be i believe simply people with a problem either a moral problem or a medical problem but not a criminal problem let me be clear however i am not advocating that we let the criminals who have been preying on our society for these many years of prohibition off the hook on the contrary the new approach i advocate is one which would not result in either the government or private industry getting into the business of promoting crack cocaine or any other presently illegal drug for that matter neither is it an approach which sees law abiding citizens handing over more and more of their freedom and privacy in an effort to track down illegal drug users until the land of the free and the home of the brave looks like a police state here then is my proposal possession and use of all presently illegal drugs is decriminalized but buying and selling them remains illegal potheads can grow their own marijuana as many already do today other drug users can legally import their poison of choice as long as they pay the tariffs and a barter economy of drug experimenters develops because of the barter economy which supplies the drug users the black market profits that have so enriched the drug lords dwindle if these drugs can be obtained for free or next to nothing why buy them nevertheless there will be those who will seek to sell these noncommercial drugs even at relatively low prices therefore law enforcement activity is concentrated on those individuals who continue to buy and sell and also on the crimes committed by drug users too poor to afford even low prices but here is where the strategy begins to differentiate between the drug dealers the victimizers and the drug users their victims upon arrest for any crime suspects are permitted to choose whether or not they will undergo a drug test those who choose to cooperate are informed that upon conviction for the crime they are accused of if they are found to be a drug user they will be institutionalized until they are clean and only then will they begin to serve their sentence if they choose to cooperate and are already drug free they can begin to serve their sentence right away those who choose not to undergo the drug test and are convicted face stiffer fines and serve longer sentences institutionalization of drug using criminals serves several purposes drug using criminals and this includes drunk and or stoned drivers are separated from their sources of supply thus reducing the total number of drug users in society at large and consequently decreasing the demand for drugs on the street putting more of the remaining drug dealers out of business institutionalization provides an incentive for drug using criminals to straighten themselves out before becoming part of the general prison population while helping protect society from crime institutionalization could also serve to deter drug users from becoming criminals since drug using criminals unlike other criminals would be delayed prior to serving their sentences by the additional time it takes for them to sober up institutionalization of drug using criminals separate from the general prison population would also provide a closely monitored pool of addicts who could volunteer for research studies of new techniques and treatments for addictive disease with the potential to benefit both themselves and others dealers in illegal drugs are generally not drug users themselves and this is particularly true of the drug bosses or kingpins running large illicit organizations under this proposal dealers would be more readily identifiable since upon arrest they would presumably pass the drug test or else decline to take it in order to avoid having to explain why they are in possession of drugs when it is apparent they do not use them declining to take the test they would of course face stiffer penalties while each case of attempted sale of a noncommercial drug would have to stand on own its merits the outcome of a suspect s drug test could provide additional evidence for the prosecution just as cigarette taxes have contributed to the decline of smoking in our country by making cigarettes more costly while at the same time providing revenue for anti smoking campaigns noncommercial drugs should be taxed and the money generated should be used to combat their use enforcement of this tax should be on a voluntary basis however and should not be used as an excuse to infringe on the rights and privacy of noncommercial drug users since to do so would have the effect of reintroducing prohibition instead drug users will be encouraged to pay the tax by reminding them that if untaxed drugs are ever found in their possession during the course of routine police operations they will be required to pay the tax immediately or else forfeit their untaxed drugs to be destroyed if drug dealers are found to be selling noncommercial drugs on which taxes have not been paid they will face additional prosecution for evading the tax the strategy of adding tax evasion to drug dealing charges is already in use in some jurisdictions but its effectiveness is currently limited by the illegality of drug possession revenue from drug possession taxes and import tariffs would be used to fund anti drug advertising campaigns and provide support to private sector drug treatment programs for those unable to afford treatment taxpayer subsidies to all drug producers must be ended federal support of tobacco farming is both immoral and wasteful in this era of tight budgets and the marijuana crops grown illicitly on federal lands in many states must likewise be eliminated while my proposal would have the effect of permitting the use of what are now illegal drugs it would hold the users of all drugs responsible for their actions and i believe would reduce the harm drugs have on our society particularly the crime caused by the illegal drug trade so long as we remain a free nation with relatively porous borders and freedom for our citizens to travel we will always have a drug problem whether it takes the form of heroin addicts dying in abandoned buildings drunk drivers killing and maiming others on our streets or emphysema patients struggling for breath after a lifetime of smoking the results are the same needless suffering and death as a society we must recognize that while our society permits us to harm ourselves with drugs as we are already doing regardless of the drug laws we must take a stand against the harm that drugs and drug users cause to others we must particularly oppose the vicious and violent cartels which prey on the weakness of drug users by taking the profits out of their deadly trade my proposal goes a long way towards shutting down these powerful criminal organizations the question of whether drug use is a moral or medical problem depends on which group of drug users you re talking about different drugs have different effects and some are more addictive than others the addictiveness of a drug also often varies between individuals and so we have some people who can drink alcohol in moderation while others find they cannot resist the bottle nicotine which former surgeon general c everett koop declared to be as addicting as heroin is a legal drug with known harmful effects and while some people can stop smoking by willpower alone others continue to smoke even after treatment for lung cancer for those individuals who can stop taking drugs on their own we may argue that because they have chosen to use them this represents a moral failure on their part or an unwillingness to face the difficulties of life but for the addicts while they may have chosen to use drugs the first time by the time they discover their addiction it is too late we cannot hold them responsible for their disease any more than we would blame someone who is drowning for an inability to swim perhaps they should have known not to go near the water or perhaps someone should have warned them of the danger but in their present circumstances warnings will not help neither does it help for the drug dealers on the shore to be tossing them weights standard disclaimer x dna ken barnes lifesci bldg

re eight myths about national health insurance pt ii in article apr news columbia edu gld cunixb cc columbia edu gary l dare writes v pxgt ubvmsb cc buffalo edu daniel b case writes also in the april globe and mail there was a letter from the director of trauma services at st michael s hospital in toronto responding to an article on a study comparing heart surgery in california and canada in which some canadian doctor worried that that study which was in the nejm i think noted that the frequency of heart surgery on patients over seventy increase with income in california i guess richer people have more heart disease in california whereas the frequency of surgery on patients over seventy in canada was relatively uniform across income distribution heart surgery was more frequent in california but mortality and outcomes were essentially the same american analysts would seize on the results as proof that canada rationed vital services the doctor i can t recall his name said that canada is rationing vital services as any physician can plainly see he said that a system in which people are refused treatment because they can t afford it is no different from a system in which people are refused treatment because the government can t afford it as a result of deliberate underfunding of the health insurance plan in fairness he did say that both the us and canadian systems are in the same situation the ndp cleaning up a tory spending mess and just when i thought i understood canadian politics there was one about a group of doctors in calgary who have opened canada s first us style mri clinic as an alternative to the provincially owned one it s about time i ve ragged on my own doctor friends as to why they don t invest in their own private practices in the end it s their money but they choose to spend it on america s cup pipedreams and that s none of my business as for provincially owned for sure it s against the law in canada for governments to be directly involved in the provision of health care except in the military or native reser vations what that term actually means is that the facility gets by on public grants to meet shortfall from lack of use no kidding medical practice itself is much more conservative up north my own best friend did two clerkships at the mayo clinic in rochester mn and is no stranger to high tech medicine but his boat comes first there were some people expressing concern that it was the first wedge of two tiered health care and that it might violate the canada health act no it s probably socialist whiners who are offended that we have private practices and always have they can all take cash anyways so why not have a particular facility the canadian big government mentality often imagines government where it does not even exist the only potential problem i see with the private mri facilty in calgary is the self referral problem to the facility for the doctors who have a financial interest in it which is basically unethical but in canada because of our small population there is likely only to be a few private facilities involving only a small number of doctors and thus i don t think the self referral problem which is an epidemic in the us could ever get out of hand here look nobody stopped the clinic when they planned on the mri nobody stopped them when they bought it nobody seems to be stopping them from using it either much ado about nothing thank goodness that hockey playoffs have started it is an experiment that will be certainly be watched carefully while it seemed currently unjustified there was one anecdote told by the head of the partnership to demonstrate the mri he showed an image of an injured knee which happened to belong to the manager of the bank who approved the loan he said that without it the guy might have had to wait a month or more at the provincial mri then another length of time for treatment after which the muscles would have atrophied and rehabilitation would have been that much harder if that isn t the first whiff of two tiers i don t know what is i m certain there is exaggeration somewhere because the gao study of canada cited often on usenet did not find access to mri to be a problem i ll bet the doctor is relying on people having listened to american trash talk on cable so that he can puff his chest a bit there are already a few treatment regimens for knee injuries without relying on mri unfortunately i ve had a few and i m not a banker what likely happened is the sponsors of the private mri which include doctors anticipated that alberta would need more mri s and instead of waiting for the health planners to realize they needed another one or two saw a business opportunity where they would have a secure business from the public insurance side of things and they could supplement people and businesses who want to pay cash gerald

re are americans sexually repressed in article apr a cs okstate edu kennejs a cs okstate edu kennedy james scot writes recent studies have shown that the number of men who have engaged in homosexual activities in the last decade is and the number of men who are exclusively homosexual is these figures are much less than those that came from earlier studies that showed that homosexuality among men is a lot higher so what can we deduce from these figures are there a lot less male homosexuals than there used to be or are men perhaps women too not as honest as they used to be about there sexuality presumably the people that were polled in you mean in the s men and women were much more open about their homosexuality than today want to try that one again this survey were assured of their anonymnity so they should have answered the questions honestly i suppose however it could be that gays feel so repressed and denigrated by society that they didn t feel that they could be forthcoming about there sexuality in something like a survey if this true then is it possible that there is a lot more gays out there than we are led to believe perhaps if americans were more open about there sexuality i think most americans aren t then we might discover that there are really quite a few more people out there who are orientated toward the same sex men and women included i d venture a guess that there is a lot of people out there who have considered having a relationship with someone of the same sex at some point in there life maybe they didn t take their longings seriously but this doesn t make these longings any less valid therefore if americans weren t so repressed about their sexuality in general as i believe they may be then we d see a lot more people coming out of the closet you mean ignore study after study so that we can continue to accept a study kinsey s that is obviously wrong as for myself i m a heterosexual and i ve never considered having sex with another man that s just the way i am i could have just as easily of been gay i suppose one of the big debates about homosexuality is whether or not it s a type of behavior that is learned or if one is just born that way imho the more likely explanation is that it s some combination of the two based on what besides your own warm fuzzy feelings here s something to ponder upon have any of you gay bashers out there ever considered that homosexuals probably deem their sexual orientation as being a state of affairs that is just as much an intrinsic and natural part of their life as heterosexuals do about their own sexuality in other words someone who is truly alcoholics share that feeling until they hit bottom gay may not be able to live any other way even if they date someone of the opposite sex or get married in their heart they are still a homosexual likewise if someone who is truly heterosexual forms a relationship with someone of the same sex then they are still a heterosexual even though outward appearances may suggest otherwise scott kennedy brewer and patriot unless of course the problem is that homosexuality is a form of mental disorder caused by childhood sexual abuse as a number of recent works suggest if homosexuals would stop using the government to impose their morality on others antidiscrimination laws and leave our children alone i wouldn t care in the least what they did in private but until they get over the liberal notion that the proper role of government is to tell peaceful people how to live i have no choice but to continue to point out that homosexuality is not an alternative lifestyle but a sickness before david koresh is a cheap thug who interprets the bible through the barrel of a gun atf spokesman after the atf is a cheap thug who interprets the constitution through the barrel of a gun me good signature clayton e cramer uunet pyramid optilink cramer my opinions all mine relations between people to be by mutual consent or not at all

to property ownership i just think property ownership should be limited to what an individual person family needs i do not need acres to survive i need about acres at most and could get by on less i argue that by having all property tied up and thus cutting people off form the basic level of subsistance that the property owners must bribe the rest of us to respect their ownership rights by providing alternative means of subsistance when we are expected to give these peoperty owners lets call them thieves bribes in order to be able to subsists then we have a sick situation the property owners are then parasites i want people to be able to live happy and prosperous lives property owners cannot maintain a monopoly in the free enterprise system unless they have help from a coercive government when a few land owners get together and try to control all the land without selling land prices will go up at some point it will be to the advantage of the land owner to sell some of his property trying to put a group of people to distribute land fairly would give them monopoly control over the land and would have the consequences you speak of let s keep the land out of the grasp of a monopoly and let it exist in the free market it s already in the hands of a monopoly of the rich because of capitalism of land other than government land saved for posterity and the eco system as well as government function the remaining land is owned by a smaller percentage of the people than ever before the game of capitalism is almost won the game has only to be declared over and we will have to take matters into our own hands and redistribute it again fairly or else be enslaved in return for a place to live here in central california already fewer than own all the property and of them own of it that s twice what it was twenty years ago rents are so high that you pay of your income for rent if you just have a mcjob all you can afford is one room if that some of minimum wage workers are homeless unless you both have degrees in technical fields and are working in them in the midst of unemployment in high tech jobs you will never own anything but a used car if you choose to have more than one child and everywhere else you could afford there are no jobs the only way to get there is to save and not consume any more than you have to clothing used food poor no movies no entertainment ect for about five to seven years and then if you ve saved if you can get together that much and that s ignoring your kids and working two jobs then you can buy a home in arkansas or missouri outright and live somewhere where they flood every other year that s an exaggeration if you pay close attention to the flood lines on other people s houses and find a sturdy hill then you can buy one up there also buy a rowboat missouri s not so bad if you like the sensation of sleeping in a sweatbox in summer and your car freezing solid in winter they really do put those heaters into the dipstick hole to keep them warm enough to start with ether shit kill the rich and redistribute the livable property kill all of them rsw i want people to be able to work and gain a basic subsistance and more is there a workable system for what you suggest i am always looking for improvements on the way we can coexist in this world and will give people happy meaningful lives where each individual can reach their highest potential are you asking for the forced redistribution of land any system i imagine will lead to unfairnes pollution over popullation and land mismanagement if you know of such a system please describe it please be specific since my imagination cannot comprehend such a system specifics that i am interested in does someone get land assigned them when they are born what happens to someone s land when they die can they pass it on to their children can someone sell land can someone leaase their land what governmental restrictions will be put on land use who will administer such a system

what you are proposing if you can answer these quesitons paul schmidt advocates for self government davy crockett chapter president the land is simply granted to people who live on it now extra is kept for the future you get to stay where you are without paying rent land that supports others becomes property of the state farmers are welcome to plant crops that people need according to demand and ability and soil quality if you want to grow sourgum because you always did and you aren t doing a good job then we let another farmer grow sorghum and you grow something else when people die the land they were entitled to use goes into the public holdings no one can sell land but they can trade places with anybody no one can lease land the government will locally distribute the use of the land not used for residences residences that are insufficient to the families living there can be traded to the public for a larger house and yard according to need and availability the local land council who vow to live on their land till death to avoid profit ties will decide fairness subject to review by the state and federal land councils it will cost no more than any fucking thing costs

proposed this theory months ago let s take it one step further even if as the surveys show up to of all men have had a homosexual encounter then there must cite a survey other than the obviously bogus kinsey studies granted pomeroy bell weinberg national institute of mental health paper patterns of adjusment in deviant populations cited as part of the national institute of mental health task force on homosexuality pomery concluded the kinsey statistic of is probably higher than is realistic according to these estimates is a more realistic figure i went out and bought lots of bell weinberg this weekend can you tell also the janus report on sexual behavior samuel s janus ph d and cynthia l janus m d john wiley sons pub has the following table have you ever had a homosexual experience men women n yes no table how often have you had homosexual contact men women n a once b occasionally c frequently d ongoing active c d of is this number is consistent with kinsey pomery gebard bell weinberg and rice in the finding that of the male population is actively homosexual with an further breakdown bell wienberg of exclusively so and self identifying themselves as bisexuals pp as for debunking kinsey the following article is an important lesson for everyone to read was kinsey a fake and a pervert by philip nobile far out on the grassy knoll of sexology there is a cult of prochastity researchers who claim that the late alfred kinsey was a secret sex criminal a hoosier dr mengele who bent his numbers toward the bisexual and the bizarre in a grand conspiracy to queer the nation and usher in an era of free sex with kids but what really riles these critics is kinsey s towerin cultural influence his bestselling surveys sexual behavior in the human male and sexual behavior in the human female tore the sheets off the country s erogenous zones and undermined midcentury morals his charts and graphs based on detailed histories of men and women demonstrated that practices generally considered rare and or abnormal masturbation extramarital relations homosexuality and even barnyard bestiality were as american as strawberry shortcake yet for a hard core of these heterosexual supremacists aided and abetted by pat buchanan and the religious right the zoology professor from indiana university remains the evil genius behind the sex revolution and a target for character assassination judith reisman the prosecution s expert witness at the mapplethorpe trial in cincinnati is the leader of the anti kinsey revisionists as well as his inspector javert in during a radio interview with pat buchanan in washington reisman accused kinsey of having been inolved in the vicious genital torture of hundreds of children she speculated that he kidnapped and drugged ghetto boys in order to carry out clandestine orgasm tests now seven years later reisman has revived her charges in a different book titled kinsey sex and fraud just released by the small and religiously oriented huntington house in lafayette louisiana her coauthor is ed eichel a manhattan psychotherapist who has invented a new style of intromission the coital alignment technique that supposedly triggers simultaneous orgasm with considerable regularity and thereby increases compatibilty between the sexes in the book eichel contends that kinsey deliberately cooked the gay stats because being an oddball himself he wanted to advance the denormalization of heterosexuality if the authors are right then the world famous kinsey reports are as the introduction boldly asserts the most egregious example of scientific deception in this century and if they are wrong kinsey sex and fraud is a shameful smear despite the less than stellar credentials of kinsey s detractors legends are not what they used to be martin luther king may have committed plagiarism bruno bettelheim slapped young mental patients around father bruce ritter the founder of covenant house preyed on runaway boys closer to kinsey masters and johnson have been disgraced for faking it in one way or another so it should not surprise anybody that kinsey who filmed strange people having sex in his attic may have had skeletons in the closet the problem is that reisman does not seem to have the intellectual prowess to pull off the job as a thinker the woman is no madame curie the year old former songwriter for captain kangaroo has little professional standing no current university position and no peer review publications though her creative resume was padded with phantom accomplishments for instance it listed a book as her own take back the night women on pornography that was actually written and edited by others then there is her ph d in speech communication from cleveland s case western reserve university although reisman has no bachelor s degree case granted her a master s in and a doctorate in her dissertation was on the commentaries of a local octagenarian tv commentator but on the resume reisman gave this piece of scholarship a fancy hautes etudes moniker to wit the application of aristotelian and systems analytic theory to mass media effects when reisman burst into prominence on buchanan s program it was love at first sight for al regnery the outwardly anti porn head of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention in ed meese s justice department regnery was a young law and order conservative and amateur social philosopher who wanted to help change the sexual climate of the united states after reisman s sensational radio session the sexual equivalent of joe mccarthy s wheeling speech regnery summoned her to meetings to discuss mutual interests first he tried to shovel her for a quasi frankenstein study that was going to measure the brain chemicals of men and boys who looked at arousing photographs guffaws on capitol hill killed the original proposal but in govemment money went to reisman anyway for plan b a probe of child images in the cartoons playboy penthouse and hust ler incredibly this grant surpassed the entire budget of the attorney general s pornography commission when the overpriced and oversold project was completed in it was immediately shelved by an embarrassed justice department that spring regnery resigned from his post only days before the new republic carried this admission that he had kept porno magazines around the house notwithstanding the six figure humiliation reisman went on to scratch out a niche on the ioony right as the darling of the sex cranks she deplores subversive phenomena like shaved genitalia in men s magazines and blames aids on gays kinsey sex and fraud is reisman s latest grasp for respectability pat buchanan of course is putting his krugerrands on reisman s ultimate vindication this book is social dynamite he says in a blurb an the front cover he especially liked the antigay parts smacking his lips in his syndicated column he declared it may just blow the sewer cap off kinsey s monumental reputation reestablish homosexuality as a in aberration expose the gay rights movement as a paper tiger and even put at risk the enormous sex industry built upon dr kinsey s research the blockbuster charge at the heart of the cluttered and repetilive j accuse is that kinsey was a sex mad pedophile who molested little boys in nazi type experiments and recorded their orgasms in his male volume a similar charge was first recited at the fifth world conference on sexology in jerusalem in to no effect before being recycled by reisman for buchanan in washington in here is how reisman and eichel repackaged the mengele business in kinsey sex and fraud mengele like scientific experiments on infants and children were the basis for kinsey s conclusions on childhood sexuality somewhere and sometime in the course of the project kinsey appears to have directed experimental sex research on several hundred children aged from two months to almost years this of course would implicate kinsey and his team in promoting and perhaps participating in the criminal activity in the opinion of this book s authors that is exactly how part of kinsey s child sexuality research took place donning his psychohistorian s cap and citing an fbi manual on child molesters as a guide eichel casually diagnoses kinsey as a homosexual pedophile with the perfect motive for doing exactly as reisman said kinsey placed himself in professional and nonprofessional positions where he had access to young boys such as y m c a camp counselor boys club leader and boy scout leader activities he kept up during his college and graduate yeaers and even after his marriage as crude as his analysis seems eichel was more than happy to elaborate even further in a recent phone interview if you ve ever been around boy lovers pedophiles they are absolutely compulsive he averred everything in his life is directed at getting children i didn t mention this in our book but the caption under kinsey s high school picture was a quote from hamlet man delights me not no sic nor woman neither what do you think they were picking up on before weighing what reisman and eichel pass off as proof of kinsey s sex crimes something must be said about kinsey s scientific modus operandi he was a fiendish collector as a young zoologist with a d sc from harvard he collected million gall wasps and million related insects when he switched to sex exploration after agreeing to teach a marriage course at indiana university in he was no less curious or acquisitive nothing that mammals did in the realm of reproduction was foreign to him he compiled masses of erotic materials including toilet wall inscriptions from male and female johns that highlighted differences in sexual psychology and flms of mating in species of animals that showed an amazing similarity in oral eroticism naturally the sexual response of children the genesis of eros fascinated him it was impossible to understand the sexual behaviors of adults without examining their origins and so with the fervor of his bughunting days kinsey collected information about kids though even his worst enemies until reisman and eichel refrained from linking him personally to his data on preadolescent sex kinsey said plainly in the male volume that he got information on the sex life of young boys from people who had sex with them some of these adults are technically trained persons who have kept diaries or other records which have been put at our disposal although he gathered much boyhood data from the memories of his subjects and the observations of parents and nursery school teachers he treated the documentary materia of the pedophiles as pure gold there was nothing like it in the literature kinsey s main source a year old govemment worker was also the most unforgettable character he had ever met this man whose history took hours to log had sex with over boys and girls as well as of family members including his father and grandmother a sexual hobbyist and passionate record keeper he gave kinsey detailed accounts of orgasms that he observed in preadolescent boys relying on the man s meticulous research which involved following some boys for as long as years kinsey was able to identify for the first time six distinct types of male orgasm some of which involved violent contortions at the peak of release as well as the speed and the capacity of climax what freud had only imagined about childhood sexuality kinsey had reported as fact children were indeed erotic beings from the cradle these data on the sexual activities of younger male provide an important substantiation of the freudian view of sexuality as a component that is present in the human animal from earliest infancy he concluded without raising eyebrows in then along came judith reisman ignorng the legitimacy of kinsey s inquiry she beheld the ghost of mengele in bloomington she was appalled by the thought of infant ecstasy and read torture in the portrayals of prepubertal orgasm rendered by the government worker and she dared to say that kinsey was a sex criminal well was he or wasn t he let s go to the text there is no evidence in kinsey sex and fraud no witnesses no paper noteven a trace of hearsay that implicates kinsey in either planning or partaking in child sex experiments after years on the trail reisman has uncovered just two sources to back up her original charge amazingly enough kinsey himself and wardell pomeroy kinsey s coauthor on both reports to whom reisman has never spoken it turns out that her whole case rests on a few passages in the male volume iand in pomeroy s biography titled dr kinsey and the institute for sex research after frisking every the and and in both books reisman came up with what she believes are smoking sentences to establish kinsey s alleged role in the planning she says that there is a hint in the fifth chapter of the male volume that kinsey directed the orgasm studies on kids she cites his tell tale quote from a critic of armchair psychoanalysis demanding that writers test their theories by empirical study and statistical procedures then she combines this quote with kinsey s statement that some of the observations of his pedophile sources were continued over periods of months or years until the individuals were old enough to make it certain that true orgasm was involved putting two and two together kinsey s empiricism and lengthy experimentation she arrives at her hint but realizing this dog would not hunt she devoted but a single paragraph to kinsey s supposed planning before shifting to the issue of his personal involvement as for the alleged participation after poring over pomeroy s biography reisman found several hidden clues suggesting kinsey s likely hands on approach to kiddie sex here the chain of reasoning is more complex she points out that kinsey was interested in clitoral measurements collecting sperm and filming sex in his attic since kinsey did indeed mislead indiana university about the purpose of his cinematography he said that he was filming animal sex reisman asserts that a similar misrepresentation may yet apply to kinsey s child sex experiments catch the may reisman was also struck by kinsey s doubting thomas attitude toward the never before recorded climax of female rabbits kinsey according to pomeroy was the type of person who needed to see things for himself pomeroy gave the example of orgasm in the female rabbit because he had not personally witnessed this event kinsey had difficulty in accepting its reality even on the strength of testimony from a distinguished scientist how then did kinsey testify to the actuality of orgasm in a month old infant from the mere history of a sex offender but of course he did not he depended on their records from this fantastic alchemy of conjecture mixed with clitorides sperm attic cumshots and climax in cottontail has reisman defamed the legendary kinsey paul gebhard succeeded kinsey as the director of the kinsey institute and now lives in retirement outside bloomington reached by telephone gebhard defended the pedophile connection and denied reisman s nasty imputations i don t understand the resistance of people like reisman to studying the sexuality of children gebhard said more in exasperation than anger that is where sex begins we were happy to take data wherever we found it even though pedophiles commit criminal acts they are usually not violent folks they wouldn t be very successful if they were one of our best sources was a headmaster of a boys school who maintained a kind of alumni club and sometimes went to the weddings of his former students as for directing experiments that s absurd we never told any of our subjects what to do lt was against our principles almost all of the pedophile material was retrospective anyway nor did we ever conduct sex experiments with children ourselves that would have been highly inappropriate i asked gebhard if kinsey had ever seen a child in a sexual situation i think a mother once brought in a little girl who humped her teddy bear and kinsey watched it as for kinsey s sex life it is still shrouded in confidentiality he was married to the same woman for years and fathered four children apparently there are no huge sexual revelations although rumors of homosexuality have persisted without confirmation through the years gebhard took his boss s history back in the s but he refuses to discuss what he knows we never divulge anything about anybody s history whether dead or alive he says reisman said no to an interview for this article on the grounds that i had once worked for penthouse not to mention the fact that we have been debating each other in various forums for the past five years in keeping with our contentious history she took a swipe at me in her book for continuing the kinsey practice of euphemizing incest my offense was using the biblical variant lying with a near relative in a article on the subject of incest as a synonym for intercourse lying with appears eight times in genesis ed eichel is a different story though seemingly obsessed by kinsey like his coauthor he was friendly in long conversations he told me that he began to smell a big baised agenda in sexology when he was a student in new york university s human sexuality program in the early s it was literally a gay studies program for heterosexuals he says around eichel came upon reisman s critique of kinsey and the conspiracy theory started to sink in the sex establishment was ruled by a kinseyan bisexual bund advocating the overthrow of the heterosexual norm no wonder he was having such a rough time promoting the joy of simultaneous orgasm anything that enhanced sexual compatibility between men and women inevitably raised objections eventually eichel exchanged philosophical fluids with reisman and from this union kinsey sex and fraud was born eichel s main contribution to the book is discovery and analysis of a kinsey conspiracy that supposedly seeks the establishment of bisexuality as the balanced sexual orientation for normal uninhibited people which by destroying the traditional family structure and normal sexual behavior would open the way for the second and more difficult step the ultimate goal of cross generational sex sex with children when i pressed him for specific references to back up his outrageous contentions he said weakly you don t think kinsey is going to come right out and say that everybody is basically bisexual and should have sex with kids but this is implicit in the kinsey reports meanwhile eichel is demanding a congressional investigation of kinsey and his data perfect that s just what the country needs a house un american sexual

that particular monday was was december the first day of the bill of rights third century the day when federal agents and local law enforcement officer broke into the house in tulsa that always flew the u s flag when lawmaster drove into the driveway that bleak afternoon one of his neighbors had some news ohmigod john you are in big trouble my neighbor tells me sixty police federal agents and the bomb squad busted in you house kicked down the door cut locks off your gun safe i couldn t believe it then i walked inside what a nightmare it was no nightmare it was horribly real life apparently acting on information the lawmaster possessed an illegal firearm some thirty agents of the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms batf teamed up with state and tulsa police authorities search warrant in hand to search for a colt ar caliber machine gun unknown serial number the warrant issued by u s magistrate john leo wagner also authorized agents to seize any tools used in the alteration or modification of firearms such as files or drills documents papers books records and other tangible properties which identify occupants or owners of the property to be searched reports vary but according to neighbors the joint task force operation aimed at the unemployed warehouseman from a nearby hospital involved some agents and local law enforcement personnel against lawmaster they cordoned off the street took station with weapons drawn in the back yard used a battering ram to break through the front door kicked in the back door broke into his gun safe threw personal papers around the house spilled boxes of ammunition on the floor broke into a small locked box that contained precious coins stood on a table to peer through the ceiling tiles breaking the table in the process then they left the doors were closed but not latched much less locked the ammo and guns were left unsecured my front and back doors were pulled shut but they were busted through and couldn t latch anybody could have waltzed in there and stolen everything i own a child could have taken a gun the guns the safe everything was open and laying around i keep all my magazines empty but someone had loaded them while i was looking around in amazement the gas electric and water companies show up to turn the power off they said they were told to shut things down then i found the note nothing found atf they didn t make any attempt to notify me i ve lived in tulsa all my life and never got more than a traffic ticket how come they can t look that up realize i ve been law abiding my whole life then come to the door when i m home they didn t leave someone here to watch over my private property they didn t even come by to explain what happened they just raided my home ransaked it left it wide open and left lawmaster placed a phone call to the local batf agent i asked are you gonna arrest me and he said no i asken him who is going to repair and clean up my house and he said if you re going to talk to me come down to my office i can t come down i said my doors are broken if i had been on vacation and i didn t have friendly neighbors i would have lost everything i own here i am a competent responsible firearms owner and the government leaves them open unlocked with ammo strewn around lawmaster said the agent advised him if you want your door to lock and your gun safe to lock

clinton remarks by the president on waco w q a the white house office of the press secretary for immediate release april remarks by the president in question and answer session with the press the rose garden p m edt the president on february the th four federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the branch davidian compound which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition and placed innocent children at risk because the batf operation had failed to meet its objective a day standoff ensued the federal bureau of investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life the bureau s efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing david koresh was dangerous irrational and probably insane he engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency he was moreover responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in february given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound this weekend i was briefed by attorney general reno on an operation prepared by the fbi designed to increase pressure on koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully the plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition even in the face of fire and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health but would it was hoped force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender i was informed of the plan to end the siege i discussed it with attorney general reno i asked the questions i thought it was appropriate for me to ask i then told her to do what she thought was right and i take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision yesterday s action ended in a horrible human tragedy mr koresh s response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive he killed those he controlled and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued now we must review the past with an eye towards the future i have directed the united stated departments of justice and treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why and whether anything could have been done differently i have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation i expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review finally i have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the american people i want to express my appreciation to the attorney general to the justice department and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances again i want to say as i did yesterday i am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in waco i hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like david koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks and i hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now q mr president can you first of all tell us why after days you decided q mr president can you describe for us what it is that janet reno outlined to you in your minute phone conversation with the president i can t hear you both if one will go first and then the other q sorry can you describe what janet reno q mr president the president i ll answer both your questions but i can t do it at once q can you describe what she told you on sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it the president yes i was told by the attorney general that the fbi strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound and she described generally what the operation would be that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building and it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside i was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon they were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire in fact as you know an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials there were no shots coming back from the government side i asked a number of questions the first question i asked is why now we have waited seven weeks why now the reasons i was given were the following number one that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there they might be needed in other parts of the country number two that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting koresh and the other cult members to come out number three that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase not decrease with the passage of time and number four that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions so for those reasons they wanted to move at that time the second question i asked the attorney general is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good she said that the fbi personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time the third question i asked was has the military been consulted as soon as the initial tragedy came to light in waco that s the first thing i asked to be done because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation military people were then brought in helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it and so i asked if the military had been consulted the attorney general said that they had and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the fbi and the military something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance having asked those questions and gotten those answers i said that if she thought it was the right thing to do that she should proceed and that i would support it and i stand by that today q mr president the president wait go ahead q can you address the widespread perception reported widely television radio and newspapers that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster the president no i m bewildered by it the only reason i made no public statement yesterday let me say the only reason i made no public statement yesterday is that i had nothing to add to what was being said and i literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody it was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold there was i have i can t account for why people speculated one way or the other but i talked to the attorney general on the day before the action took place i talked to her yesterday i called her again late last night after she appeared on the larry king show and i talked to her again this morning a president it is not possible for a president to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control i will say this however i was frankly surprised would be a mild word to say that anyone that would suggest that the attorney general should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves applause i regret what happened but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance these people killed four federal officials in the line of duty they were heavily armed they fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly and they were never fired back on we did everything we could to avoid the loss of life they made the decision to immolate themselves and i regret it terribly and i feel awful about the children but in the end the last comment i had from janet reno is when and i talked to her on sunday i said now i want you to tell me once more why you believe not why they believe why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more and she said it s because of the children they have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they re in increasingly unsafe conditions and that they don t think it will get any easier with time with the passage of time i have to take their word for that so that is where i think things stand q can we assume then that you don t think this was mishandled in view of the outcome that you didn t run out of patience and if you had it to do over again would you really decide that way the president no well i think what you can assume is just exactly what i announced today this is a the fbi has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time this is the same fbi that found the people that bombed the world trade center in lickety split record time we want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way is there something else we should have known is there some other question they should have asked is there some other question i should have asked can i say for sure that no one that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different i don t know that that s why i want the inquiry and that s why i would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people not political people but totally non political outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have there is unfortunately a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world and we may have to confront it again and i want to know whether there is anything we can do particularly when there are children involved but i do think it is important to recognize that the wrong doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves q mr president were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from february th until yesterday the president well yes i got regular reports all along the way there were lots of other options pursued if you go back you all covered it very well the fbi you did a very good job of it i mean the fbi and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way and a lot of them early on seemed to be working some of the children got out some of the other people left there was a at one point there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between koresh and the authorities and then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward whether there were other in terms of what happened yesterday the conversation i had with the attorney general did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing because they said they wanted to do this because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves that s what they thought q did the government know that the children did not have gas masks q congressional hearings once the situation are you in agreement with that the president that s up to the congress they can do whatever they want but i think it s very important that the treasury and justice departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts and as i said in my statement if any congressional committees want to look into it we will fully cooperate there is nothing to hide here this was probably the most well covered operation of its kind in the history of the country go ahead sarah q there are two questions i want to ask you the first is i think that they knew very well that the children did not have gas masks while the adults did so the children had no chance because this gas was very she said it was not lethal but it was very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived without gas masks and on february th let s go back didn t those people have a right to practice their religion the president they were not just practicing their religion they were the treasury department believed that they had violated federal laws any number of them q what federal laws the president let me go back and answer i can t answer the question about the gas masks except to tell you that the whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested they were convinced that it wouldn t kill either a child or an adult but it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside and one of the things that i ve heard i don t want to get into the details of this because i don t know but one of the things that they were speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have escaped and that may be why it didn t have the desired effect they also knew sarah that there was an underground compound a bus buried underground where the children could be sent and they were i think they were hoping very much that if the children were not released immediately outside that the humane thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace where they could be protected in terms of the gas masks themselves i learned yesterday i did not ask this fact question before that the gas was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks themselves were to work so that it was thought that even if they all had gas masks that eventually the gas would force them out in a nonviolent nonshooting circumstance ms myers last question q mr president why are you still saying that q could you tell us whether or not you ever asked janet reno about the possibility of a mass suicide and when you learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your mind during those horrendous moments the president what i asked janet reno is if they had considered all the worse things that could happen and she said and of course the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the public he had that had been debated anyway and she said that the people who were most knowledgeable about these kinds of issues concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in the future that was the judgment they made whether they were right or wrong of course we will never know what happened when i saw the fire when i saw the building burning i was sick i felt terrible and my immediate concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were escaping or whether they were inside trying to burn themselves up that s the first thing i wanted to know thank you q mr president why are you still saying it was a janet reno decision isn t it in the end your decision the president well what i m saying is that i didn t have a four or five hour detailed briefing from the fbi i didn t go over every strategic part of it it is a decision for which i take responsibility i m the president of the united states and i signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to make the last call when i talked to her on sunday some time had elapsed she might have made a decision to change her mind i said if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow i will support you and i do support her she is not ultimately responsible to the american people i am but i think she has conducted her duties in an appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation i think as well as she could have thank you applause end p m edt

re freedom of association in article pdb kilimanjaro jpl nasa gov pdb ipl jpl nasa gov paul bartholomew writes a very well put together post i disagree with several key points but the post is an excellent one with which to engage in discourse there has been much discussion recently about the right to freedom of association mr cramer and mr ronzone appear to take an absolutist position on this right that it is a fundamental human right perhaps the fundamental human right and that it supersedes other rights such as the right to an equal opportunity others feel that a right to an equal opportunity outweighs the right to freedom of association and thus we have the never ending debate that flares up repeatedly freedom of association foa involves the mutual and voluntary agreement of two or more people right to equal opportunity lets call it reo involves coercion in all cases by definition a major problem is that neither of these rights are explicitly declared or protected in the constitution or in the declaration of independence although both can be derived from these documents unfortunately this means that the debate will never end because neither side can conclu sively prove the validity of their view it becomes solely a matter of personal philosophy yes there is much debate but no it can end with once and for all recognition of these rights well not totally perfect end but end in the same way that there is no worldwide disagreement that say murder is a crime my personal opinion is that the real answer lies somewhere in between i regard both of these rights as fundamental human rights which unfortu nately come into direct conflict with one another which is stronger depends on the given situation hmm there is even more discusion about religion should we take a somewhere in between approach towards the state a state recognized religion the first amendment is so uh so absolutist you know for example if the owner of a mom and pop store wishes to hire an employee to help out their right to freedom of association outweighs the rights of their job applicants to an equal opportunity they should be free to hire whomever they choose using whatever criteria they choose without any government intervention at all similarly if a family wishes to rent out a bedroom in their home or a garage apartment or something similar then their right to freedom of association outweighs the rights of their prospective tenants to an equal opportunity if on the other hand ibm a multi national corporation with employees publicly owned and operated by a board of directors wishes to hire additional employees then whose freedom of association are we protecting the board of directors the other employees the owners of the stock in this case the applicant s right to an equal opportunity outweighs the right to freedom of association and we as a society can ask ibm to use only those criteria which are relevant to the specific task why says who why can mon pop have foa but ibm be forced and force is the correct word here to have reo as purchase of ibm is voluntary then there are very well defined procedures on how ibm chooses to do some things and chooses to do other things why not let those same procedures work for employment policies similarly if a landlord owns a number of apartment buildings in which he does not live and which are managed by an independent management agency then whose freedom of association are we protecting if the owner does not live in his buildings and has no contact with his tenants then the prospective tenant s right to an equal opportunity outweighs the right to freedom of association and we as a society can ask the owner to use only those criteria which are relevant to good tenants i ve put good in quotation marks because i really don t want to be drawn off into the side issue of what constitutes a good tenant why does this tenant have an option i won t call it a right to destroy the foa of the landlord if the landlord and the tenant can t agree then they both can cease from using each other s property suddenly by arm waving by magic a landlord does not have foa and on what basis does the foa of the landlord disappear it seems that vague terms like no contact with tenants suffice well i think foa is one our most important rightts in the top and by golly if the state is going to make it suffer i sure would like to see the heinous crime that justifies the removal of this right i don t think no contact with the tenats is even a crime much less something that should cause severe interference with important rights i suspect that the majority of the people in this country agree with my position on these extreme cases particularly if they are presented in this manner i don t know if mr ronzone or mr cramer would agree i suspect not in any case additional problems arise when we try to apply guidelines for the middle ground what if the company has employees or or where do we draw the line between protecting the right to freedom of association and protecting the right to an equal opportunity rights are not defined by majority mob choice foa is an absolute reo is a fancy name for thuggery for racism and coercion the difficulty is that any line we draw will of necessity be artificial and any legislation resulting will be flawed in the past the government has usually tried to pass laws which referred to the number of employees hired by the company e g any company with more than xxx employees was affected by the law those with fewer were unaffected of course it would be you dimly see that the line must be artifiacial because foa is the only right just like a state religion you can t jsutify that either generally i believe that if we do not have any regulations affecting these rights then the right to freedom of association will be stronger on the other hand many of the regulations protect the right to an equal opportunity too much weakening the right to freedom of association i don t believe there is a satisfactory solution which will please everybody a solution that i came up with is to use publicly owned vs privately owned as the dividing line if the company remains privately owned then the owners should be free to do whatever they want with their company if the company becomes publicly owned then the public has a right to ask the company to submit to additional regulation why i assume that when you say publicly owned you are talking about those quasi state companys that do not have shareholders the companies on the fortune for example are all privately owned they can give you a list of all of their owners they have no anonymous unknown to them owners by the way the above analysis is based on the assumption that the right to freedom of association and the right to an equal opportunity are both fundamental human rights of equal importance since this is entirely a matter of faith not subject to any proof i do not choose to even try to establish this you either accept it or you don t any comments foa can be derived by any two rational people on a basis that neither has evil malicious or murderous intent towards the others in short agreement is mutual or not at all your reo on the other hand lives only by accepting coercion the gun into the situation and that is self destructive of the whole argument because it is based only on might makes right sort of like saying nobody has a right to live whereupon i whip out a gun and shoot you dead end of argument there are actually people that still believe love canal was some kind of environmental disaster weird eh these opinions are mine and you can t have em but i ll rent em cheap
re eight myths about national health insurance pt ii v pxgt ubvmsb cc buffalo edu daniel b case writes gld cunixb cc columbia edu gary l dare writes you re not buying insurance so much as being coerced into one insurance plan no it is optional as it is optional for doctors to accept it there are isolated religeous communities in particular that ask for exemptions and one e mail from a christian scientist in edmonton verified for me that it is indeed negative option i guess that you can argue that there is a right to having a particular insurance but so far i ve not come across that up north and i take pains to keep tabs with news from home it s optional but what if you don t want basic coverage on the government s terms you said before that if you opt out you re basically uninsured there are two things at work here the public insurance is very wide in what it will cover as the amortization is also universal no private plan can boast of a plan that fits a gaussian curve and as our private sector has discovered they re better off not offering insurance coverage that their customers are going to use and that turns the private insurers offering the frills into an effective cartel they don t really need to compete because as you put it they re in a win win situation and they re guaranteed to turn a profit believe me they probably had orgasms when they figured that out and according to my sister the yuppie they pat themselves on the back to the point of ungraciousness at chamber of commerce luncheons so in a sense they ve stopped being truly capitalists if they don t have to worry about competing anymore you might say that the total effect is one of socialized medicine a government providing the basics and a cartel providing the extras there is no alternative to the system desirable or not the alternative to the system is no system at all patients opted out doctors opted out or both but that only for insurance and you can t force a private insurance company to sell you a plan that they will not offer and remember that the actual health care is delivered by private entities who collect from the public insurance voluntarily again they can t force a private entity to spring to life to pay them plus there is the matter of culture and values i m basically anti tax and anti government by canadian standards yet i can t bring myself to make the same arguments as you do despite that i understand where you re coming from up north you re so much more likely to find someone protesting taxes going to defence than health insurance premiums to only one fund for basic coverage interesting side note have any new insurance companies started up from scratch since medicare became standard in canada i actually have doubts that any new ones have emerged since ww i no scratch that there are a few in western canada and quite a few in quebec as part of the post quebec miracle out with the nationalism in with the french capitalism la groupe des cooper antes built a new tower by the eaton s store at les terraces and if you were able to catch urban angel on cbs s crimetime you d see it as the well lit one with double turrets at the top as for ontario which still dominates and anchors business up north i meant new companies not new buildings yes primarily in quebec and in alberta sorry i musta lost you in that verbose blurb it s not really insurance if you don t have alternatives well you have to realize that in our society that s like saying that it s not really national defence because you can t hire your own rambo squad instead or even opting out as a pacifist true but i would be more comfortable with a system in which basic care provided by the government was optional not mandatory in canada and germany it s not mandatory however it is negative option in that you must request the exemption that the private sector will not provide private basic coverage if offered the option as in the quebec case tells me something about what they know either way the transient situations are hard to deal with since the changes in the private medical care resource take place at a slower rate than the ability of people to fall sick esp in the light of disasters e g chernobyl or bad luck a sudden wave of heart disease a doctor needs years of training plus internship and specialty training another problem with the us system that should be resolved doesn t canada have something like ten times the proportion of gps to specialists that the us does yes but part of the reason is that our most of our markets are too small to sustain many specialists sometimes not even one so you pretty well have to be a gp to get paid and if you do get the training the doctors monopoly might block your getting of a licence because there is already someone in the business and who cannot fill his her appointment book that we have a cma doctors monopoly is something that the american ama oriented medical lobby never tells you down here the problem is in a specialty your skill often directly correlates to your pay a good cardiologist makes more than a merely adequate cardiologist more than it does in general practice in that circumstance it s hard to blame people for going into specialties no i respect people who do specialties okay all of my md friends are but there s the question of our small market dynamics up north if anything that our private doctors and hospitals sell their services to americans to generate more business will inflate their effective population served and thus make some specialties finally viable i e there will be enough customers we just do not have enough sick canadians in absolute numbers otherwise i personally think an approach like germany s would be best where the companies compete for batches of people rochester a little east of us was able to get almost all of its population covered that way uh germany basically uses our method with their many sickness funds the competition is fake if it exists at all because they re all interlinked look in der spiegel or stern my girlfriend is in our german department and her uncle is a private practicioner in saarbrucken no ads for health insurance while canada organizes by province germany organizes the paperwork around big corporations and regional offices but remember that we have provinces that have the same population as some major german corporations germans have public health insurance just that it is brokered by smaller entities actually brokerage of basic by private firms who ll sell extra insurance to fill out their policies sort of a voucher system was one of the first ideas floated in canada too remember the germans don t have hmo s a telling sign cos rochester does and they re also a company town but there was a washington post article recently about that that said canadian doctors often use myelograms instead of mris which require spinal injections and can cause seizures and headaches mickey kaus in the new republic probably spoke for most americans when he said who needs that i think people here generally like to believe they can easily get the most high tech treatment even if they really can t afford it i ll have to let a canadian md jump in to verify that claim but i ve come to learn to suspect anything in the american press about our system if much or some of it were true you d have to take us for idiots for tolerating it and given that our insurance was installed during a period when there were only liberal and tory governments federally and provincially and the socialists are still chafing they would ve pressed for real socialized medicine to fix things think about it after all we are using the u s as a metric to make comparison both for keeping up with the joneses as for confirming that we did something right gld je me souviens gary l dare gld columbia edu go winnipeg jets go gld cunixc bitnet selanne domi stanley

re eight myths about national health insurance pt ii v pxgt ubvmsd cc buffalo edu daniel b case writes gld cunixb cc columbia edu gary l dare writes again they can t force a private entity to spring to life to pay them so the government by sheer economic force has basically cleared the basic care market for itself the only way to test this would be for some really daring person to start up from scratch in alberta and or quebec a health insurance company offering basic care crazy yes but that s almost how mci got started however the concept of risks is well known by insurance actuaries and no private firm can get the kind of amortization that the public pools can get and since health insurance gets spent that doesn t sit well with the insurance ceo s and you get a situation like in the u s where rates keep going up to catch up see what i mean it s a government monopoly sure because it s a non market phenomenom and the free market can t solve it even our private insurance says that and remember last year quebec proposed giving the least risky parts of basic care to the private sector and they balked like you said why should they and wants no part of it by your own arguments if you don t want the provincial plan you re basically up a creek yes but in our culture arguing against it is like arguing for national defence by means of warlords true according to polls i ve read usually in the sort of simpleminded stuff you were initally responding to something like of americans would like canadian style health care whereas only of canadians would like it our way i d be interested to know why there are that many of canada s population is about a million or so people canada is saturated by american media while pundits come on cable and talk about how awful our health care is supposed to be what people experience up north ends up not differing from what they see portrayed on american television in movies i e same infrastructure different insurance make up yet they know not of any insurance problems and have no idea of what an hmo is but having lots of british tv as well they know that they don t like nhs someone must have a reason to argue against it valid or not what kind of people are they the polls that you refer to for the canadian data are from the annual july st polls conducted for macleans our major english newsmagazine by decima research decima president allen gregg is considered one of the world s top poll researchers and mulroney s conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in the face of impossible election situations the american polls are harris polls and have been reposted on usenet a few times and probably will again i m sorta suspicious myself cos maybe americans want universal coverage like canada i honestly doubt that most americans realize that we have private doctors and public and private hospitals i e similiar health care infrastructure and our system is basically pure insurance without hmo s given recent turnarounds by the hiaa endorsing universal coverage and hostility to corporatist hmo s within the ama and the complete silence vis a vis canada bashing by the ama i suspect that they re keeping the secret about canada up their sleeve exactly wouldn t you until the idea of managed competition arose there was no direct threat to stand alone private practice in the s the ama fought hmo s as corporatized socialist medicine part of the reason why we have only insurance and no hmo s in canada cos that was part of the deal cut with the cma i ve also read that the three biggest american hmos can be compared straight up against some of the smaller canadian provinces in the maritimes and they spend something like less per patient maybe it does help the american hmo s can still cream and they probably cover a smaller geographic area than even our smallest provinces geography again some of them are spread out across the whole country i think but each site is probably compact and the clientele are creamed and don t forget that hmo s place caps on your coverage and often won t tell you about additional procedures you could get otherwise despite that you might be willing to pay for it gld je me souviens gary l dare gld columbia edu go winnipeg jets go gld cunixc bitnet selanne domi stanley

re waco is gov t fault was re libertarian party on cia fbi atf in article c wkyg fy dscomsa desy de hallam zeus desy de writes in article apr happy uccs edu etbeteille happy uccs edu writes here are several shreds of evidence that prove the waco disaster is the government s fault they raided an american s property because of rumors about koresh s intentions with some converted yet still nd amendment protected firearms a judge approved warrant justifies nothing in a democracy under the rule of law a search warrant justifies a search the us constitution does not justify murder of those attempting to mount a search for illegally held weapons a search for illegally held weapons if there were any no evidence yet produced to this effect does not justify firing into a house with women and children either it also does not justify shooting first without identifying oneself the atf and fbi have done this before so don t say they haven t please or producing a warrant guess it depends on whose story one believes huh it took them days to think of a basic terrorist tactic i e tear gas and this could only be justified in support of rescuing any supposed hostages inside the govt has a right to use lethal force in certain cases attempts to capture dangerous criminals who are armed and threatening the lives of others which others are we talking about here is one in this case they used sub lethal force sub lethal excuse me but those people are dead the gov t immediately imprisoned these so called hostages the children were held hostage evidence so far the fbi has produced none don t hold your breath the adults were wanted variously for murder and conspiracy to murder only a few of those being held in chains and s hackles are wanted the rest are being held for the crime of being material witnesses it took hundreds of gov t agents with tax funded cellular phones ten minutes to dial for the fire department they should not have called the fire dept at all there was no role for them to play in a situation where those that might be rescued might well shoot at them it was not the feds decision to make but the firefighters calling the fire dept meant that waco was deprived of a resource that might have been needed elsewhere should a situation where it could have been used arisen this is true of any answer to a call for help from a fire department by any citizen since fire departments do answer calls that deprive resources that might be needed elsewhere it is not a valid reason for not calling them further since the davidians had not been found guilty of any crime in a court of law they are subject to the same protection as any other citizen and las far as i know even criminals in prison are not left to burn to death in a fire by cutting off the water supply in the surrounding area the gov t guaranteed that any fire at the compound would be fatal any fire started deliberately uising lamp oil is likely to be fatal i guess this is a matter of religious faith with you the government says it so it must be so or haven t you been reading this thread well enough to notice that some of us here don t beleive their story no one had the foresight to station rescue vehicles nearby in the first place they are a scarce resource a bunch of psychos cannot deprive the neighbourhood of a resource that might be required in a genuine case patients in psychiatric hospitals are not left to die in fires either besides as i explained some of us here believe their distress might have been genuine are you so certain it wasn t the gov t conveniently forgot all that freedom of religion stuff freedom of religion does not include human sacrifice nor does it include other forms of murder there is no evidence that the davidians committed human sacrifice either before of after the initial raid and self defense is not murder the gov t arguably started or at least fanned the fire themselves the govt arguably is run by communists or the trilateral commission he did not say it was deliberate accidents do not require conspiracy theories only wanton disregard for human life the initial raid alone agents firing blind into walls against all standards of law enforce ment procedure proves they did not mind killing people finally and this may be a stretch for some of you statists out there but koresh s original reasons for holing up in such a compound may have something to do with the continual interference from the gov t new taxes new regulations and increasing involvement in every aspect of our personal and economic lives life on a compound might become the way of the future it might have to be let us hope that those who support koresh are not allowed to enforce this upon the rest of us no one here is supporting koresh we are opposing the illegal use of excessive violence by our government against our citizens that is all their reasons for supporting the ownership of high power weaponry are clear enough they hope that this will be the catylist for the destruction of the fabric of society and allow them to enforce their nightmare vision of the future a society that believes it is ok to terrorize people for their religious views will destroy itself in due time it is the feds who disrupted the fabric of society in waco not koresh it is the feds who forced a nightmare onto the people of mount carmel it would be a good thing for people to study history on what basis do you assume we haven t don t you really mean it would be a good thing if people drew the same conclusions from history that i do in particular a group of militant militant implies acts of aggression against one s neighbors the davidians left their neighbors alone religious heretics who left to set up such a community some time ago a few years latter they had captured medina and destroyed the idols in the kabba within ten years the whole of arabia was under islam so what the mormons were considered a cult for years and were chased out of one place after another on much the same thinking as you are advocating when they finally got to set up a community they left people alone so far americans haven t been put to the sword by mormon hordes crying to avenge joseph smith just because a group of people start by saying that all they want is to be left alone does not mean that that is how they will stay it doesn t mean they won t either anyway the whole purpose of a system of laws is to punish people for what they do not what they might do the pat robertsons oral roberts and jimmy swaggarts of this world are quite telling other people how to

re cults waco insanity in article c w c h srgenprp sr hp com patk sr hp com patrick kearney writes assuming for the sake of argument that the branch davidian people immolated themselves in the manner described by the federal authorities why does the general consensus appear to be that they the bd were insane is it the manner of their behaviour before they died or the fact they chose to kill themselves rather than submit to the government i ask this question because there is a tradition and one that is highly regarded by many people that several hundred jews elected to throw themselves off a cliff at masada rather than submit to roman rule the circumstances at masada and those at waco would seem in general terms quite similar and yet so far as i m aware nobody has seriously suggested that the jews were insane the point of this comparison is to question the use of the word cult in discussing the events at waco why were the davidians a cult and not the jews at masada what constitutes a cult is it the size of the membership or a matter of respectability or perhaps the length of time it s been in existence are the catholics a cult how about the mormons or the calvinists is a sect a respectible cult dictionary definitions aside since popular usage seems to carry more weight i suspect that the word cult is used in a perjorive sense when speaking of groups like the davidians it is rather like the word boss when used to describe someone unpopular or someone the government wishes to make unpopular like say castro the communist boss of cuba one doesn t hear clinton described as america s democratic or capitalist boss well for one thing most if not all the dividians depending on whether they could show they acted in self defense and there were no illegal weapons could have gone on with their life as they were living it no one was forcing them to give up their religion or even their legal weapons the dividians had survived a change in leadership before so even if koresch himself would have been convicted and sent to jail they still could have carried on i don t think the dividians were insane but i don t see a reason for mass suicide if the fire was intentional set by some of the dividians we also don t know that if the fire was intentionally set from inside was it a generally know plan or was this something only an inner circle knew about or was it something two or three felt they had to do with or without koresch s knowledge blessing etc i don t know much about masada were some people throwing others over did mothers jump over with their babies in their arms richard
re drugs and crime a new approach mwilson ncratl atlantaga ncr com mark wilson writes missing the entire point of my post kebarnes msuvx memst edu wrote given that the trade in illegal drugs is responsible for much of the crime which afflicts our nation there is much evidence that it is the fact that the drugs are illegal not the drugs themselves that have caused the violence witness prohibition and the violence that surrounded the trade in alcohol no joke people who want drugs particularly people who are predisposed to addiction will find a way to get them whether or not they are legally available this is suppossed to be an argument for keeping drugs illegal no you jumped to that conclusion it s actually an argument as to how to accomplish the societal good of discouraging drug use without violating individual rights despite current law enforcement efforts drugs are readily available to those who want them this is suppossed to be an argument for keeping drugs illegal no you missed the point the point is the war on drugs is a failure and is counterproductive addiction to drugs boh legal and illegal is responsible for a significant drain on the productive resources of our country and this occurs in a variety of ways from the cocaine addicted babies who are unable to learn to the spread of disease among addicts to the tragic consequences of alcohol abuse and tobacco smoking the crack baby scenario has been thouroughly discredited it just so happens that the symptoms seen in the crack babies are identical to fetal alcohol syndrome and the mothers who admitted to taking crack also admitted to drinking heavily during pregnancy in this country people are free to be stupid if they want to but they are not free to be stupid and injure other people admittedly the fetal right to life is outside the scope of this discussion however it s ridiculous to assert as you apparently do that cocaine has no effect on the developing fetal nervous system caffiene and nicotine have fetal effects too why should cocaine be any exception a general economic principle of government is that whatever is subsidized you get more of and whatever is taxed you get less of to be most effective in confronting the nation s drug problem some way must be found to utilize these additional powers of government to make drug dealing and drug use less attractive so make the drugs legal tax them and use the tax money to fund a program to tell people how studid drugs are it has worked for the legal drugs if you had read my article before writing your knee jerk response you would have seen that this is exactly what i advocated while this country s current efforts to combat legal drugs have succeeded in some respects there is a greater awareness of the health consequences of smoking and designated driver programs have helped reduce drunk driving for example the same cannot be said for the war on illegal drugs there remains a core group of illegal drug users which support international networks of smugglers pushers growers processors kingpins and gangsters these networks and their marketing activities which include drive by shootings corrupting law enforcement authorities and smuggling weapons are directly or indirectly responsible for a large proportion of the crimes committed in our country every day each and every one of these problems is a direct result of the drug trade being illegal no shit sherlock clearly illegal drugs and rising crime are linked it takes only a moment s reflection to recognize how they are linked the link is money as with this country s failed effort to prohibit alcohol consumption a black market has been created in which greedy local monopolies like the gangsters of a bygone era have profited enormously from their illegal trade the victims of this trade include not only the innocent people unfortunate enough to be caught in the crossfire but i would argue the drug users themselves a great argument for making drugs legal thank you how could you have missed the point so utterly what have you been smoking here then is my proposal possession and use of all presently illegal drugs is decriminalized but buying and selling them remains illegal potheads can grow their own marijuana as many already do today other drug users can legally import their poison of choice as long as they pay the tariffs and a barter economy of drug experimenters develops your solution has done nothing to eliminate the violence in the drug trade btw how is someone going to import a drug if buying it is illegal i think you need to think your solution through a little more thouroughly obviously importers will not be buying drugs in the u s under u s jurisdiction use your remaining brain cells because of the barter economy which supplies the drug users the black market profits that have so enriched the drug lords dwindle if these drugs can be obtained for free or next to nothing why buy them nevertheless there will be those who will seek to sell these noncommercial drugs even at relatively low prices therefore you have failed to indicate how these drugs can be obtained for free or next to nothing you have stated that the sale of them is illegal o k i ll spell it out for you barter economy means that drug users will be permitted to grow or synthesize chemically anything they choose or to buy it outside the u s and bring it in if it won t grow here they will also be permitted to trade with other drug users for drugs other than the ones they themselves grow or manufacture they will not however be able to legally sell their drugs for money both manufacture and importation of noncommercial drugs will be taxed to discourage their use this is your brain on drugs any questions law enforcement activity is concentrated on those individuals who continue to buy and sell and also on the crimes committed by drug users too poor to afford even low prices but here is where the strategy begins to differentiate between the drug dealers the victimizers and the drug users their victims in most cities this is already the strategy it has already failed and is dragging the rest of us down with it pardon me but possession use of these drugs is still a crime you cannot analogize the rates at which drug users would seek treatment and the comparative ease with which it could be made available today when these drugs are illegal to possess use with what it would be were they not illegal to possess use decriminalizing possession and use makes treatment much easier drug dealers are exploiting the weaknesses of those persons who are prone to addiction and as such the drug users should be left alone not thrown in prison along with their victimizers drug dealers are the criminals and should be treated as such drug addiction does not absolve you of responsiblity for your criminal actions however upon arrest for any crime suspects are permitted to choose whether or not they will undergo a drug test those who choose to cooperate are informed that upon conviction for the crime they are accused of if they are found to be a drug user they will be institutionalized until they are clean and only then will they begin to serve their sentence if they choose to cooperate and are already drug free they can begin to serve their sentence right away those who choose not to undergo the drug test and are convicted face stiffer fines and serve longer sentences this sounds a hell of a lot like self incrimination which is unconstitutional if drug use is legal in your scheme why should the presence of drugs in anyones system influence the penalty they receive much too big brotherish for my tastes the drug test of an arrested suspect is voluntary not coerced and does not therefore constitute violation of amendment v those convicted who are drug users as evidenced by the test are in need of treatment for their problem institutionalization of these adddicted criminals is i would argue the best way to help them straighten out if they refuse the test and are convicted their sentence can be appropriately harsher since they unlike the addict have no excuse for their crimes institutionalization of drug using criminals serves several purposes drug using criminals and this includes drunk and or stoned drivers are separated from their sources of supply thus reducing the total number of drug users in society at large and consequently decreasing the demand for drugs on the street putting more of the remaining drug dealers out of business why should drug using criminals be treated any different from other criminals you have already stated that drug use is legal mark wilson atlantaga ncr com why not my objective is to discourage drug use and criminal behavior if fewer criminals do drugs out of fear of getting a harsher sentence if they are convicted why is that not a good thing if fewer drug dealers who are still criminals btw can find victims why is that not a good thing if fewer drug users such as drunks potheads etc commit crimes out of fear of being cut off from their sources of supply why is that not a good thing i m certainly willing to debate my position you have to read it

clinton am press briefing by dee dee myers the white house office of the press secretary for immediate release april press briefing by dee dee myers the briefing room a m edt ms myers okay today s schedule as you know the president jogged this morning with senator wofford at p m he will have a photo opportunity in the rose garden to present the teacher of the year award at p m he will meet with his principal advisors on bosnia and at p m he ll meet with president vaclav havel there will be a photo op at the top of that meeting no formal press conference afterwards any questions q is he moving towards some major decision this week on bosnia ms myers as we ve said he s continuing to discuss his options he s been talking extensively with his foreign policy advisors his bosnia advisors as well as with other world leaders he ll try to contact president mitterrand again today and he ll continue to discuss it we don t have any specific timetable but obviously the situation there is very serious q has he called janet reno today or yesterday ms myers i don t believe he s spoken to her today q why does he have nothing to say about this publicly except on the piece of paper that was put out last night at p m ms myers he did he answered a question about it yesterday q before anything had happened ms myers before anything happened he put out q since something has happened he s had nothing to say ms myers he s put out a statement on it last night and we ll have more to say about it later today q in what forum is that going to be ms myers it will be at the photo in the rose garden q he will talk about waco at that ms myers yes he ll have something to say q is that something we can take live ms myers i think it will be brief we can talk a little later about the exact structure as we work it out but i don t know if it s something you d want to take live q will he take questions on waco at that time as well ms myers he ll probably take a few q is there any reason why he hasn t talked to the attorney general ms myers i ll have to double check i don t know that he hasn t talked to her this morning q and she didn t come here this morning to see him or anyone else ms myers no q and he didn t talk yesterday q what s the reaction to her resignation statement that she made last night ms myers she was asked a question about it and she answered the question the president has absolutely no intention of asking for the attorney general s resignation he stands behind her percent as you know he was informed about the decision he takes full responsibility for that and stands percent behind attorney general reno q the question now arises yesterday we were told that he was briefed on this but we never got a firm idea of how much he knew of what the plan was and the justification for the plan and the justification of the timing was he fully informed on all of that all of this about the increasing levels of violence inside the compound that made them want to go now the feeling that nothing else was going to succeed et cetera ms myers he talked with the attorney general about the decision about she talked to him about the factors that led to her decision he raised no objections he supports her decision to go forward with it he was fully briefed q of course hindsight is but looking back now does the president does the white house feel that the decision he signed off on proved to be the right way to go when you look at what actually happened ms myers i think everybody feels bad when life is lost but i don t think that that is reason to second guess the decision he stands behind the decision that was made he was informed about it he was fully briefed about it and he stands percent behind the attorney general the justice department and the fbi it s a difficult operation and there s it had already gone on for more than seven weeks four federal agents had lost their lives in the line of duty let s not forget that this was a very difficult situation and all the decisions involved were very difficult but all the agents on the ground the fbi the justice department all recommended moving forward with this they thought given the circumstances it was the best possible course of action there s just no point in second guessing those decisions now i think that there s a reason q why not they have to ms myers no not to second guess the decisions i think it s important to take a look at it to have an investigation i think the president will talk some about that later today but at this from this vantage point to second guess those decisions it s not useful q you sound like he s going to order an investigation of what happened and whether ms myers i think he ll have more to say about that later yes q he will order an investigation ms myers he ll have more yes he ll have more to say about an investigation q what kind of investigation ms myers he ll have more to say about it later q but in the monday morning quarterbacking surely there is some soul searching now as to whether it was the right decision you can t say that we did the best we could when it turned out to be a rather a debacle ms myers i think we ll obviously we ll review the situation and all the factors that lead to a very tragic outcome i don t think anybody disputes that the outcome was tragic but again the president stands behind the decisions that were made and we ll take a look at the factors that contributed to that q what was the fbi director s role in this ms myers well he was obviously involved in setting up the operation he signed off on it as did the agents that were on the ground that were working with him i don t believe he spoke to the president but i ll double check that q but he was very closely involved in every aspect of planning and so forth ms myers i would refer you to the fbi on exactly what aspects he was involved with q will janet reno be coming over to the white house today ms myers there s no planned meeting i don t believe that she ll be here q she won t be at this event at p m ms myers no no plans to be q do you think that there s going to be a jumping on on the part of political opposition to make something out of this in terms of to the president s detriment politically ms myers well i would certainly hope that people wouldn t try to use this tragedy for political reasons obviously i think again that it s useful to look at the facts to reevaluate the facts and i think the president will move forward with that but i think people understand that this was a difficult series of decisions that it was a very difficult situation that it was caused by a man who was a cult leader who was involved in the death of four federal agents and i think it s most tragic that a lot of innocent children lost their lives in this i don t think anybody disputes the tragedy of the outcome q dee dee what was the white house role in handling the i guess public relations aspect in the aftermath who was talking who here at the white house was talking with people at justice to set up reno s news conference to do all that sort of thing ms myers i think the attorney general handled her end of the situation herself and made the decision to go ahead with the news conference once there was a point at which there was enough information i think to talk with some accuracy about what had transpired during the day obviously people here at a number of levels were keeping in touch with people at the justice department and at the fbi to try to keep informed about what was happening there q but reno said that she didn t talk to the president and there seemed to be an indication she hadn t talked to anybody at the white house so who ms myers there were people talking on a staff to staff level q i understand but who at the justice department was handling that for reno who was talking to the white house ms myers there were a number of people as you know webb hubbell is the liaison to the white house and i know he talked to a number of people here there were a number of people at a number of different levels involved i don t want to get into exactly who had what conversations with whom but there were a number of conversations obviously the justice department was working to keep the white house informed the press informed to the best of its ability as events unfolded throughout the day q did webb hubbell talk to the president ms myers i don t believe so i don t know if he talked he may have at one point q and was the white house role just to seek information about what happened or was it to direct the public information campaign that followed ms myers it was both to keep abreast of the situation so the president could be on top of it but i think the justice department managed its press relations on it we were obviously very interested in what was happening there throughout the day and the president was following it very closely throughout the day q dee dee on that though if the president was following it so closely and he had talked the night before with janet reno why wouldn t he talk to her at all since then ms myers again i don t know if he s talked to her this morning again he s kept fully aware of what has been going on throughout the day he stands percent behind her decisions he s been fully supportive of her as he said yesterday morning before events transpired and yesterday afternoon in a written statement q but wouldn t he want to convey those thoughts to her personally yesterday ms myers one more time i don t know if they ve spoken this morning q no yesterday q clearly there s a perception that she was left hung out to dry all day yesterday ms myers that s just not true i think we said throughout the day that the president takes full responsibility that he stands i don t know how much clearer we can be the president stands foursquare behind the attorney general on this he accepts full responsibility for the events that transpired he believes that janet reno the justice department and the fbi acted as best they could given the circumstances and the facts that were evident at the time i don t know what else he can say to show that he supports her percent q one of the best indications of that is to pick up the phone and tell her ms myers again i don t know whether they ve spoken this morning q why can t we find out ms myers well we can i can t do it standing here right now q you ve got six people here all they ve got to do is pick up the phone ms myers helen we ll get back to you q dee dee when the president spoke with the attorney general on sunday is it safe to assume that either she volunteered or he inquired about whether there was a possible downside to increasing pressure on the davidians ms myers i think that they discussed the situation again i m not going to get into the specific details of what exactly she told him but i think that he was aware of the risks involved q dee dee the president yesterday morning said it was entirely her decision she then said that she told him what was happening and he said okay does the president regard it that he gave the go ahead or that she gave the go ahead ms myers i think what they both said yesterday was that she made a decision based on all the available facts she informed him about that and he raised no objections again i don t know how much clearer we can be about that q and he said okay the issue is over the responsibility ms myers he said okay q does okay mean ms myers the president accepts ultimate responsibility q dee dee the president s investigation that he s going to announce would that be conducted by someone outside the administration ms myers no q it would be internal is it meant to preclude any congressional investigation ms myers no it s meant simply to follow up on the incidents that occurred yesterday q and you would i assume therefore cooperate fully with any congressional hearings that would be held ms myers to the best of our ability q dee dee there are two reports out this morning one that the justice department or fbi or whomever apparently had a bug planted inside the complex and the other is that the children may have been injected with some kind of poison that may have either left them unconscious or maybe even killed them before the fire what do you know about those two ms myers nothing more than i ve seen in news accounts this morning we may get more on it later but at this point i know i m not sure anybody knows any more than what was reported by people who came out of the compound q has the president received any report today in terms of fatalities and actually what was going on what they ve been able to find out on in the compound now ms myers he s been briefed i don t think that they ve gotten into the compound yet they were still waiting for it to cool off i don t think there s much beyond what s been reported in the news accounts but he has been kept up to date on it q dee dee the president stands behind attorney general reno but does he feel that she perhaps got bad advice from the so called experts ms myers he believes that she made he stands behind the decision that she made it was the unanimous decision of her advisors of the fbi of the agents on the ground and he supports that q what about the validity of the decisions made on the ground does he back those ms myers he s not going to second guess decisions made q dee dee you just said he stands behind the decision which she made normally in a situation like this the president says i made the decision but you re saying she made the decision ms myers i m saying that the president was briefed about the decision he okayed it and he accepts full responsibility for it q but then why do you keep using the terminology the decision that she made rather than the decision that he made ms myers because as he said yesterday she evaluated the facts based on evidence presented to her by justice department and fbi which is part of the justice department and made a decision and then briefed the president on that decision that is how the chain of command works she briefed him he signed off on it the operation went forward and the president accepts full responsibility q in that chain of command analogy there i want to go back to sessions a moment do you know if this was a plan that came through him to reno or was it presented to her around him or with his involvement what was his involvement ms myers again you d have to go to the justice department for the specific interaction between the attorney general and the director q does the president stand behind director sessions ms myers he supports again i don t know how many different ways i can say this he supports the decisions made by the justice department and the fbi he fully supports the attorney general in this i m not stepping away from the director of the fbi i want to but janet reno is the one who briefed him the one who made the decisions as the head of the justice department as you know the director of the fbi reports to the attorney general the attorney general made the decision she informed the president about those decisions he okayed it he didn t raise any objections to it and he accepts full responsibility q do you have based on what you know here at the white house any concerns about william sessions performance during this ms myers nothing to suggest that no q along those same lines just in your initial review of the situation how much do you think the problems might have come from not having a justice department that s fully staffed and having an fbi director who is still quite uncertain about his status ms myers i just don t think that had anything to do with it i think the agents on the ground the operation went forward i m not going to speculate on that q did the white house express any alarm that janet reno chose to speak to the live network media before she chose to speak to clinton ms myers no she was carrying forward her responsibility to inform the public about the events of yesterday i think she did a very admirable job the president agrees with that q before sunday how often was the president briefed on the situation in waco ms myers he was kept updated on a regular basis on a daily basis q who briefed the president ms myers well i m not going to get into exactly who what conversations he had with whom but he was kept up to date on the events in waco he has daily briefings on a number of issues q no no was this a regular briefing conducted by a white house staff person or was it by a justice department person ms myers he s briefed regularly by a white house staff on a number of issues again i m not going to get into exactly who briefs him on what subjects q another subject q on another subject q now we re going to do gays in the military laughter ms myers i welcome it q how close are you to signing the biodiversity treaty ms myers as you know the president s giving a speech on earth day tomorrow we ll have more to say about it then q any details on where or when that speech is yet ms myers it s at a m and i don t know where yet q dee dee is this a major policy address how would you characterize the speech tomorrow ms myers i would characterize it as a earth day speech i wouldn t look for any major departures from his past positions on these things but again i don t want to get too much into what he s going to talk about tomorrow q on or off campus q is this at a location outside the white house ms myers it will be somewhere in washington we don t know exactly where yet q dee dee what foreign leaders has the president talked to since friday on the situation in bosnia ms myers only prime minister major and again he ll try to reach president mitterrand again this morning q david owen said yesterday and joe biden said today both of them agree that the peace process is not going to work that the serbs are not going to sign on does the administration still believe that it can work and that they will sign on ms myers obviously the ultimate goal is some sort of peaceful resolution to the conflict in bosnia as you know the administration is considering a wide variety of options at this point the situation there in and around srebrenica and the rest of eastern bosnia is quite serious and the president will meet with his bosnian advisors today and continue to press forward on this q is that a question they re going to try to be deciding whether or not the peace plan remains viable ms myers again they ll be reviewing a number of options including the peace plan q does the group that he s meeting with today include reg bartholomew ms myers i don t believe he s here but it will be among the usual secretary christopher secretary aspin general powell q dee dee do you have anything on the apparent encounter by u s f s over bosnia today some aircraft violating the no fly zone ms myers no i don t i ll get back to you on that q will the president be meeting with every one of the leaders coming to town for the holocaust museum ms myers he will he ll be meeting as you know with vaclav havel today and with lech walesa tomorrow and then with the rest of the group tomorrow afternoon q as a group or one by one ms myers i believe it s as a group now havel and walesa asked for meetings early and these have been on the agenda for quite some time but he will meet with all of the foreign heads of state that are here q dee dee has the president decided whether he supports the gay and lesbian civil rights act and has anything been worked out for him to address the march on sunday ms myers i think he ll probably have a letter or some kind of a statement to the march we haven t worked out the exact details of that q not a live phone hook up ms myers probably not given the logistics of getting to boston the speech as you know is at p m the answer to the other part of your question is no he hasn t taken a position on it q you said that speech in boston was at p m ms myers i believe so yes q do you know what it s on ms myers we ll still working out q general vessey s coming back tonight from vietnam when will he be meeting with the president ms myers no specific meeting is scheduled we ll talk to him at some point and see we look forward to his report but exactly how he ll make that report is unclear q so he s not going to come immediately to the white house ms myers no q the aids czar how close are you ms myers still working on it q drug czar q do you expect it before the march ms myers i don t have a time line on it q did the president ask senator mitchell to try the lloyd cutler ploy to break the filibuster ms myers i don t believe so q why not ms myers he s just not going to q are senate democrats here at this hour ms myers no that s tomorrow tomorrow at a m q update on the stimulus possible scaling down ms myers as you know the senate will vote on amendments today we ll continue to talk the president is committed to some kind of a jobs package we d like to see it passed and we ll continue in conversations throughout the day and see where we end up q when this briefing is over can you give us word through the speaker or whatever whether the president s talked to janet reno ms myers we ll be happy to q it s become a pressing question for the last several hours ms myers no just this minute that i ve been here and i haven t had a chance to follow up on it helen q does he have an opinion on hatfield ms myers i mean obviously he prefers he offered a compromise package of billion he believes that that s the best alternative believes that he s obviously willing to take a second look at the package and i think the senate will vote on that today and we re hopeful that the president s bill which will be the mitchell amendment will be the one that will be approved q dee dee is there any white house official that will be at the march on sunday ms myers somebody will be there representing the president i don t know who yet q well has it been decided how he s going to address is it going to be a videotape or a phone call ms myers i think it will probably be a letter but there hasn t been a final decision on that yet q the official will read the letter is that what it sounds like ms myers correct q lloyd bentsen came in here this morning do you know what was that about was that about this waco thing ms myers no actually it wasn t it may have come up but it was about economic issues q on health care is the th of may still the target ms myers that s still the target q and there s talk about a joint session of congress speech at the end of may ms myers we haven t resolved exactly how the president will present the health care plan to the people i wouldn t rule that out as an option but no decisions have been made end a m edt

waco i don t want to attack anyone s personal opinions and thus have not included any articles but it seems to me incredibly ridiculous and pompous for someone to sit back with the benefit of hindsight and point fingers at clinton reno the fbi or whomever first of all it is a knee jerk judgement the facts are quite muddled at this point and will likely be for quite a while secondly things do not improve by pointing blame and accusatory fingers pointing fingers is a destructive action if everyone sat around pointing fingers all the time nothing would get done and nothing would ever get any better and despite the tragedy we can learn something from this if it is approached in a constructive manner doesn t it seem that working together is more productive than working against one another thirdly it seems incredibly hypocritical to place blame given the benefit of hindsight something that those who made the decisions did not have the benefit of why not give them the courtesy of acknowledging that they did the best they could with the data they had in a very very difficult situation some responses have gone so far to suggest that the actions were done without regard for the lives of the people in the compound give me a break be part of the solution not the problem and that s my opinion david

clinton am press briefing by dee dee myers the white house office of the press secretary for immediate release april press briefing by dee dee myers the briefing room a m edt ms myers at p m we re having a press conference bill in the east room and then saturday the president will leave here at roughly a m and fly down to jamestown he will spend the day there overnight at camp david on sunday it s unclear exactly what time he ll leave camp david and fly to boston he ll leave from hagerstown the press plane will leave from washington he will meet with some q what kind of a plane is that he s taking ms myers that he s taking he ll probably take a c q from hagerstown ms myers from hagerstown air force one doesn t fly out of hagerstown apparently q how will the pool travel ms myers the pool will have to meet him ahead of time so i guess the pool will travel with the press plane and wait for him at the airport there is currently no provision and i ll double check because there s currently no provision i think that s standard operating practice q the pool is not going to meet him and watch him get on the plane at hagerstown ms myers i don t believe so q what time does he have to be in boston ms myers he s going to meet there with a group of citizens mostly people who supported us during the campaign at around p m we re still working out the final times q at the airport ms myers no it will be at the boston harbor hotel and then he will also meet with some a youth group that authored something called project the speech to the publishers is actually at p m it will be followed by q a and then after the speech and q a he ll attend a reception with the publishers and then return to washington from boston and that s it for the weekend q has the president seen the report from or the letter communication from the foreign service officers also obviously the communication from madeleine albright and what is his reaction to their call on him ms myers well obviously the letter was written to secretary christopher i believe secretary christopher received the letter on saturday he reviewed it and met with the authors on monday to discuss their views he believes it s an important part of the policy making process and is taking their views into account as we go forward in the development of the bosnia policy q what is the president s reaction ms myers the president hasn t seen the letter it was something that was directed towards secretary christopher in terms of he hasn t seen specifically the letter but in terms of their concerns generally what the president has said is that there are a lot of options on the table now including ones that weren t there before and i think he s as is everybody gravely concerned about the situation in bosnia q is he influenced by that i mean how does he feel about the fact that all of the specialists in that area those desk officers ms myers many of the specialists in that area i think that that is clearly part of the process it s something their views will clearly be considered i think secretary christopher met with the group immediately to discuss their views i think he believes that there ought to be room for opinions and that those opinions ought to be considered particularly from people who work closely on the issues q what do you mean there are options on the table that weren t there before ms myers i think the president said last week that there were options such as lifting the arms embargo to the bosnian muslims that had been previously off the table that are now being considered q dee dee in terms of those options madeleine albright is saying that potentially there could be unilateral action by the u s if the europeans did not go along is that on the table ms myers well i can t discuss anything that would any conversations that would have happened between ambassador albright and the president but i think the president has said he would certainly is working with our european allies he s had a number of conversations with european leaders and is trying to build some consensus there q will he reach a decision will he have anything specific to say today ms myers no i mean in term of there will be no new announcement of policy today q does your statement mean he has ruled out unilateral action ms myers he s continuing to consult with our allies at this point he has said i think he s been fairly clear about it that the he believes that the u s needs to act in concert with its allies on this q on that point does he believe that the u s though does have built in authority from the united nations already to take unilateral action ms myers well i think the u n resolution makes it clear that you can act unilaterally in support of any humanitarian relief effort i think the broader point is that anything we do any options that we decide to pursue we will make sure that it is consistent with u n authority and if it s not we ll work with our allies to make sure that we get it q dee dee then how does the white house someone as distinguished as elie wiesel who says that not enough is being done to stop the atrocities going on in bosnia ms myers i think that that s why we re considering additional options i think that mr wiesel s comments yesterday were quite compelling the situation in bosnia is tragic the president is very concerned about it he has i think president clinton has worked very hard to take further actions to continue to isolate serbia in the world community clearly we re considering other options because the president is concerned that perhaps it s not enough q in terms of what you were just talking about it sounds like resolution justifies unilateral action by the u s to protect humanitarian ms myers i don t think it i wouldn t use the word justify it permits unilateral action by any country in protecting the delivery of humanitarian relief but i think that s just an explanation of the resolution i think any action that we take will be consistent with u n resolutions or we ll work with our allies to make sure that it is permissible or we ll get further action q the president and other officials have ruled out unilateral u s action in bosnia in the past you re declining to do that this morning ms myers no i said the president has said repeatedly that he wants to act in concert with our allies on this q that doesn t mean that he won t act alone which has been said before explicitly ms myers i don t mean to imply a change in policy the president has said all along that he wants to act in concert with our allies on this q one other little question did he know about this letter from the foreign service officers before it hit the papers ms myers i don t believe so secretary christopher they may have had a private conversation about it the president has not seen it q they met on monday right christopher met surely he must have brought that up ms myers again they may have talked privately about it but q dee dee what you re saying is that the albright recommendation has been rejected is that correct ms myers no i didn t say that at all i said i won t i said i wouldn t comment on any conversations or communications q she s advocating unilateral action and you re saying in effect that we will not take unilateral action ms myers i am not confirming anything that madeleine albright may or may not have recommended q given the sometimes delicate complicated and frustrating nature of negotiations with the allies on this issue does the president find this kind of letter from foreign service officers of the state department helpful to that process hurtful to that ms myers i think that their views are obviously being considered the secretary received that memo on saturday and two days later he met with them in order to have a more thorough airing of their views of the basis for their views to discuss in greater detail the options that they had presented in the letter q doesn t it put some kind of pressure on additional pressure on him now from within his own administration to act regardless of what the allies may or may not do ms myers i think clearly there s a broad policy review underway now and the president and his advisors are considering a number of options including some of those outlined in the letter from the folks over at the state department now no decisions have been made on that yet but i think that there is a through review underway and that their opinions are being very seriously considered q if i can just follow up i guess what i m looking for is what was his reaction to this letter did he say good this bolsters my position or did he say damn this is just what i don t need right now ms myers i think he said this helps contribute substantively to the debate it s important that all views be considered and aired thoroughly that before he makes a decision he wants to have the best possible advice and information possible and this i think in many ways furthers that goal q so internal advice to a cabinet official or the president it s all open now and you wouldn t take any umbrage or say that they were out of line ms myers i think that the fact that secretary christopher met with them to discuss their views and make sure they had an opportunity to have a more complete conversation about it is conclusive evidence that their views are welcome q does the policy review include what madeleine albright has suggested and what joe biden and others have suggested which is that the previous u n resolutions authorize unilateral action military action for the delivery of humanitarian ms myers i think all options are on the table q the unilateral option is on the table ms myers i think all options are on the table q we ve had two different q isn t that a change dee dee q that would be a change of policy q particularly if it includes ground troops which has been specifically ruled out ms myers i think the president has been well no i don t that is not q are you talking about all options ms myers all options i think the president has been fairly clear about that so let me just review again what he has said he has said that the president has said all options are on the table with the exception of the introduction of ground troops which he has never suggested he has ruled that out from the beginning q hasn t he ruled out unilateral action of any sort ms myers he has said that he doesn t believe the u s can solve the problems in the former yugoslavia by itself i think that there are a number of very complicated options on the table right now i don t think that again i don t want to comment on specific options that are being considered other than in the broad categories that we ve already said things like lifting the arms embargo against the bosnian muslims things that i think we ve talked about in broad terms this is a very complicated situation the options being presented and considered are very complicated q air strikes on the table ms myers again i think that s been fairly clearly pointed out that that s something that s being discussed q dee dee are ground troops on the ms myers no ground troops are not being considered q you said there was not going to be you said you were not announcing a change of policy then you said everything is on the table we re confused are unilateral actions on the table ms myers all i can tell you is what the president has said that he doesn t believe that he wants to act in concert with the allies on this q wants to but he s willing to i mean if they don t go along ms myers he s continuing to consult with our allies on this he s continuing to have discussions he s continuing to press them for further action and i think that s clear the conversation is ongoing we re going to continue to work with them to find the best possible solution and next step on this q dee dee the allies have taken the position that to conduct any kind of air strikes in bosnia would have the opposite effect of ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid that they feel that their troops on the ground monitoring the delivery of that aid would become vulnerable and the bosnians ms myers i m not sure that s the consistent i mean i m not sure who you re referring to q the british and the french q yes the british and french they ve taken the position that the delivery of humanitarian aid would be jeopardized by any kind of air strikes against the bosnian military does the u s believe differently from that ms myers the president has had conversations with both mitterrand and major as you know i think that there is a thorough review of policy going on in those countries as well and i don t want to comment on the nature of the president s discussions other than to say that he s continuing to consult with our allies as we move forward and he s continuing to press them for further action and i think that process is ongoing q the other day voted against any military intervention yesterday does the president regard that as the end of the line or does he does still hold out some possibility of unilateral action the allies have been very very plain that they do not want to do anything ms myers the consultations are ongoing that s all i can tell you at this point q are you saying that there won t be any announcement on bosnia today in the press conference ms myers no that is not the intention of the press conference q what is the intention ms myers it s an opportunity to take questions he may have a brief i m sure he ll have a brief opening statement but it is not an opportunity to outline a new policy on bosnia that will not happen q can you tell us what the subject of the opening statement is ms myers it s sort of a general statement of where we are q after the first hundred days you mean ms myers it s not a long statement i mean this is just generally don t look for any major policy pronouncements q do you know what the opening statement is ms myers but it s perhaps later today i ll be able to tell you with more certainty i think that s still under review but the overriding purpose of this it s not a mystery it s not meant to be it s just to take questions q it would be helpful to know whether what the opening statement is on ms myers since the major purpose here is just to take questions it s not completely resolved yet q dee dee one policy that was expected last week and that the white house you and george seemed to indicate we might get would be an aids czar will he announce that today and what s the delay on that ms myers i don t think we meant to imply i think we said it would happen soon i don t think we meant to imply with any certainty that it would be this week it is coming soon i don t anticipate that happening today q what s the delay isn t this the perfect time to announce an aids czar ms myers i don t know that it s a delay i think the process is ongoing to find the best possible person and to go through the necessary background checks and to make sure that we ve crossed the t s and dotted the i s before we make an announcement q dee dee what are zoe baird s qualifications for the foreign intelligence advisory board and why wasn t her appointment announced here ms myers the qualifications i don t know if there s a specific list i ll have to check and see i think there are a number of people there on the board with different backgrounds many of them have long histories in intelligence or other government service i think there s a broad variety of views across political spectrum and across backgrounds that are represented there we never made a formal announcement other than the chairman of the board which is admiral william crowe q why would he appoint her though if the american people and many in the senate rejected her for another government job ms myers i don t believe that the american people ever had voted on her and i certainly she was never rejected in the senate she never went up there for a hearing but the president believes she s a very competent person he s said that zoe baird do you understand what the question is zoe baird is on the president s foreign intelligence q you said she never went up there for a hearing q her nomination was withdrawn after public outrage over violating federal laws ms myers right she never she was never but you said she was rejected by the senate i was just simply trying to point out that she was never voted on by the senate q so you don t think that is any problem ms myers i don t think there s any problem q she has been appointed to this board is that a fact ms myers yes q does she need confirmation for this does she need confirmation to be a member of the ms myers no it s a presidential appointment q usually announcements are made here at the white house was there a decision not to announce her publicly ms myers we didn t make an announcement people who asked were told who the members of the board were we didn t make an official announcement if anybody s interested in that we can certainly put out the list of names q i d like to know q don t such board members don t you normally as a matter of routinely put out releases on all these boards and presidential appointment regardless of their dimension ms myers not always but again i m happy to put this out q isn t that the standard practice q that was past practice ms myers again i m happy to put it out we ll put out a list of the members of the board today q dee dee i don t want to try to fail to let you get out of this swamp but laughter all i really want to know is hasn t it been the practice in this administration for such announcements to be made routinely ms myers i think generally but not always and we re happy to put that out today q what is the board what is her title what is the size of the board ms myers there is roughly a dozen members on the board it is a civilian board although their are some obviously retired military personnel on the board that provide input into intelligence policy for the president again the chairman of that board is admiral william crowe q and did he recommend baird q what s the name of the board ms myers it s the president s foreign intelligence advisory board pfiab q what s her qualification that she had employed an illegal alien is that laughter ms myers do you want an answer to the question or you just want to make a joke q let me phrase it another way why shouldn t this appointment be viewed as a pay back for the difficulty she had a couple of months ago ms myers because it s not q what s her experience in foreign intelligence ms myers she s an experienced attorney someone who the president believes is very competent and qualified and i think part of the mission of this board is to provide civilian input not everybody on the board is supposed to be an intelligence expert that is not the board s mission it is to provide civilian input for the president as he makes decisions regarding intelligence matters he believes she s very qualified very competent person enormously talented and has said that throughout q is this just a figment of my overactive imagination or was there discussion early on about abolishing the president s foreign intelligence advisory board ms myers i don t think so on december th when he announced all of his foreign policy advisors he announced that he would had appointed admiral crowe as the head of the board so i don t believe there s ever been any q earlier than that during the transition ms myers no i don t believe so it was announced again on december th admiral crowe couldn t be there but it was announced q are members paid ms myers i don t believe so but i ll double check q on another subject on waco how do you explain the discrepancy between the federal reports of the autopsies of the bodies that are coming out of waco and the state i guess it s the texas ranger reports ms myers most of the information is coming the federal information is coming from the site clearly there s been some discrepancies and the justice department is looking into it officials in the justice department were told i believe the day before yesterday that there were several bodies found with bullet holes i think there s some discrepancy about that and the justice department is looking into it q is the president going to get involved in trying to sort out what seems to be becoming a jurisdictional morass down there with some people withdrawing others saying they re in charge but others justice fbi texas rangers all grabbing a piece of this ms myers i don t know that he s going to try to mediate the dispute i mean i ll let you know if there s anything he intends to do about it but as you know there are several levels of investigation ongoing and we re hopeful that they can work together q is there any one agency or official down there in charge of everything ms myers i don t know i ll have to get back to you on that q what is the subject matter of sunday s speech ms myers it s going to be fairly general i don t think it s going to be any specific announcements i think it s going to be sort of a q does he have a topic that he s going to talk about ms myers we re still working on it but i wouldn t look for any announcements of like the drug czar or something like that q is it sort of a days speech sort of my excellent adventure for days laughter ms myers not exactly but i think he ll take a little bit broader look about what s happened in the last q foreign domestic ms myers a little bit of both but i think a lot of domestic q and overview ms myers yes more of an overview than a specific policy announcement q has there been an agreement yet on a forum by which the president will address the gay rights march on sunday ms myers it will be a letter read to the crowd by congresswoman nancy pelosi q is that available ms myers not yet but it will be sure q are you going to put it out here or ms myers we ll probably put it out here on sunday q travel next week ms myers unclear q what was the question q likely ms myers i don t q likely possible ms myers possible q what s possible ms myers travel q george mentioned yesterday campaign finance reform and national service legislative proposals next week do you have days yet for them ms myers not yet q can you tell us which order ms myers campaign finance reform first national service later in the week q is there any coverage tomorrow in williamsburg ms myers no q and any report in the aftermath of the day ms myers any readout from the day q readout ms myers it s possible jeff eller will be down there i think he can go through what the president did during the day we don t expect any photo op or anything other than departure here in the morning q dee dee the president has not made a regular practice as some of his predecessors have of going to camp david in fact he s been there what once or twice ms myers twice q why this weekend ms myers he went two weekends ago as you know on the way home from his father in law s funeral i think that they found it to be a good experience and a nice way for them to spend some time together as a family and this is just an opportunity to do the same q there s no march there q it has nothing to do with the march here ms myers no q since he s going to be in town sunday morning now instead of in jamestown have you thought about him making a quick pass by fly over laughter ms myers he ll fly straight to boston q flying straight did you say laughter q george took a question yesterday on waco the president had said on tuesday in the rose garden that there was a minor disagreement on tactics between the military advisors and the fbi and the question was whether you knew exactly what that was and whether it related to the use of the particular kind of tear gas do you have an answer on that ms myers i don t i ll check the press thank you end a m edt

clinton president s press conference the white house office of the press secretary for immediate release april press conference by the president the east room p m edt the president terry do you have a question q mr president there s a growing feeling that the western response to bloodshed in bosnia has been woefully inadequate holocaust survivor elie wiesel asked you yesterday to do something anything to stop the fighting is the united states considering taking unilateral action such as air strikes against serb artillery sites the president well first let me say as you know for more than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for further action and i want to say too let s look at the last three months since i became president i have worked with our allies and we have tried to move forward first on the no fly zone on enforcement of it on the humanitarian airdrops on the war crimes investigation on getting the bosnian muslims involved in the peace process we have made some progress and now we have a very much tougher sanctions resolution and leon fuerth who is the national security advisor to the vice president is in europe now working on implementing that that is going to make a big difference to serbia and we are reviewing other options i think we should act we should lead the united states should lead we have led for the last three months we have moved the coalition and to be fair our allies in europe have been willing to do their part and they have troops on the ground there but i do not think we should act alone unilaterally nor do i think we will have to and in the next several days i think we will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and which has taken a lot of my time as well as the time of the administration as it should have over the last days or so i think we ll finish that in the near future and then we ll have a policy and we ll announce it and everybody can evaluate it q can i follow up the president sure q do you see any parallel between the ethnic cleansing in bosnia and the holocaust the president i think the holocaust is on a whole different level i think it is without precedent or peer in human history on the other hand ethnic cleansing is the kind of inhumanity that the holocaust took to the nth degree the idea of moving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely because of their ethnicity is an abhorrent thing and it is especially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic groups live side by side for so long together and i think you have to stand up against it i think it s wrong we were talking today about all of the other troubles in that region i was happy to see the violence between the croats and the muslims in bosnia subside this morning and i think we re making progress on that front but what s going on with the serbians and the ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other conflicts both within the former yugoslavia and in other parts of the region q mr president by any count you have not had a good week in your presidency the tragedy in waco the defeat of your stimulus bill the standoff in bosnia what did you do wrong and what are you going to do differently how do you look at things are you reassessing laughter the president i don t really believe that the situation in bosnia it s not been a good week for the world but i don t know that the administration could have made it different on the stimulus package i d like to put it into the larger context and remind you that in this days we have already fundamentally changed the direction of an american government we have abandoned trickle down economics we ve abandoned the policies that brought the debt of this country from trillion to trillion in only a decade the budget plan which passed the congress which will reduce the deficit and increase investment has led to a year low in mortgage rates dramatically lower interest rates there are probably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages in the last three months or who have had access to cheaper credit that s going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this economy in ways that are very very good for the country and so we are moving in the right direction economically i regret that the stimulus did not pass and i have begun to ask and will continue to ask not only people in the administration but people in the congress whether there is something i could have done differently to pass that part of the reason it didn t pass was politics part of it was a difference in ideas there are really people still who believe that it s not needed i just disagree with that i think the recovery the economists say it s been underway for about two years and we ve still had months of seven percent unemployment and all the wealthy countries are having trouble creating jobs so i think there was an idea base an argument there that while we re waiting for the lower interest rates and the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years to take effect this sort of supplemental appropriation should go forward now i have to tell you i did misgauge that because a majority of the republican senators now sitting in the senate voted for a similar stimulus when ronald reagan was president in and voted times for regular supplemental appropriations like this i just misgauged it and i hope that i can learn something i ve just been here days and you know i was a governor working with a contentious legislature for years and it took me a decade to get political reform there so it takes time to change things but i basically feel very good about what s happened in the first days with regard to the congress q waco the president well with regard to waco i don t have much to add to what i ve already said i think it is a i want the situation looked into i want us to bring in people who have any insights to bear on that i think it s very important that the whole thing be thoroughly gone over but i still maintain what i said from the beginning that the offender there was david koresh and i do not think the united states government is responsible for the fact that a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves and i m sorry that they killed their children q mr president to follow up partly on helen on your stimulus package and on your political approach to capitol hill ross perot said today that you re playing games with the american people in your tax policy he was strongly critical of your stimulus package he said he s going to launch an advertising campaign against the north american free trade agreement how are you going to handle his political criticism will it complicate your efforts on the hill with your economic plan and do you plan to repackage some of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to resubmit them to the hill the president let me answer that question first we re going to revisit all of that over the next few days i m going to be talking to members of congress and to others to see what we can do about that with regard to the economic plan i must say i found that rather amazing i don t want to get into an argument with mr perot i ll be interested to hear what his specifics are but i would go back and read his book and his plan there s a remarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts we raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy but otherwise the plans are remarkably similar so i think it would be i ll be interested to see if maybe perhaps he s changed his position from his book last year and he has some new ideas to bring to bear i ll be glad to hear them q to follow up sir how do you plan to handle his political criticism he s launched a campaign against you do you think you can sit back and just the president well first of all i will ask you to apply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me and if he s changed his position from the positions he took in the campaign last year then we need to know why and what his ideas are maybe he s got some constructive ideas i think the american people have shown that they re very impatient with people who don t want to produce results and the one thing i think that everybody has figured out about me in the last even if they don t agree with what i do is that i want to get something done i just came here to try to change things i want to do things and i want to do things that help people s lives so my judgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good that is constructive that takes us beyond some idea i ve proposed that will change people s lives for the better fine but i think that that ought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this debate and not just to the president q mr president to go back to bosnia for a minute you continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action a criteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many options thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of paralysis the united states is the last remaining superpower why is it not appropriate in this situation for the united states to act unilaterally the president well the united states surely you would agree that the united states even as the last remaining superpower has to act consistent with international law under some mandate of the united nations q but you have a mandate and the president they do and that is one of the things that we have under review i haven t ruled out any option for action i would remind all of you i have not ruled out any option except that we have not discussed and we are not considering the introduction of american forces into continuing hostilities there we are not so we are reviewing other options but i also would remind you that to be fair our allies have had the french the british and the canadians have had troops on the ground there they have been justifiably worried about those but they have supported the airdrops the toughening of the sanctions they welcomed the american delegation now in europe working on how to make these sanctions really work and really bite against serbia and i can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely reassessing their position and i would not rule out the fact that we can reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where we have been i don t have any criticism of the british the french and others about that q would that be military action q mr president several of the leading lights in your administration ranging from your fbi director to your u n ambassador to your deputy budget director to your health services secretary have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which are absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you ve taken in your administration why is that are you losing your political grip the president give me an example q example judge sessions said that there was no child abuse in waco madeleine albright has said in this morning s newspapers at least that she favors air strikes in bosnia all of these are things you said that you didn t support the president first of all i don t know what we know that david koresh had sex with children i think that is undisputed is it not is it not does anybody dispute that where i come from that qualifies as child abuse and we know that he had people teaching these kids how to kill themselves i think that qualifies as abuse and i m not criticizing judge sessions because i don t know exactly what he said in terms of madeleine albright madeleine albright has made no public statement at all about air strikes there is a press report that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed her or memo in which she expressed her views about the new direction we should take in response to my request to all the senior members of my administration to let me know what they thought we ought to do next and i have heard from her and from others about what they think we ought to do next and i m not going to discuss the recommendations they made to me but in the next few days when i make a decision about what to do then i will announce what i m going to do so i wouldn t say that either one of those examples qualifies speaking out of school q how about the value added tax mr president the president what was that q the value added tax mrs rivlin and miss shalala both said that they thought that that was a good idea the president i don t mind them saying they think it s a good idea there are all kinds of arguments for it on policy grounds that does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it in the health care debate no decision has been made on that and i have no objection to their expressing their views on that we ve had a lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they thought that tax would help make their particular industries more competitive in the global economy i took no that wasn t taking a line against an administration policy q mr president a week ago a group of gay and lesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed in the most ringing terms their confidence in your understanding of them and their political aspirations and their belief that you would fulfill those aspirations do you feel now that you will be able to meet their now enhanced expectations the president well i don t know about that and i don t know what their it depends on what the expectations are but i ll tell you this i believe that this country s policies should be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination i believe when you tell people they can t do certain things in this country that other people can do there ought to be an overwhelming and compelling reason for it i believe we need the services of all of our people and i have said that consistently and not as a political proposition the first time this issue came up was in when i was in boston i was just asked the question about it and i might add it s interesting that i have been attacked obviously those who disagree with me here are primarily coming from the political right in america when i was governor i was attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights of religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to practice home schooling under appropriate safeguards i just have always had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect the rights of american individual citizens to live up to the fullest of their capacities and i m going to stick right with that q are you concerned sir that you may have generated expectations on their end and criticism among others that has hamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis on this issue the president yes but i have not placed a great deal of emphasis on it it s gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters and in the press i ve just simply taken my position and tried to see it through and that s what i do it doesn t take a lot of my time as president to say what i believe in and what i intend to do and that s what i ll continue to do q mr president getting back to the situation in bosnia and we understand you haven t made any final decisions on new options previously considered unacceptable but the two most commonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable the bosnian muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited air strikes perhaps to cut off supply lines without telling us your decision presumably you haven t made any final decisions on those two options what are the pros and cons that are going through your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final decision the president i m reluctant to get into this there are those are two of the options there are some other options that have been considered all have pluses and minuses all have supporters and opponents within the administration and in the congress where i would remind you heavy consultations will be required to embark on any new policy i do believe that on the air strike issue the pronouncements that general powell has made generally about military action apply there if you take action if the united states takes action we must have a clearly defined objective that can be met we must be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear the united states is not should not become involved as a partisan in a war with regard to the lifting of the arms embargo the question obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to fight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace will it lead to more bloodshed what kind of reaction can others have that would undermine the effectiveness of the policy but i think both of them deserve some serious consideration along with some other options we have q do you think that these people who are trying to get us into war in bosnia are really remembering that we haven t taken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and we couldn t take care of our prisoners and get them all home from vietnam and now many of them are coming up with bills for treatment of agent orange how can we afford to go to any more of these wars the president well i think that s a good argument against the united states itself becoming involved as a belligerent in a war there but we are after all the world s only super power we do have to lead the world and there is a very serious problem of systematic ethnic cleansing in the former yugoslavia which could have not only enormous further humanitarian consequences and goodness knows there have been many but also could have other practical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts of ethnic tensions exist q did you make any kind of agreement with boris yeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive action against the serbs until after sunday and in general how has his political situation affected your deliberation on bosnia the president no i have not made any agreement and he did not ask for that we never even discussed that interestingly enough the russians i would remind you in the middle of president yeltsin s campaign abstained from our attempt to get tougher sanctions through the united nations in what i thought was the proper decision for them and one that the united states and i m sure the rest of the free world very much appreciated q do you wish mr president that you d become more involved in the planning of the waco operation and how would you handle that situation differently now the president i don t think as a practical matter that the president should become involved in the planning of those kinds of things at that detail one of the things that i m sure will come out when we look into this is the questions will be asked and answered did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions we should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten and i look forward to that but at the time i have to say as i did before the first thing i did after the atf agents were killed once we knew that the fbi was going to go in was to ask that the military be consulted because of the quasi as least military nature of the conflict given the resources that koresh had in his compound and their obvious willingness to use them and then on the day before the action i asked the questions of the attorney general which i have reported to you previously and which at the time i thought were sufficient i have as i said i m sure i leave it to others to make the suggestions about whether there are other questions i should have asked q mr president what is your assessment of director sessions role in the waco affair and have you made a decision on his future and if you haven t will you give him a personal hearing before you do decide the president well first of all i have no assessment of his role since i had no direct contact with him and i mean no negative or positive inference i have no assessment there i stand by what i said before about my general high regard for the fbi and i m waiting for a recommendation from the attorney general about what to do with the direction of the fbi q mr president since you said that one side in bosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the holocaust carried to the nth degree why do you then tell us that the united states cannot take a partisan view in this war the president well i said that the principle of ethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against that does not mean that the united states or the united nations can enter a war in effect to redraw the lines geographical lines of republics within what was yugoslavia or that that would ultimately be successful i think what the united states has to do is to try to figure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the people to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop ethnic cleansing and that is obviously the difficulty we are wrestling with this is clearly the most difficult foreign policy problem we face and that all of our allies face and if it were easy i suppose it would have been solved before we have tried to do more in the last days than was previously done it has clearly not been enough to stop the serbian aggression and we are now looking at what else we can do q yesterday you specifically criticized the roosevelt administration for not having bombed the railroads to the concentration camps and things that were near military targets aren t there steps like that that would not involve conflict direct conflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider the president there may be i would remind you that the circumstances were somewhat different we were then at war with germany at the time and that s what made that whole incident so series of incidents so perplexing but we have as i say we ve got all of our options under review q the diplomatic initiative on haiti is on the verge of collapse what can you do to salvage it short of a full scale military operation the president well you may know something i don t that s not what our people tell me i think mr caputo and ambassador pezzullo have done together a good job the thing keeps going back and forth because of the people who are involved with the de facto government there it s obvious what their concerns are they were the same concerns that led to the ouster of aristide in the first place and president aristide we feel should be restored to power we re working toward that i get a report on that we discuss it at least three times a week and i m convinced that we re going to prevail there and be successful i do believe that there s every reason to think that there will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to guarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on both sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of ongoing civilized society but i believe we re going to prevail there q mr president would you care to make your assessment of the first days before we make one for you laughter the president well i ll say if i believe first of all we passed the budget resolution in record time that was the biggest issue that confirmed the direction of the administration and confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both bring the deficit down and increase investment and that we could do it by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes almost all of which come from the highest income people in this society reversing a year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the middle class whose incomes were going down when their taxes were going up while the deficit went from trillion to trillion the total national debt and the deficit continued to go up we have a year low in interest rates from mortgages we have lower interest rates across the board we have tens of billions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people refinance their debt we have established a new environmental policy which is dramatically different the secretary of education has worked with me and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach in education that focuses on tough standards as well as increasing opportunity we have done an enormous amount of work on political reform on campaign finance and lobbying reform and i have imposed tough ethics requirements on my own administration s officials these things are consistent with not only what i said i d do in the campaign but with turning the country around the vice president is heading a task force which will literally change the way the federal government operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens of this country we are working on a whole range of other things the welfare reform initiative to move people from welfare to work and of course a massive amount of work has been done on the health care issue which is a huge economic and personal security problem for millions of americans so i think it is amazing how much has been done more will be done we also passed the family leave bill a version of the motor voter bill that has not come out of conference back to me yet and everything has been passed except the stimulus program so i think we re doing fine and we re moving in the right direction i feel good about it q sir a follow up wouldn t you say though that one of your biggest initiatives aid to soviet russia is now practically finished if we can t pass a stimulus bill in our own country how can we do it for them the president let me recast the question a little bit it s a good question laughter it s a good question but to be fair we ve got to recast it we have already the first round of aid to the soviet to non soviet russia to a democratic russia is plainly going to go through the first billion the aid that we agreed with our partners in the g to provide through the international financial institutions which is a big dollar item is plainly going to go through the question is can we get any more aid for russia that requires a new appropriation by the united states congress and that is a question i think mary that will be resolved in the weeks ahead in part by what happens to the american workers and their jobs and their future i think the two things will be tied by many members of congress q the tailhook report came out this morning documenting horrendous and nearly criminal conduct on the part of the navy how much did you discuss the incident and what might be done about it with your nominee to be the secretary of the navy the president first let me comment a little on that the inspector general s report details conduct which is wrong and which has no place in the armed services and i expect the report to be acted on in the appropriate way i also want to say to the american people and to all of you that the report should be taken for what it is a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to be thoroughly examined it should not be taken as a general indictment of the united states navy or of all the fine people who serve there it is very specific in its allegations and it will be pursued the only thing i said to the secretary designate of the navy and the only thing i should have said to him i think is that i expected him to take the report and to do his duty and i believe he will do that q mr president to back to russia for just a minute the latest poll show that mr yeltsin will probably win his vote of confidence but there seems to be a real toss up on whether or not voters are going to endorse his economic reforms the president i understand that q can you live with a split laughter can you live with a split decision though or do you need both passed in order to then build support for russian aid the president i believe the answer to your question is for the united states the key question should be that which is posed to any democracy which is who wins the election if he wins the election if he is ratified by the russian people to continue as their president then i think we should do our best to work with him toward reform you know we had a lot of other countries here for the holocaust museum dedication their leaders were here leaders from eastern europe leaders from at least one republic of the former soviet union all of them having terrible economic challenges as they convert from a communist command and control economy to a market economy in a world where there s economic slowdown everywhere and in a world in which there s economic slowdown and difficulty all leaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll because they haven t produced the results that the people so earnestly yearn for you can understand that but if they have confidence in the leadership i think that s all we can ask and the united states will if the russian people ratify him as their president and stick with him then the united states will continue to work with him i think he is a genuine democrat small d and genuinely committed to reform i think that we should support that q mr president mr perot has come out strongly in what is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement nafta how hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement and when do you expect to see it accomplished the president i think we ll have the agreement ready in the fairly near future you know our people are still working with the mexican government and with the canadians on the side agreements we re trying to work out what the environmental agreement will say what the labor agreement will say and then what the fairest way to deal with enforcement is the mexicans say and there is some merit to their position that they re worried about transferring their sovereignty in enforcement to a multilateral commission even in the united states to be fair we have some folks who are worried about that about giving that up on the other hand if we re going to have an environmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means something then there has to be ultimately some consequences for violating them so what we re trying to do is to agree on an approach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations if you keep on violating it past a certain point maybe not an isolated incident but a pattern of violation there is going to be some enforcement there must be consequences and we re working out the details of that but i still feel quite good about it and this is just an area where i disagree with mr perot and with others i think that we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more closely the mexican economy and the american economy and leads us from there to chile to other market economies in latin america and gives us a bigger world in which to trade i think that s the only way a rich country can grow richer if you look at what japan and other countries in the pacific are doing to reach out in their own region it s a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry about how to build those bridges in our own area so this is an idea battle you know you ve got a lot of questions and i want to answer them all but let me say not every one of these things can be distilled simply into politics you know who s for this and who s for that and if this person is for this somebody else has got to be for that a lot of these things honestly involved real debates over ideas over who s right and wrong about the world toward which we re moving and the answers are not self evident and one of the reasons that i wanted to run for president is i wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating these ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way so i just have a difference of opinion i believe that the concept of nafta is sound even though as you know i thought that the details needed to be improved q mr president there was a tremendous flurry of interest earlier this month in the russian document that purported to show that the vietnamese had held back american prisoners general vessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was authentic he believes that it was incorrect do you have a personal view at this point about that issue and more broadly do you believe that in fact the vietnamese did return all the american prisoners at the time of the paris peace accord the president first let me say i saw general vessey before he went to vietnam and after he returned and i have a high regard for him and i appreciate his willingness to serve his country in this way as to whether the document had any basis in fact let me say that the government of vietnam was more forthcoming than it had been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to undermine the validity of the russian documents claim i do not know whether that is right or wrong we are having it basically evaluated at this time and when we complete the evaluation we ll tell you and of course we want to tell the families of those who were missing in action or who were pows i think that we ll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of the questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last interchange but i cannot say that i m fully satisfied that we know all that we need to know there are still some cases that we don t know the answer to but i do believe we re making some progress i was encouraged by the last trip q i d like to follow up on that before the u s normalizes relations allows trade to go forward do you have to be personally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be willing to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to resolve these cases the vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to us to confirm good faith the president a lot of experts say you can never resolve every case every one that we couldn t resolve all the cases for them and that there are still some cases that have not been factually resolved going back to the second world war but what i would have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward resolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time and that there was a complete open and unrestricted commitment to continue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving those cases and we re not there yet again i have to be guided a little bit by people who know a lot about this and i confess to being much more heavily influenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there or whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and the other things which seem so compelling in this moment i just am very influenced by how the families feel q your economic stimulus package are you doing some kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans your legislative plans for the coming year including the crime bill the health care initiative and other things are there any plans to do that and also did you underestimate the power of senator bob dole the president no what i underestimated was the extent to which what i thought was a fairly self evident case particularly after we stayed below the spending caps approved by this congress including the republicans who were in this congress last year when we had already passed a budget resolution which called for over billion in deficit reduction when they had voted repeatedly for supplemental appropriations to help foreign governments i thought at least four of them would vote to break cloture and i underestimated that i did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that i also thought that if i made a good faith effort to negotiate and to compromise that it would not be rebuffed instead every time i offered something they reduced the offer that they had previously been talking to the majority leader about so it was a strange set of events but i think what happened was what was a significant part of our plan but not the major part of it acquired a political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits so that a lot of republicans were saying to me privately mr president i d like to be for this but i can t now and we re all strung out and we re divided and i think we need to do a reality check as i said what i want to know let me go back to what i said what i want to know from our folks and from our friends in the senate on and republicans or democrats is what could i have done differently to make it come out differently because the real losers here were not the president and the administration the real losers were the hundreds of thousands of people who won t have jobs now we could have put another kids to work this summer i mean we could have done a lot of good things with that money and i think that is very very sad and it became more political than it should have but the underlying rationale i don t think holds a lot of water that it was deficit spending that just won t wash q and redo the president no i mean you know for example you mentioned the crime bill i think it would be a real mistake not to pass the crime bill i mean the crime bill was almost on the point of passage last year and they were all fighting over the brady bill surely surely after what we have been through in this country just in the last three months with the kind of mindless violence we have seen we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a waiting period before they buy a handgun and surely we can see that we need more police officers on the street that s another thing that i really believe that once we move some of that money not all but some of it up into this jobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the street who d been laid off that would be a compelling case i mean people are scared in this country and i think we need to go forward i feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill q mr president back to the tailhook report for a second that report contained very strong criticism of the navy s senior leadership in general but did not name any of the senior officers do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated in this including admiral kelso who was there one night in las vegas should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a right to know the names of the senior officers the president you should know that under the rules of law which apply to this i am in the chain of command there is now an inspector general s report and the law must take its course if i were to answer that question i might prejudice any decisions which might be later made in this case i don t really think i think all i can tell you is what i have already said i was very disturbed by the specific allegations in the inspector general s report and i want appropriate action to be taken until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and appropriate action is taken i have been advised that because i am the commander in chief i have to be very careful about what i say so as not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action might proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or con so i can t say any more except to say that i want this thing handled in an appropriate and thorough way q mr president could i ask you for a clarification on bosnia you said that you were not considering introduction of american forces does that include any air forces as well as ground forces sir the president i said ground forces q you said ground forces could i ask you sir if you fear that using u s air strikes might draw the united states into a ground war there the president i just don t want to discuss our evaluation of the options anymore i ve told you that there s never been a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of ground forces into an ongoing conflict there q with hundreds of thousands of gays in washington this weekend for the march did you ever reconsider your decision to leave town for this weekend did you ever consider in any way participating in some of the activities the president no q why not the president because i and basically i wouldn t participate in other marches i think once you become president on balance except under unusual circumstances that is not what should be done but more importantly i m going to the american society of newspaper editors a trip that presumably most of you would want me to make to try to focus anew on what i think are the fundamental issues at stake for our country right now and i expect that i will say something about the fact that a lot of americans have come here asking for a climate that is free of discrimination asking basically to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be treated like other american citizens if they do that and just that and that s always been my position not only for the gays who will be here but for others as well thank you very much end p m edt

re clayton is an asshole but we all already know that here s a hypothetical question if clayton said something like all those niggers are really stupid please don t be offended i m not racist but merely using an example of clayton s malign logic and then said he read a report that a lot of blacks in inner cities dropped out of school i bet he wouldn t have your support yet he can claim that all homosexuals are dishonest evil lying child molesters without personally having a single homosexual friend or acquaintance and you ll sit there and support him god created a place for bigots it s called hell and clayton is going to burn there for a long time i pray for him to find in his heart the christian values he espouses so that he can learn to love his gay brothers and sisters because anyone with so much hatred in his soul coulld never be righteous there is a difference between supporting claytons opinions and supporting his right to speak i want you to know that you cannot educate and or elevate ones understanding by calling him names clayton has an opinion which in his mind is as valid as any opinion anyone else on the net has if you were to walk up to black person to talk about blacks in the inner city and began the conversation with those niggers in th you would lose the attention of that black person by the time you spoke your second word all name calling and derisive remarks do is turn off the audience you are trying to address clayton is guilty of that and as such has distracted attention away from his message to bits and pieces of his conversation i don t understand why people want to repeat his mistakes rogerd netcom com rogerd aqm com hanging by the tips of my finger at the edge of the internet
re waco in article c u a bfh cbnews cb att com ddn cbnews cb att com david d nason writes thirdly it seems incredibly hypocritical to place blame given the benefit of hindsight something that those who made the decisions did not have the benefit of why not give them the courtesy of acknowledging that they did the best they could with the data they had in a very very difficult situation what is your proof that they did the best they could unless they had strong evidence that the children were in immediate danger then the best they could have done was to show restraint some of us did predict this outcome or at least suggested a strong possibility of it i for one said that in the event of an assault against the building the children were the ones in danger either from the assault itself or from a jonestown my phrase a week after the seige started style suicide and as i pointed out then and repeatedly over the objections of people on the net who disagreed with me an adult may freely choose suicide but they have no right to impose this choice on their children now while i don t expect the fbi to pay any attention to what i have to say on this i do expect them to figure it out on their own or to take the advice of experts the cult specialist inter viewed in yesterday s boston globe said he was repeatedly stonewalled by the fbi when he pointed out to them that their confrontational tactics played perfectly into koresh s mad view of the world and so increased the chance of a tragic outcome some responses have gone so far to suggest that the actions were done without regard for the lives of the people in the compound give me a break give us a break pumping teargas for minutes into a compound filled with children this doesn t seem to show much regard for their lives or safety nontoxic teargas is an oxymoron children have tiny respiratory passages which are easily blocked by the secretions induced by teargas moreover teargas can easily cause fatalities in anyone subject to laryngospasms asthma or heart disease if a madman is holding a gun to a hostage someone who provokes the madman by attacking him bears nearly as much repsonsibility for the death of the hostage as the madman himself these kinds of situations have to be handled delicately not by surrounding a place with tanks and heavily armed personnel and blaring rock music from loud speakers at all hours that approach is idiotic be part of the solution not the problem the solution is to greatly reduce the authority of the the authorities the feds showed themselves here as they have so many times in the past to be a gang of trigger happy impulsive yahoos who cause more trouble than they prevent their confrontational approach reinforced every single message koresh was giving his followers virtually guarantee ing that whatever crazy solution koresh proposed would be followed willingly this was pointed out here on compuserve in the press just about every place except in the justice department where it seems a n i h philosophy prevails peter

re abolish selective service in article visser convex convex com visser convex com lance visser writes dave borden borden head cfa harvard edu wrote the selective service registration should be abolished to start with the draft is immoral whether you agree with that or not we don t have one now and military experts agree that the quality of the armed forces is superior with a volunteer army than with draftees finally the government has us on many lists in many computers the irs social security admistration and motor vehicle registries to name a few and it can find us if it needs to maintaining yet another list of people is an utter waste of money and time let s axe this whole department and reduce the deficit a little bit more gridlock talk from another relic of the past the selective service system creates jobs and is an investment in the future of america and whats wrong with that do we want to create jobs or do we want jobs created that are productive in our supply demand economy if your answer is the former then we can just round up all jobless people and pay them to build sandcastles in the desert if you answer the latter then i fail to see how another bureaucracy produces anything we need jobs because at this point in the recovery the economy should have generated billion jobs and since it has not the government has to step in and help shutting down selective service would cost good jobs and we can t do that what we really need is to involve selective service in a more closely directed manner we need the selective service involved in environmental protection high speed rail commuter aircraft civil rights national service and health care every dollar we put into selective service now will get us less spending in future i really believe now to think about it that selective service is long past due for the creation of a cabinet position your not beyond hope just get back on america s side and start doing your part for change what bill needs from you now is support for the economic stimulus and health care reform you need to devote all your energies to fighting gridlock and supporting change get on the team after all the evil has been banished from washington and the time for complaint is past being neccessary and remember bill clinton cares he may someday even have a town meeting in your city if your an appropriate sort of person if you phrase your questions properly and show the proper respect and awe you might have the chance to ask mr president your question in person oh i get it this is sarcastic right
re new study out on gay percentage in article bu edu kane buast bu edu hot young star writes in article optilink com cramer optilink com clayton cramer writes homosexuals lie about the number to hide the disproportionate involvement of homosexuals in child molestation they also lie about to keep politicians scared you haven t shown any disproportionate involvement the janus report which came out recently gives as the percentage of exclusively or predominantly gay men i thumbed through the janus report in a bookstore recently looking for a clue about their methodology they were very unclear about it but as far as i could tell they relied on their professional associates in the psychotherapy profession to provide the subjects interviews and numbers if so this would hardly represent an average cross section i posted to usenet at the time asking for more data about their methodology but answer came there none i must have been out of my mind for even asking for factual information on usenet no one is presumably going to say they re gay if they re not but some no doubt are going to hide their homosexuality in surveys thus the is a lower limit this is the problem people have to have a lot of confidence in the anonymity of a study before they can counted on to speak freely about stuff like that but i agree that if someone s going to lie it will be in the direction of a gay person claiming to be straight rather than the other way around i still say that weighing all the evidence gives a most likely percentage between and i don t see why there s any more evidence for this figure than any other it seems totally arbitrary peter

clinton press briefing by george stephanopoulos the white house office of the press secretary for immediate release april press briefing by george stephanopoulos the briefing room p m edt mr stephanopoulos as you know the president is going to come out at p m with your indulgence i think what we d like to do is have the president award the national teacher s award first and then have the teacher leave or whatever and then he ll make a statement on waco and take a couple questions so if we can just hold off going live and all that until that s done it probably will work out a lot better q if you ll give us the time that s the problem q we ve got a two minute warning problem mr stephanopoulos yes it is a problem it s about p m q the teacher would walk off and then mr stephanopoulos i think that s i m just trying to work this out here i think that s the best way to handle it q can i ask you a series of questions about the way the president handled the notifications yesterday mr stephanopoulos sure q did you for instance talk to the justice department about who would come out and discuss what had happened in waco and whether it should be the attorney general or the president mr stephanopoulos why don t we just take a step even farther back from that and look at the whole sequence of events on the contact between the justice department and the white house as you know and as we ve said the president spoke with the attorney general on sunday sunday afternoon they had a good discussion about minutes the attorney general informed the president of what she wanted to do he raised no objections obviously she had the implicit authority from the president to go forward he raised no objections she went forward they had a discussion of a general nature about the incident again yesterday morning around a m the president spoke with the attorney general again they had a brief discussion over what was happening in waco as you know this was before the fire broke out at the compound and i think that was why there was some just some confusion i think that she was confusing in her minds before and after the fire not the actual day when they spoke then there was a number of contacts at a number of different levels in the white house yesterday afternoon between the justice department and the white house they were informing us of their decisions what they would like to do there was an fbi briefing in waco the attorney general had her press conference the president then issued a statement after that frankly yesterday afternoon you know there was a fair amount of confusion over exactly what was happening on the ground in waco and i think that we wanted to be very careful not to have the president say anything until we had a much better sense of what was actually happening on the ground once we were fairly clear on what was happening on the ground in waco the president issued a statement he spoke with the attorney general again yesterday evening q at what hour was that mr stephanopoulos it was quite late i believe it was after he returned from the holocaust museum he took a tour of the holocaust museum last night q and he went out to dinner mr stephanopoulos i believe briefly yes he went to dinner and then he spoke with the attorney general last night i don t know the exact time i think it was relatively late and he just said i think as dee dee has reported that he just wanted to tell her that he thought she handled a difficult situation very well that she did a good job in a tough situation and that she should try and get some sleep he then again spoke with her this morning about the follow up in waco and about what they re going to do this afternoon as you know the president will have an announcement to make at q did he ever talk with webb hubbell yesterday last night or this morning mr stephanopoulos not to my knowledge no q was webb hubbell the point man for the white house mr stephanopoulos webb hubbell is the general white house liaison and several people talked to webb the attorney general was running the operation q did he tell her that she should sleep well that she had done a good job or he just tell her that she should get some sleep mr stephanopoulos i think sleep well done a good job i don t know the exact words i think that sounds right q i mean sleep well has implications as to conscience and whether she should feel badly about it or not mr stephanopoulos well i mean i think everybody feels badly when you have a situation when q i understand that but whether the issue of blame is brought up in that phraseology mr stephanopoulos i think that s the spirit no it has nothing to do with that the spirit with which it was offered was that the entire administration and certainly the attorney general had to face a very difficult decision a very difficult situation yesterday and that he thought that she had handled it well as best as she could and q well does he think it was mishandled mr stephanopoulos it was just speaking of warm words to a friend q does he think the situation was mishandled mr stephanopoulos the president q in retrospect mr stephanopoulos the president stands by the decisions of the law enforcement agencies the decisions of the attorney general he accepts full responsibility at the same time i think that we all want to look to the future and figure out what exactly happened do a full review and make sure we do what we can to make sure this doesn t happen this kind of thing doesn t happen again or at least we know how to handle it q how much did he know about what she was going to go ahead with i know that she made the case to him explained outlined the case for action did she say to him on sunday precisely what action mr stephanopoulos i don t think it was specific operational detail as to what was going to happen i think that they had a general discussion about the action about the advisability of action i think as she noted he asked a few general questions just trying to get a sense of how things were considered but it wasn t minute by minute detail of how the operation q well was it we are going in is it we re going to use tear gas i mean what mr stephanopoulos i believe it was that we want to go in and take some action that would increase the pressure on those in the compound and hopefully spur them towards some sort of movement out q george was there ever a conscious political decision made or even a discussion about distancing the president from mr stephanopoulos not at all i mean we were in close contact with the justice department the president accepts responsibility for this at the same time i mean we just wanted to be very very clear about how this happened and be as factual as we could be on how the decisions were made it is the responsibility of those on the ground to make recommendations the attorney general has operational control over this the president obviously accepts responsibility for all of this and he stands by the attorney general q george there was a report on the television today and i don t know more than that one of the members of the cult had said going into a courthouse that the fbi had started the fire and not themselves there was also a picture yesterday on the tv of a smashing into the building where the fire broke out and my question is is the white house absolutely certain that this fire was mr stephanopoulos all the evidence we have is that this fire was started by david koresh and those inside the compound every bit of evidence we have q did the president ask the attorney general why do this now why this particular date and did he ask about possible consequences of either death or injury mr stephanopoulos i don t know the specific questions he had general questions about how the decision was going about being made q those are general questions and did he ask generally why now mr stephanopoulos i think he asked have you considered all of the consequences have you considered the recommendations i don t know if he asked the question why now i don t know if he asked that specific question q did she tell him why now in terms of the stuff that s come out since then about the information provided by the listening device about koresh getting increasingly more violent mr stephanopoulos again i m not certain how much specific detail they got into i know that she generally said that this is the recommendation she s prepared to make i mean the decision she s prepared to make it s based on the recommendations she was receiving from the field and after intensive questioning of those involved again i do not know how precisely detailed it was beyond that q what is the president s understanding why yesterday one of the people who went into the compound a couple weeks ago came out over the weekend with some speculation that he may have told law enforcement people something that precipitated this action why yesterday mr stephanopoulos this is the first i ve heard i think what we can go to is what the fbi and the attorney general has said there were indications that those inside the compound were at some danger it was clear that the negotiations had broken down and it was the judgment of the experts involved in the negotiations that the situation was not going to get any better at all there was also some concern over the vulnerability of the agents themselves who had been working long beyond the time that these teams normally have to work and as the attorney general has said there was some concern over the fact that they did not have replacements in place who could stand in for them and there was a concern over the safety all of these factors came into play they also considered the advice of a number of psychologists and other experts on david koresh and those in the compound i would just go back to what the attorney general has said you have to make the best judgment you can given the information you have at the time they did obviously we all regret the loss of life it s a terribly unfortunate situation we all wish it could have turned out differently but that doesn t take away from the judgments that were made at the time q george when did the president know that they were going to use tear gas was it before the assault on the compound mr stephanopoulos i just don t know i don t believe he was given a lot of detail on exactly how the operation would go i just don t know q along that point george can you say whether the plan was presented to the president by the attorney general as a way to end the standoff one way or the other yesterday mr stephanopoulos i think it was presented as a way to increase the pressure on those in the compound and we all hoped as a way to move some of those out and bring it in it wasn t presented as tomorrow is d day this is it q is the president satisfied that a he had all this relevant information necessary to make a decision and b that janet reno had all the relevant information necessary to make a decision mr stephanopoulos oh i think he s satisfied that they were acting on the best advice and the best information they had and he s not second guessing it in any way whatsoever q george was there a hour gap between conversations between the president and the attorney general in other words they spoke at a m and they didn t speak again until clinton got back from dinner at mr stephanopoulos i think that s likely yes q did he call her what time did she call was there a gap between when she called him i mean was he at dinner when she called and mr stephanopoulos no no no i think he called her last night i couldn t swear to it but i believe he called her last night he just wanted to talk to her q what was going on mr stephanopoulos not that i know of no q what do you know about the situation now everyone has perished who except eight or nine and do you know any of the other details mr stephanopoulos i don t know any more details than the fbi reported in waco q watching cnn or how was he keeping track of what is going on if he wasn t talking to his attorney general how was he keeping track of what was going on here i mean with all due respect to cnn is that how he was doing it mr stephanopoulos no there was also as i said several people in the white house were in constant contact with their counterparts at justice to have the full and complete information q who were those contacts i mean was it mack mclarty webb hubbell how was the president being kept informed that s not a mr stephanopoulos i believe mack was in contact with webb i spoke with several people at the justice department i believe bruce lindsey spoke with people at the justice department either bernie or vince was also in contact at different times during the day with people at the justice department we were fully briefed and fully informed q we were told this morning that the president may have spoken a chance that he may have spoken with webb do you know if that s true or not mr stephanopoulos i think there s a chance he may have i don t believe he did but i think there s certainly a chance that he may have at some point i don t believe he did i think that the last contact he had during the day yesterday directly with the justice department was the a m phone call with the attorney general but the white house was fully informed on a minute to minute basis of what was happening in waco and what was happening at the justice department q george who decided that the briefing would be done by the attorney general mr stephanopoulos the attorney general q did you or did the white house communications staff were you ever involved with that decision mr stephanopoulos no we were told about it q did you ask her to go on nightline and macneil lehrer and all that stuff was that part of mr stephanopoulos no q there was no advice from the white house at all about her she was on all night all day laughter mr stephanopoulos yes and she did a very good job q why did you decide to have the president s reaction to the situation be only a written statement which is traditionally the white house s way of distancing the president from the issue not having him appear as personally saying anything mr stephanopoulos well that wasn t the intent at all as i said we had to we wanted to wait until we had all of the information at hand the president is also making a statement today the president made a statement yesterday morning the president has been fully involved q after this turned into less than a successful operation the only statement from the president was what was on paper after the attorney general had already given what amounted to the major facts in this mr stephanopoulos well it was the first statement from the president not the only statement from the president number one q after the mr stephanopoulos number two well the first number two the attorney general q he gave a statement early in the morning when the thing was starting to move mr stephanopoulos right and he gave one yesterday and he s giving one today now the second point q it just happens this was a written statement with no sort of communications policy or thought process involved it was the president wants to put out a written statement mr stephanopoulos knowing what we knew at the time we thought it was appropriate for the president and he thought it was appropriate to put out a written statement expressing his regret and expressing his support for the attorney general s q why was it not appropriate for him to personally do something mr stephanopoulos well he did personally do so that is his statement it s a statement under his name q george yesterday during the briefing you didn t say the president took full responsibility for what happened mr stephanopoulos i certainly did q no what you said was mr stephanopoulos that s just not right susan q well i think you can go back to the transcript i mean unless i miss something mr stephanopoulos i d love to q janet reno said that she took full responsibility and you said that she made the decision that the fbi mr stephanopoulos and the president takes responsibility absolutely q took responsibility all right mr stephanopoulos check the transcript q considering how little was known about what was going on inside the compound and even now how little is known why is washington calling this a mass suicide mr stephanopoulos well i think that knowing what we know now and given all of the actions of david koresh before and during it is painfully clear that those there were under his control q it s stretching it a little bit where the kids are concerned though isn t it george mr stephanopoulos i think that that is an entirely different matter i mean i think that david koresh must bear responsibility for the deaths of those children absolutely but he clearly was intent on creating some kind of an apocalyptic incident and that s what he did q you re still operating completely on assumption right i mean you have no evidence or you know of no evidence that this was mass suicide mr stephanopoulos we have evidence that those inside the compound set fire to the compound which led to the deaths of those inside q i didn t quite hear it this might be ann s question i didn t quite hear it but at what time did clinton himself put out a statement on this i know dee dee said some stuff on this at p m but the president put out mr stephanopoulos at p m p m q right after the evening news went on the air mr stephanopoulos no right when we had all the information we were working on it q dee dee confirmed this morning that the investigation the president is going to announce is going to be an administration run investigation why not have someone from the outside to make sure that it s not colored by those who would have a political stake particularly those at the atf whose actions have already been mr stephanopoulos i think that clearly the atf and the justice department will bear responsibility for the investigation that s not to rule out as is often in investigations like this having some sort of independent involvement as well but it will be run by the treasury and justice q are you confident that you will not have any problem getting mr stephanopoulos absolutely q george did the president reach out to anybody else to get advice after the meeting with janet reno and who else in the white house sat in on that meeting anyone else from justice mr stephanopoulos i don t believe anybody else was there at the time it was a phone call on monday it wasn t a meeting q sunday mr stephanopoulos sunday it was a phone call it wasn t a meeting i believe he might have been there with bruce but beyond that i think he just talked to the attorney general q george you said that in that phone call she said that we want to go in and take action as you said that will force him out what did he think she was talking about if he didn t know about tear gas what exactly was his idea of what he was approving mr stephanopoulos i think he was approving an action to increase the pressure on q q it didn t matter how she did that mr stephanopoulos no no i mean q what information did he have in terms of how this would proceed presumably he would have wanted to know not minute by minute but in a general sense mr stephanopoulos i think he knew that this was the recommendation of those on the ground and the recommendation of the law enforcement agencies i just don t know q what is this when you say that this was the recommendation mr stephanopoulos the action to increase pressure i don t know exactly what he was told whether he was going to be told that the tank was going to go up to the left wall and punch a hole in the window or whether he was just told generally that they were moving forward in a way that would increase the pressure i just don t know q it s hard to imagine him not asking though q that janet reno presented him with as her best advice about what they should go forward with he would have agreed mr stephanopoulos he was he did ask some general questions about the advice and recommendation he gave at the same time and i would repeat that this was based on the unanimous recommendation of the law enforcement agencies involved q george it would seem that this question about just exactly in what detail the president was informed about the nature of the operation is going to come up again here and elsewhere can you take that question and mr stephanopoulos absolutely yes q get the answer and come back to us with all of it mr stephanopoulos yes q can you tell us that there was never a meeting a strategy session where you and others decided we will put out a written statement from the president and we will have janet reno be on all of these television broadcasts mr stephanopoulos never never q and you never called the justice department and said to anyone or janet reno you re the one who needs to be out front explaining this mr stephanopoulos not once q it just happened that way that she was the spokesman that no one ever saw bill sessions until mr stephanopoulos she made a decision as attorney general that it was important for her as the operational officer in charge as the person who made the decision to go out and take the questions on this tragic incident q she had no guidance from the white house at all mr stephanopoulos we certainly didn t object q but did you laughter no i m sure you didn t object but did you suggest it was this a plan mr stephanopoulos no absolutely not q a strategy mr stephanopoulos no q did she clear it mr stephanopoulos no q did she notify you mr stephanopoulos we certainly knew about it q what happened to this great detailed process you have for clearing and talking to every public information officer and every under every rock and every place in government that something as major as this could have occurred without a discussion between you and the public information people at least at the justice department mr stephanopoulos the attorney general made the decision and the attorney general wanted to go forward it seemed like a good decision it was a good decision she did a good job q let me ask it this way george if in hindsight how you would handle it mr stephanopoulos i think it was handled very well q you wouldn t change a thing if mr stephanopoulos change what q the way the white house handled any part of it from start to finish mr stephanopoulos well i think that s an awful broad question and we re certainly going to have a review one of the reasons for the investigation is to look for ways in the future that something like this see what we can learn from an incident like this and see what we can learn about how to handle them if you re talking specifically about the issue of the press conferences no there wouldn t make any change at all q two questions first of all on her going on tv no white house people or outside media consultants came up with this idea it s just very reminiscent of what you guys did during the campaign mr stephanopoulos how so q i m thinking of like watching clinton on nightline after the draft story watching clinton on mr stephanopoulos there s absolutely no comparison yesterday there was a law enforcement incident the incident ended in tragic deaths of many many people the attorney general was involved in that decision the attorney general made the decision to do that she felt it was her responsibility in the interest of public information to go out and take the questions of the press in order to make sure that all of the questions were answered and she did a fantastic job q the second question is did as someone who knows clinton as well as you do can you understand why it s sort of hard to believe that he might not have asked some detailed questions about what she intended to do in other words she came and she said i m going to put pressure on them it s hard not to see clinton who s fairly intelligent and inquisitive asking how q what kind mr stephanopoulos both the attorney general said that he did ask questions he did ask general questions i don t have a minute by minute account of the conversation q how long a conversation mr stephanopoulos i think it was about minutes q telephone conversation mr stephanopoulos yes q george was the federal cost of this standoff ever a consideration in terms of stepping up the pressure mr stephanopoulos i don t believe so no q george you keep saying that the president takes full responsibility but then you refer to it as her decision does the president not accept the fact that as commander in chief it is ultimately his decision mr stephanopoulos i don t know what this has to do with commander in chief this was a law enforcement action not a military action and he clearly takes responsibility for the decisions of the law enforcement agencies involved taken in his government i mean i think there s just no ambiguity about that q but is he accepting it as his decision as well as hers or is he saying it s her decision there s a difference mr stephanopoulos as a matter of fact it was her decision he did not object to that decision he clearly takes full responsibility q george this briefing has gone on just a little over minutes and as you can see a lot of things can be exchanged what exactly did they spend minutes talking about if it was just very general that s a long period of time in a phone conversation mr stephanopoulos it is an awful long phone conversation it was a very important phone conversation i think brit has asked that we take the question and i ve said that i would q one of the things reno said last night is that the buck stops here i think that was her direct quotation does the president agree with that in this case mr stephanopoulos the president says he accepts full responsibility i think what the attorney general was saying is that she made a decision that she s going to accept all the responsibility that comes to her and she s not shrinking from that at all but neither is the president q at any point in the conversation last night between the president and the attorney general or this morning did she ever offer her a resignation mr stephanopoulos not to my knowledge q even before the fire was out yesterday there were some republicans on capitol hill calling for an investigation is the white house at all concerned about the timing of those requests trying to make political hay out of this situation mr stephanopoulos no and i don t want to cast any questions about the motives of those who are requesting investigation we want an investigation and we ll have a full and complete investigation q in what forum will you answer brit s question will you put out a written statement will you the wires how will you answer the question that you ve taken mr stephanopoulos i m just not sure q george can you remind us what the president was doing all yesterday afternoon where he was and what meetings he was involved in mr stephanopoulos i ll have to try and remember he had a series of meetings with different members of the staff during the afternoon he was certainly monitoring the situation in waco and getting periodic reports on that as well he did see some on cnn as well i believe he saw a fair amount of the fbi press briefing as well q and those reports would have come to him from mack mclarty would they do you think mr stephanopoulos mack talked to him bruce talked to him i talked to him q george to follow helen s question in their conversation this morning did they discuss at all her statement last night in response to the question about whether she would resign did he say i don t know why you felt the need to say that i m here to reassure you that you don t have to do this did that come up at all mr stephanopoulos i don t know if it even came up that specifically i know that the bulk of the conversation was discussing where do we go from here and what form the investigation q the didn t talk at all about her kind of remarkable comment last night about mr stephanopoulos well i believe she was asked a question q and her response was if the president wants me to i will mr stephanopoulos which would be i think the standard response that most cabinet members would give i mean it s a conditional statement q have a need to talk about whether personally about whether the president wanted her mr stephanopoulos i don t know if they talked about it i mean what i learned about the conversation was that it was largely about the investigation itself and this just didn t come up i did not ask the question if they talked about q will you take that with the brit package mr stephanopoulos certainly laughter q george for the record does the president want her to resign i know dee dee answered this morning mr stephanopoulos absolutely not he supports janet reno she s a good attorney general she s done a good job she handled a difficult situation extremely well q george does the president feel that he and janet reno were let down by the unanimous professional advice from the law enforcement experts on the ground mr stephanopoulos no and the president is not second guessing that decision and those recommendations in any way that is not to say that he doesn t regret the loss of life everybody regrets the loss of life in this situation but the best judgments were made in a difficult situation based on the best information we had q george the minute conversation was the one on sunday is that correct mr stephanopoulos yes q how long was the one at a m yesterday morning mr stephanopoulos i don t know i ll take that question too q were these outside experts that they were consulting with or experts within the atf and the fbi mr stephanopoulos you d have to ask them i m just not sure i know that there were several experts q and also why weren t there replacements for these people is the unit that small mr stephanopoulos again i think it is a very small highly specialized unit but i think it s one of the kinds of things that the investigation will examine q george isn t there a factor here involving the fbi director normally a president when he wants to get information doesn t only asks the attorney general i know the chain of command but presidents talk to their fbi directors in this case throughout this entire siege he has not felt that he could pick up the phone and talk to bill sessions who is from waco and get expertise from him on what to do and what not to do mr stephanopoulos i think he talked to the fbi director well in the beginning of the situation when it first broke out in waco at the same time the attorney general bears the ultimate responsibility and he was getting fully briefed from the attorney general q don t you think the ambiguous situation that director sessions is in has some impact on the way the president is briefed and on the way that all of this evolved mr stephanopoulos not at all i mean it s perfectly appropriate that he be briefed by the attorney general and that the attorney general has supervisory authority over the fbi director and that s following the chain of command the press thank you end p m edt

has indicated that he will welcome congressional efforts to help this review proceed as quickly as possible this review will weigh all considerations that pertain to revision of such provisions and the initiation of the review may help to remedy some of the circumstances that have justified such provisions in the past for example because the russians are eager to have their status changed under the jackson vanik legislation president yeltsin personally assured president clinton in vancouver that he would look into individual cases involving continuing restrictions on emigration from russia

satan here is someones biblical claim for the characteristics of satan this is probably the portion of scripture that you were talking about isaiah this does speak of the morning star which according to you is the babylonian prince ok so i turn your attention to daniel this passage concerns a revelation of prophecy to daniel by the messenger from god within this passage the messenger from god speaks of how he fought for weeks against the prince of the persian kingdom obviously this prince was not an earthly prince this prince of the persian kingdom is probably one of the demons in satan s hierarchy as such the morning star can be the prince of babylon w ho can also be satan another passage concerning satan s fall from heaven is ezekiel and separately devil chose to try to become greater than god he wanted to sit on god s throne when the devil was created he was one of the most beautiful angels in heaven we have here three distinct claims concerning the results of the devil s decision making a specific desire and a physical description now in support aside from the minor detail that an author seldom writes an unbiased account of the opposition we see isaiah isa how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nations isa for thou hast said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north isa i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high isa yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit doesn t say sits on god s throne says will exhault throne above the stars daniel dan then said he unto me fear not daniel for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyself before thy god thy words were heard and i am come for thy words dan but the prince of the kingdom of persia withstood me one and twenty days but lo michael one of the chief princes came to help me and i remained there with the kings of persia dan now i am come to make thee understand what shall be fall thy people in the latter days for yet the vision is for many days see who is being discussed ezekiel eze son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tyrus and say unto him thus saith the lord god thou sealest up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in beauty eze thou hast been in eden the garden of god every pre cious stone was thy covering the sardius topaz and the dia mond the beryl the onyx and the jasper the sapphire the em erald and the carbuncle and gold the workmanship of thy ta brets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created eze thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and i have set thee so thou wast upon the holy mountain of god thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire eze thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created till iniquity was found in thee eze by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence and thou hast sinned therefore i will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of god and i will destroy thee o covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire eze thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness i will cast thee to the ground i will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee eze thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffick therefore will i bring forth a fire from the midst of thee it shall devour thee and i will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee eze all they that know thee among the people shall be as tonished at thee thou shalt be a terror and never shalt thou be any more anyone else to make a claim about the characteristics of the devil

re christian meta ethics i wrote and who is to say that this interpretation is twisted there are many passages in the bible that in their most straightforward reading show the christian god behaving in just this way in article r c c cass ma bull com ddavis cass ma bull com dave davis writes this requires the assumption that all interpretations are equally valid that there is no way of reasonably distinguishing among them i wouldn t make that assumption i don t think it is a reasonable assumption no it follows from the fact that most christians choice of interpretation stems from a mix of beliefs that are influenced by the secular ethics of their culture and that are not fully determined by scripture whether or not there is some right interpretation matters not few christians claim the ability to read the mind of their god dave davis should note that it was michael who first stated the importance of secular and cultural influence in this thread i think michael is right in this but regardless it should be noted that this has not been a point of contention between michael and myself i have argued beyond michael s claims that the christian scriptures are open to so many interpretations including a wide divergence within the christian tradition that even their most important themes are vague again it does not matter that there is some right interpretation unless there is a way to determine what that right interpretation is it is the lack of an objective measure not the presumed lack of an answer that puts the force behind the line i argue michael and i and others read the bible with christian glasses among the things that this should imply is that the nt informs the ot even to the point of dominanting it some points in the ot ceremonial dietary laws are explicitly abrogated by the nt texts there are enough christian glasses varying over a sufficiently broad range of color that i can find a few that support my example no michael the conservative christians also take the gospel seriously what differentiates you is the way you interpret the gospel russell turpin s no here is misplaced not to say inappropriate michael s self description must govern the equation of radical liberal which seems implied by russell turpin is wrong in my opinion what makes michael radical is that he fully acknowledges that christian scripture and tradition fail to determine the doctrines that so many branches within christianity hold dear he is willing to live and practice his religion within this indeterminacy and he is willing to acknowledge that much of his understanding of things christian is influenced by ideas that are not purely christian those christians i have called conservative must also interpret but they do not recognize or at least are unwilling to admit the extent and importance of this russell turpin in an earlier post had said that michael michael s theological positions actually didn t tell him much about christianity dean simeon responds this time gently what do you mean more direct perhaps would have been what could you possibly mean the implied rhetorical effort to separate michael from the tradition is a failure michael is in the tradition if your idea of the tradition doesn t include him change your idea of the tradition i recognize that michael is part of the tradition but what does it tell one about a tradition covering origen aquinas jerry fallwell and jesse jackson that it also includes michael siemon not very much in short it is the extra christian principles that make michael s christianity beneficial and i suspect they would be as beneficial perhaps moreso without being filtered by christian interpretation this conclusion does not follow even in short from the argument that goes before a surprising logical ellipsis i think the conclusion does follow the purely christian principles that michael has are the ones he shares with others in the christian tradition or that can be derived from christian scripture these necessarily vague are not enough to drive his political stances that one should love one s neighbor is a purely christian principle that this means showing tolerance for homosexuality is not as to these political stances they are often at odds with what is commonly held in most of current christendom and so i suspect they could be better pressed outside it on the other hand i can well understand the counterpoint that these political stances become most influential when presented to those who need them most this is a theological statement worthy of barth dr turpin dd may wear the black robe of geneva yet having barely survived the effort to finish in computer science i doubt i will attempt a more difficult field any time soon russell

re is it good that jesus died brian ceccarelli wrote that s me kent i am not accusing you of evil things jesus is accusing you and it is not only you that he is accusing he is accusing everyone me you and everyone in the world is guilty whether one sees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with whether we do evil things we do them regardless kent sandvik responds hmm it seems that this is the core of christianity then you have to feel guilty i think i see where you are coming from kent jesus doesn t view guilt like our modern venacular colors it feelings have nothing to do with guilt feelings arise from the state of being guilty feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive feelings are a reaction from guilt jesus is talking about the guilt state not the reaction let me give you an example have you ever made a mistake have you ever lied to someone even a little white lie have you ever claimed to know something that you really didn t know have you ever hated someone have you ever been selfish are you guilty of any one of these the answer is of course yes you are guilty period that is it what jesus is getting at no big surprise feelings do not even enter the picture consider jesus s use of the word guilt as how a court uses it jesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of being imperfect the bible calls it the state that we are all sinners we all do bad things even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our guilt that we are all sinners it is it in our nature to do bad things we are sinners therefore we do bad things being a sinner is fact it is not a pleasant fact but it is just a fact we are not perfect calling us sinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you a human being guilty as charged and then there s this single personality that will save you from this universal guilt feeling you can handle your guilt in one of two ways acknowledge you made a mistake learn from it and try to not do it again in the meantime not punishing yourself for it which is the way jesus wants you to handle or it this is the healthy way or two the destructive way put yourself down slap yourself and feel like crap never forgive yourself force yourself to say a thousand hail marys even to suicide this the way jesus does not want us to deal with it all people fall into this category to some extent in their lives jesus is not in the business of saving us from this guilt feeling jesus is in the business of showing us how much he loves us despite our guilt jesus knows we are guilty that isn t new to him it is no big deal to him he just wants you to realize that this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him that is what he wants you to know why because he wants to have your company you are immensely valuable to him jesus wants a relationship with you however in our present sinful nature we are incapable of having this relationship god is perfect we are not you cannot fit a square peg into a round hole however god has provided a way for us to change our nature so that we can have a relationship with him god has provided jesus so that whosoever just believes in jesus will have their nature changed the holy spirit will move it and now divine nature is now within lives our very being and us and god communicate with each through his unifying holy spirit the benefits of this are endless for with the divine nature living within us we can now see our imperfections better we can now head them off at the pass with the power of the holy spirit living in us we now have his power to help us overcome our shortcomings because the divine nature lives within us we can now understand profound bible passages that never before we could understand because the divine nature now lives within us we now have authority over demonic forces and lastly because the divine nature now lives within us we have eternal life for the holy spirit is eternal the relationship with jesus is of the utmost importance because it is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to heavenly kingdom it is your relationship to the living god remember what jesus said at the tail end of matthew when he separated the goats from the sheep many people in the last day will ask him didn t i prophesy in your name and do miracles and do good things in your name and what did jesus say depart from me for i never knew you that is the cornerstone of christianity kent jesus must know you as his friend it is your relationship to jesus if he is your friend and you are his you will be counted among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven brian i will tell you a secret i don t feel guilty at all i do mistakes and i regret them however i ve never had this huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder good it shows that you have a strong self image that you love yourself that is the second greatest commandment jesus taught if only more people could do as you do as i said before in the common english venacular feeling guilty has a different meaning than the state of guilt this all is a very clear indication that you need a certain personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain religious doctrines and if your personality type is opposite then you are not that easily attached to a certain world view system i believe what we all need in our personalities is a lot less ego a lot less self centeredness and a lot more unconditional love there are humans that subscribe to the same notion the nice thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden the shoulders feel far more relaxed yes you have stated what jesus said remember come to me take my yoke upon your shoulders for my burden is light a yoke is used to direct oxen to do work once you have a relationship with jesus you and him share the yoke and the burdens of life having god at your side is of great advantage

objectivity was after years this discussion on objective seems to be falling into solipsism eg the recent challenge from frank dwyer for someone to prove that he can actually observe phenomena someones even made the statement that science is subjective and that even atom are subjective this is getting a bit silly and the word objective is losing all meaning lets start by remembering the definition of objective which has been already presented objective adj of or having to do with a material object as distinguished from a mental concept having actual existence a unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice b based on observable phenomenon the objectivity of a thing is not based on whether everyone agrees on that thing eg the world is objectively round regardless of the fact that there exist flat earthers but rather whether it is based observable and verifiable phenomenon instead of being based solely on peoples wishes feeling mental processes etc thus atoms being based on very observable and repeatable phenomenon are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective even weird high energy physics is based on observable phenomenon even though that observation can change the outcome nor are those observable phenomenon affected by emotion or personal prejudice eg chemical reactions do not change to the whims of different people thus to say that science is not objective ie objectively verifiable is a bit silly as that is the point of science now i will agree that science is not objectively good i will not thereby conclude though that science is not objective now some examples things which are objective a d tractor is larger than the average breadbox chlorophyll is green seawater contains salt there exists ozone in the atmosphere at least presently ozone blocks ultraviolet light ultraviolet light increases the incidents of skin cancer good on the other hand is a value judgement it doesn t seem to have an existence apart from what we give it unless someone can objectively show the existence of an omnipotent entity which has defined good we cannot quantify it touch it or collect it in any concrete sense eg i have a bag full of good now we do sometimes attempt to give the word good an objective meaning e g good has been used to denote strength resiliency speed etc that though is a subjective definition as some might not see strength and etc as necessarily good eg strength inspired by naziism is not generally viewed as good as to a morality i cannot say that i have ever seen a morality strictly based on verifiable observable phenomenon the closest i have seen is some form of the golden rule which concludes that it is best not to deliberately piss people off as they will likely then involve themselves in your life in a manner you won t like this is verifiable when you get in someone s face they will often retaliate another objective fact about morality is that a more powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group and thus can at times ignore that form of the golden rule without fear of reprisal now as to whether this enforcing of morality is good or bad is quite subjective by the way remember that subjective does not mean that a thing cannot be formally stated or even commonly agreed upon it only means that that it is not verifiable from observable phenomena or has a physical existence unto itself also note that i have not stated that there is no such thing as an objective morality or that i could not accept any such a morality i have simply stated that i have seen no evidence of any such morality one other thing to notice objective is many times used as synonymous with true and or absolute and subjective sometimes has the connotation of false and or relative tain t necessarily so for instance when a conclusion is based on objective but insufficient evidence then it can be both objective and false as to absolute it is easy to note that while we can objectively show that tnt is explosive but that does not absolutely mean that all tnt will explode and thus objective is not necessarily absolute either on the other hand something subjective can also be either absolutist or true for instance there are some theists who are specifically absolutist in their morality even though they have only subjective evidence to back it up further many a scientist and detective has been motivated by subjective reasons eg a gut feeling or hunch to investigate a phenomena or situation and gather the objective evidence necessary to support a true hypothesis on the whole though i would have to agree that objective evidence is much more trustworthy than subjective evidence later dave butler in starting any thesis it seems to me one should put forward as one s point of departure something incontrovertible the expression should be simple and dignified diogenes

history texts was ancient references to christianity in article c ztju fkx news cso uiuc edu cobb alexia lis uiuc edu mike cobb writes why is the nt tossed out as info on jesus i realize it is normally tossed out because it contains miracles but what are the other reasons far from being tossed out the gospels are taken almost universally as the primary source of information about jesus i am curious as to whom mike cobb is referring who tosses out the new testament undoubtedly a few naive atheists do this but the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that cobb ascribes this more broadly perhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is why except for some naive believers who unfortunately far outnumber nonbelievers both naive and critical are the gospels not taken as gospel truth that faithfully records just what happened two thousand years ago this has an easy answer and the answer has nothing to do with miracles no text is taken this way by a critical reader there is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text measures it by some set of criteria and then either confirms the text as historically valid or tosses out the text i suspect this myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and secondary school where certain texts are vested with authority and from writers such as josh mcdowell who pretend to present historical arguments along these lines for their religious program in fact most texts used in primary and secondary school history classes ought to be tossed out even the better such texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed above and josh mcdowell would not know a historical argument if it bit him on the keister twice let me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts and their use in studying history first all texts are historically valid all texts or to put this another way i have never seen a notion of historical validity that makes any sense when applied to a text second no text should be read as telling the gospel truth about historical events in the way that many students are wont to read history texts in primary and secondary school no text this includes your favorite author s history of whatever every text is a historical fact every text was written by some person or some group of people for some purpose hence every text can serve as historical evidence the question is what can we learn from a text of what interesting things if any does the text provide evidence the diaries of the followers of the maharishi formerly of oregon are historical evidence the gospels are historical evidence the letters of the officers who participated in the vampire inquests in eastern europe are historical evidence the modern american history textbooks that whitewash great american figures are historical evidence these are all historical evidence of various things they are not much evidence at all that the maharishi formerly of oregon could levitate that jesus was resurrected that vampires exist or that great american figures are as squeaky clean as we learned in school they are better evidence that some people saw the maharishi late of oregon levitate that some of the early christians thought jesus was resurrected that many people in eastern europe saw vampires return from the grave and that we still have an educational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather than teach history how does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of historical evidence text or otherwise evinces this is a very complex question that has no easily summarized answer there are many books on the subject or various parts of the subject i enjoy david hackett fischer s historian s fallacies as a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy to read texts present history it s relatively cheap it s easy to read give it a try russell
ceci s rosicrucian adventure hello ceci my name is tony and i have a few comments on your rosicrucian adventure i hereby state that i am not claiming or denying membership in any order fraternity etc with or without the word rosicrucian in the name of the organization i only claim having done some homework this is intended as a friendly article and if at times it seems different it s my lack of writing skills showing nothing else heck english may be my second language and then again maybe not by now i proceed i had an ehum interesting experience with the rosicrucians or at least rosicrucians of some sort last sunday let s start with the name rosicrucian i took me a long time to come to the conclusion that there is a difference between a member of a rosicrucian body and being a rosicrucian so when you say that you met some rosicrucians you mean members of a group that calls themselves rosicrucian at least that is what your observation suggests i d prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the lectorium rosicrucianum only because they may be confused by some readers of this newsgroup with the rosicrucian order amorc based the usa jurisdiction in san jose ca this being the rc org with the most members last time i looked of course most members does not necessarily mean best anyway the lectorium rosicrucianum claims they descend at least in part from what was the gold und rosenkreuz golden and rosy cross from the th century there were two golden and rosy cross the first chronologically more alchemical the second with masonic tinges but their history is the subject of a complete chapter you ll have to trust me when i tell you that if that lecture class whatever had been presented by amorc it is unlikely that you would have had the same impression i e you d probably have had a positive impression more likely than a negative one imho the first guy also said that the r s are a mystical christian order and that they base their teachings on the teachings of the kathars english from the thirteenth century again instead of r s it should be lectorium rosicrucianum it is curious to know that other rc orders in the usa claim to be non sectarian the cathars were a heretic christian sect that directly challenged the authority of the medieval catholic church they flourished during the th century century which saw the religious zeal expressed in the crusades and also the growing disillusion with the catholic church and the worldly ways of its clerics it was largely in response to the church s unseemly pomp and splendor that catharism took root first in northern italy then throughout the south of france what made me a bit suspicious was the way they first said that we all contained something divine and could find our way back to divinity then that we couldn t become divine as the persons we are currently but if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss i don t see nothing fundamentally wrong with us containing something divine and yes i don t like phrases like eternal bliss either how to robotize people and brainwash for a moment i thought you were referring to madison ave madison avenue in new york city is where the most influential read commercial advertising is produced here in the usa peace tony btw i have read the intro letters of the lrc which they will mail you free of charge
re burden of proof in article apr batman bmd trw com jbrown batman bmd trw com writes the default condition in the absence of a preponderance of evidence either way is that the proposition or assertion is undecidable and the person who takes the undecidable position and says that he she simply disbelieves that the proposition is true is the only one who holds no burden of proof this is why the so called weak atheist position is virtually unassailable not because it stands on a firm foundation of logical argument but because it s proponents simply disbelieve in the existence of god s and therefore they hold no burden of proof when you don t assert anything you don t have to prove anything that s where weak atheism draws its strength but its strength is also its achilles heel without assertions axioms one has no foundation upon which to build as a philosophy it s virtually worthless imo of course yes as a philosophy weak atheism is worthless this is true in exactly the same sense that as a philosophy christians disbelief in zeus is worthless atheists construct their personal philosophies from many different sources building non god based ideas in the same way as christians build non zeus based ideas of thunderbolts atheists no more base their philosophy on atheism than christians base theirs on the nonexistence of zeus the weak atheist position is logically extremely assailable any logical demonstration of the existence of a god completely destroys it as soon as the demonstration is made in the presence of a given weak atheist atheists in this newsgroup are barraged regularly with attempts to provide such a logical demonstration and they all fail miserably in fact most of the people around here who claim the strong as opposed to mathematical atheist position do so on this basis not only do we not believe in a god but also all the arguments presented in favor of particular gods have to date proven unsound therefore one can say that those gods as argued by those arguments do not exist this doesn t apply to such philosophers gods as are defined to be logically undemonstrable but these are not the gods of popular religion and the coherence of such claims is quite questionable jim perry perry dsinc com decision support inc matthews nc these are my opinions for a nominal fee they can be yours

hail stan i found this on the net at my college it sounds pretty good to me what do you folks think this are the tenets of stan as handed down and set within the holy book of stan thou shalt not spill thine drinks or waste thine food for all that is is sacred and to waste is the denizen of luc the infidel all who waste today shall have not tomorrow thou shalt pay heed to those who know the higher calling of stan so that they may teach you the way and that thou shalt become one with stan and the universe shall be in your hands thou shalt honor thy loved ones and cherish those near you for they are the true path to happiness and happiness is a devine gift of thy lord stan stan is the one true god and shall be taken before all others so that the false gods will know that he is the one and all who oppose him shall forever be banished to the form of the sheep and be sent to the flocks of luc for all eternity the word is the law and the law is the word the word is within thine own heart follow the path and be true to thine own self and thou shalt be blessed by stan thy lord and saviour thou shalt honor the faiths of others for it is their choice to follow this path and do not think less of others for being of a different faith yet even in the face of these false gods do not waiver in thine faith in stan and hope that the unbeliever will see the light that is stan thou shalt not wrong others for being different for stan cherishes the different and holds freedom in the highest regard for to do less would be to fall in with luc the infidel for stan does not control he merely guides and lets the choice lie within thine own heart thou shalt know that thy lord stan has many names and is called differently by many people but know also that stan is the true name and all those of the faith shall know that stan is god and god is stan thou shalt be to the world what thou art to thineself for to be false to others is to be false to yourself thy lord stan asks not that you be like him he asks only that you be like yourself for that is all you were ever meant to be thou shalt not kill the innocent nor spill blood unnecessarily for those who are deserving of death shall be dealt with by stan and sent for all eternity to the flocks of luc and those who harm the children of stan being born of woman shall be judged as the sheep of luc and spend all of time within his flocks these commandments are the words of stan heed them and he shall be happy and if thy lord stan is happy his happiness shall be passed down to his followers hail stan it seems like a pretty good set of tenets to me v i like kittens e mail robert voss die especially with rgv ultb isc rit edu andrews memorial dr die a side order of rgv ritvax isc rit edu cpu die french fries rgv ritvax bitnet rochester ny die die i am darkness eternal call me my phone number is die

re is it good that jesus died jasons atlastele com jason smith writes bskendig netcom com brian kendig writes and i felt torn when i began to disagree with a lot of what the bible and my priests told me did it start getting a little uncomfortable did your style start feeling a bit cramped yes that s exactly what i felt my heart just felt that what i was being taught was wrong a basically good message but framed in errors i could not with a clear conscience accept that women were somehow not equal to men that homosexuals are guilty of their lifestyle that pride in one s work is a bad thing that jesus died for me i don t want anybody to die for me especially as an impersonal act where the person can t possibly even know me well enough to really know if i m worth dying for or not i was never able to accept the bit about jesus s death being a good thing if that means that i m just not comprehending a basic message of christianity then so be it maybe i m just not compatible with christianity i just refuse to follow rules blindly and since i can t even convince myself that your god even exists in the way you describe it i ve got to just follow my own conscience in these matters i know how that goes knowing i couldn t and didn t want to live up to those impossibleand rather incovenient rules are what kept me outside too don t think that my morals are shoddy or nonexistent just because i don t believe in your god i will not steal and i will not murder not because i fear divine repudiation but because these just aren t in my character you may think there s nothing keeping me from just running around on a murdering spree stealing things when i m able insulting people for the heck of it because i m not answerable to anyone but you d be wrong i m answerable to myself a life like that would be a cheap life i happen to want to earn respect in myself till i met the man that is my initial break with christianity came after a lot of soul searching and a lot of wondering why i could no longer feel the presence of god with me i finally decided that i had once felt this presence just as i had felt my mighty teddy bear beside me when i was a little tyke protecting me from the monsters under the bed that i had believed in god just as i had believed in the teddy bear as something of an emotional crutch to protect me from perceived dangers since then i ve never abandoned the possibility that maybe your supernatural trinity does exist but there are a few times when in my darkened room by my bed i have set aside everything i believe for a moment and called out to whatever s out there because i want to know the truth even if it means abandoning everything i know and i have not yet received an answer only when i truly listened to myself body and soul did i realize that i could no longer honestly keep up the charade of being christian there is a higher truth in the universe and christianity just ain t it any suggestions on what or who or where it might be and why nope it may well be unknowable scientists have suggested that the universe may be finite and wrap around on itself the three dimensional universe may be mapped onto a four dimensional supersphere in the same way you can map a two dimensional plane onto a three dimensional sphere see sphereland the sequel to flatland for more thoughts on this our entire universe might just be an electron in a four dimensional universe which in turn may only be an insignificant speck in a universe above that and so on and so forth until the variables become too much for us to even speculate on that is there s no possible way for us to know exactly how we came to be so there s no reason at all to believe that your god exists nor had anything to do with it ok you may say so now if i m just being good am i doing good enough that s for you to answer if you feel you re doing fine then go ahead and ignore us foolish little christians we can present what we ve seen and experienced providing our witness but it isn t up to us to make that seed sprout christians have provided me with nothing except quotes from your holy book and all sorts of tactics to try to get me to believe guilt trips insinuations that i m without morals arguments from disbelief how can you possibly believe that god doesn t exist and so forth all i m asking is for you to convince me i want to be convinced but it s not going to be easy so much as you don t like what we re selling there just may be someone out there that can identify with it methinks you could give us all a lesson in tolerance and back off having had years upon years of contact with your religion from both the inside and the outside i view it as harmful in many ways it preys on people who want to find meaning in their lives and once it s got these people it teaches them to have pity and sometimes starkly intolerant of others who do not share these views maybe you ll say that your religion doesn t teach that but i ve got to judge christianity from the christians i know i feel that it is entirely possible and good to have faith in one s self and to be a positive influence on society for no better reason than that so i hope that my words in this newsgroup will at least make some people think i want christians to realize that there are perfectly valid lifestyles and opinions that have nothing to do with their deity whatsoever and i want people who are considering christianity to realize that christianity does not hold the sole key to a happy fulfilled life i have known some very nice christians who have done some very nice things i think what sets these people apart from the general masses is that they recognize that their religious beliefs may be wrong and they know the weaknesses of their religion yet they still decide to believe but they keep their beliefs to themselves and do not think any less of people who don t agree with them obviously the debate on the veracity and reliability of the source of the christian s faith is far from conclusive notwithstanding how vehemently we propose otherwise precisely my point you ve still not given me a reason to be a christian instead of a buddhist or a moslem the nice thing about religion if you lose yourself deeply enough in it is that eventually you ll be able to feel justified in most anything you want to do y know your right fortunately for everyone around me i m not religious i m a christian just as the moslems aren t religious and the buddhists aren t religious who is religious then brian kendig je ne suis fait comme aucun bskendig

commandments i the basics why should anyone check let s restrict this to christians why do we want to find commandments in the books regarded as scripture what s going on i will pass on psychologizing answers whether dismissive or more open as not the kind of issue to deal with here the question is what is the theological point involved and it has been quoted at me often enough by those who don t believe i take it seriously that jesus is said to have said if you love me you will obey my commands john i am like any christian the slave of christ and it is my will that i should do as he wills me to do i am also or instead his younger brother but still under his direction though we both call god abba christians therefore will try to find what it is that their lord commands them and discovering it will feel obligated to do it or to confess their failure readers here may set aside the theologizing jargon such as slaves of christ the point is that adherents of a religion will read the texts whether classified as inspired or not that are held up as models in an effort to find application to their own situations this practice ranges from devotional reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon ical scripture as the word of god and at the highest pitch this leads to a question of whether we can find in inspired scripture something that can act as absolute guidance for our actions the problem is in finding out just what it is our lord commands i am going to set aside for this essay one major direction in which christians have looked for these commands namely christian tradition that is not because i reject tradition but because my primary audience in this essay is protestants who deny tradition a determinative value in favor of the witness of scripture the question i want to deal with is what commandments can we find from our lord in scripture and that turns out to be a hard question if any of my protestant inquisitors would like to turn the discussion to the authority of tradition i can accomodate them unlike most protestants episcopalians admit claims from a scripture b reason and c tradition on roughly equal standing earlier in john than my quote above we read john i give you a new commandment love one another this is the only place in the nt where christians are given an explicit commandment with the context commenting on its imperative mode pronouncement by jesus at the same meal so we readers infer since it is not in john but in the synoptics jesus says take this bread this is my body mark cf matthew luke corinthians the mode is imperative greek labete and hence this too is a commandment in both cases we have to infer that the command is directed to a wider circle than the immediate collocation of disciples because we judge the evangelist s point in mentioning it with the disciples by then mostly or entirely dead is that we are expected to follow this as a commandment from our lord in the case of communion paul s mention at least this is probably true of the evangelists also implies an ongoing ritual liturgy in which these words operate to bind christians to the original command to his disciples as a continuing commandment to the christian community i am entirely comfortable with this inference but i must point out that it is there between us and the occasion on which jesus spoke the command i take it as a clear inference at the very least the evangelist s notion that all christians are called to love one another in jesus command directed at the disciples but i have to call attention to the inference the command cannot apply to me without the generalization from the specific context of its statement to my own context as a disciple of christ all reading of scripture has to make such inferences to get any sense out of the text whatsoever this is a general problem in reading these texts we cannot read them at all without our own understanding of our native languages in which we normally read the translated texts and without some appreciation of the original context and at points the original languages when english misleads us i am going to presume in what follows that we have the general problem of how to read scripture under control i don t really think this is true but it will suffice for my current purposes i will address only the issues that arise when we have already coped with the understanding of a year old text from another world than the one we live in questions at that level only introduce more reser vations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we can read the texts as the original audience might have done among the reasons we have for seeing john s agapate allelou as a general commandment not merely an instruction by jesus to this disciples on that one occasion and one linking it to the synoptic great commandment is that we have criticism from jesus about limiting our love to those whom we congenially associate with in matthew ff we read you have learnt how it was said you must love your neighbor and hate your enemy but i say to you love your enemies in fact the leviticus context quoted does not say hate your enemy it is merely the common human presumption and leviticus is at pains to say that the love should extend to strangers amongst the people of israel luke in expanding on this same q context goes on to have jesus say even sinners love those who love them all of this suggests quite strongly i d say that limiting the scope of the new commandment is not quite what jesus has in mind in short inference leads me to generalizing the actual text to a command that is in force on christians and with objects not limited to other christians trickier than the agapate allelou or institution of communion there is the case of the great commission where matthew mark the twelve are sent out to evangelize proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand the verb is imperative ke russete but the context is rather specific to the twelve and there are further specifiers as in do not turn your steps to pagan territory and do not enter any samaritan town the lukan parallels are even more specific to jesus final journey to jerusalem which make it harder to see this generalizing to all christians than the previous examples that hasn t prevented christians from making such an inference what i have to call attention to is that such inference is not justified in the text nor unlike the first two cases i cite by the rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader still paul seems to have felt obliged to proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand even contrary to jesus instructions to the to the gentiles to the ends of the earth so christians after him have also taken this as a commandment in the sense of john do i accept this i don t know it is surely rather speculative but you see how the ripples of inference spread out from the text that is the pretext christians may infer a general commandment applicable to all from what is presented in the gospels as a specific occasion i do not necessarily object to this kind of generalization but i insist that people who make it must have an understanding that they are reasoning at some considerable length from what we actually have in scripture there are assumptions involved in this reasoning and these are not themselves scriptural though people will do their best to justify their assumptions by other references to scripture which simply adds more inference into the mix let s move on to the great commandment that we should love god with our whole hearts and minds and souls this is perhaps the synoptic equivalent of john s agapate allelou and yet it is not presented as a commandment in our texts rather the context is controversy with the pharisees to cite matthew ff but when the pharisees heard that he had silenced the sadducees they got together and to disconcert him one of them put a question master which is the greatest commandment of the law it is by no means obvious here though i accept it as such that jesus answer is meant to be a commandment to christians he is answering a polemic from his enemies mark s account in casts the answer in a far more positive light as so the scribe in this version says far more important than any holocaust i need to point out that this word originates in the context of animal sacrifice forget the nazis for this or sacrifice luke is intermediate he has a lawyer posing the question to disconcert jesus and gets the good samarian parable for his pains luke the contexts here are so confusingly various that one could be forgiven for drawing no inferences in no account is this said as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on christians though i think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each case that jesus thinks it to be so the point is that our mental gears have to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about what we are commanded to do by jesus and all of this is contingent on our understanding the point of jesus use of the torah in the all quite different gospel accounts and the application of such a context to us the different contexts among the synoptics are curious it should be noted that only in luke do we get the fixing of this command by the parable of the good samaritan we may look for an analogous intent in matthew where gives the golden rule as the meaning of the law and the prophets and where we may also hear an echo of hillel saying the same a generation before jesus if we make these associations which i think are entirely reasonable we are again indulging in inference the texts do not explicitly support us rather we read the texts as having this kind of inter relationship current literary theory calls this intertextuality my discussion of why the agapate allelou has to apply beyond the community of the disciples and beyound the circle of christian believers applies again here to buttress a conclusion that this is despite the presentation not saying so explicitly a commandment to christians few christians would disagree with my conclusions but i must point out that they are conclusions they depend on rather elaborate chains of reasoning that are simply not present in the texts themselves the contextual problem keeps coming up more and more severely as we look at those sayings of jesus that are not so universally taken by christians as commandments and we get some really hard cases take divorce mark is pretty clear the man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty of adultery against her cf luke except that matthew has an escape clause except in the case of fornication this seems to be a rather clear commandment whether or not we take matthew s reservation and some christians to this day take it so but some don t at least in practice this is rather peculiar it is not as if jesus were not explicit about this whereas he says nothing at all about some of the things people gnash their teeth over how is it possible if the commands of christ are clear that matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists of the synoptic tradition i m going to continue this examination into ever murkier waters but this is enough to start with the theme is finding commandments in scripture is an exercise in inference our inferences are informed by our assumptions that is our own cultural biases i have so far identified a very few commandments that are generally accepted by all christians and yet in these already some of the difficulties start to surface it is these difficulties i want to discuss in my next essay on this topic the divorce commandment already strikes at some of the difficulties i see almost no evidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn me with spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc couples or misc legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce or demanding that us law refuse to allow it or refuse unrepentant divorcees places in their churches that is not to say that divorce doesn t enter into consideration in general it is most definitely a matter of concern in even the most liberal church circles for example a wildly liberal episcopalian priest of my aqauintence in a wildly liberal diocese has recommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a private secular ceremony before a judge so that the public ceremony he celebrated need not go through an agonizing examination by officials who would just as soon not take on this role of

re christians above the law was clarification of pe in article apr ualr edu nunnally acs harding edu john nunnally writes when are we going to hear a christian answer to this question in paraphrase on what or whose authority do christians proclaim that they are above the law and above the prophets major and minor and not accountable to the ten commandments of which jesus clearly spoke his opinion in matthew what is the source of this pseudo doctrine who is the pseudo teacher who is the great deceiver ok here s at least one christian s answer jesus was a jew not a christian in this context matthew makes sense matt do not think that i jesus came to abolish the law or the prophets i did not come to abolish but to fulfill jesus lived under the jewish law however he was the culmination of the promises of the prophets he came to fulfill the prophecies and fully obey god s purposes verse says for truly i say to you until heaven and earth pass away not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the law until all is accomplished the key to this verse imho is the last phrase jesus as the fulfillment of the law accomplished what the law was supposed to accomplish jesus did not say that he was the fulfillment of the law and unless i m mistaken heaven and earth have not yet passed away am i mistaken and even assuming that one can just gloss over that portion of the word of jesus do you really think that all is accomplished verse whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments and so teaches others shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever keeps and teaches them he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven taken in the context of jesus teaching jewish people about living lives under the law this makes sense then why didn t jesus say any jew who annuls in v are you saying that all of jesus recorded words mean nothing to gentiles are you really saying that jesus only spoke for and to the jews jesus didn t mention your name does that mean he wasn t speaking to you when you read the words of jesus do you think he is speaking to someone other than you in general it appears that jesus is responding to some criticism he must have received about doing away with the law that was not jesus intent at all you said above that jesus was the fulfillment of the law are you saying that does not mean doing away with the law he had come to earth to live the law as it should be lived and fulfill the promises made by god to his people all the way back to eve gen the serpent will bruise your heel but he will bruise his head gen jps i will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and hers they shall strike at your head and you shall strike at their heel gen nrsv i will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and hers he will strike your head and you will strike his heel gen kjv and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel looks like your translation has taken a few liberties with the word jesus appeared to be doing away with the law because he did not honor the traditions of men as equal to the law of god he regularly locked horns with the religious leaders of the day because he would not conform to their rules only god s law in the matthew passage jesus is defending his dedication to the law and defending himself against his accusors almost the entire sermon on the mount matt is dedicated to helping the jewish people understand the true intent of the law sweeping away the clutter which had been introduced by the pharasees and their traditions only helping the jewish people in galatians paul describes the relationship of jesus to the law in this way but before faith came we were kept in custody under the law being shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed therefore the law has become our tutor to lead us to christ that we may be justified by faith but now that faith has come we are no longer under a tutor for you are all sons of god through faith in christ jesus i believe this says that after christ was revealed the law had served it s purpose i e our tutor to lead us to christ and now we are no longer under a tutor the law has been fulfilled as christ said he would do you are using your interpretation of paul as an argument against the clear words of jesus god the author of the old law and the christ man jesus are the same personality therefore the old law and the new testament the last will and testament of jesus are based on the same moral principles it makes sense that many of the principles in the old law are re expressed in christianity re expressed care to define that a bit better on the other hand now that the law has fulfilled it s purpose and what are heaven and earth gone away where did they go is all accomplished for example revelations explain please christians relate to god through christ not the law it also makes sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to represent the mysteries of this new relationship i e baptism representing christ s death burial and resurrection rom the lord s supper as a memorial to his sacrifice i cor and sunday as a day of worship commemorating his resurrection matt ff acts again your interpretation of paul versus the clear word of jesus do you see any

re who s next mormons and jews would someone be kind enought to document the exact nature of the evidence against the bd s without reference to hearsay or newsreports i would also like to know more about their past record etc but again based on solid not media reports my reason for asking for such evidence is that last night on larry king live a so called cult expert was interviewed from australia who claimed that it was his evidence which led to the original raid this admission if true raises the nasty possibility that the government acted in good faith which i believe they did on faulty evidence it also raises the possibility that other self proclaimed cult experts were advising them and giving ver poor advice a few years ago anson shupe and david bromley published strange gods the great american cult scare beacon boston and the new vigilantes anti cultists and new religions sage beverly hills both books suggested the possibility of tragic results if self proclaimed cult experts were ever taken seriously perhaps their diagnosis of the anit cult movement needs investigating in light of the waco tragedy

re what part of no don t you understand in apr midway uchicago edu eeb quads uchicago edu e elizabeth bartley writes i can certainly see opposing the amen but that doesn t require opposing a moment of silence i already responded to this on one dimension but afterthoughts cause me to make another independent reply the problem with a moment of silence is that it is not an even handed way of allowing for religion amongst students in the public schools as i noted before muslims need more than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayers they are required by muhammad to do and at least orthodox jewish prayer also has requirements that are not addressed by this there is in fact a highly selective bias towards christian prayer in this moment of silence shit and that is especially bizarre in that christian prayer doesn t need this stuff a christain may pray totally incognito at any time to some extent this is true of muslims and jews as well what i intend in my first paragraph is that there are some characteristic forms of prayer in these religions which do need special times and or behavior which cannot be undertaken without an observer being able taking note of it a christian may pray at any time silently and without any trace of his activity being evident to others that may or may not be true of the other religious traditions amongst us certainly these tend to have some forms of prayer that would evidence differences from american protestant mainstream religion all that a moment of silence does is to allow that one tradition which doesn t need it to have a special place set aside in the public schools there is nothing in christian prayer that requires public forms or rugs or phylacteries or anything else at all visible to the outside world a christian student may and probably does pray at innumerable times during the day without anyone else knowing it that may also be true of non christians i am not claimng otherwise in the moment of silence it would still be difficult for the jews to gather and daven for the muslims to do their ablutions and find qiblah to mecca and engage in the prescribed forms but of course christians can do their thing and therefore the provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that luckily there is a strong jewish presence in this country and i as a christian revere some of the jewish teachers i had in public schools and a growing muslim presence as well i can only hope that the political forces consequent on this will prevent the imposition of christian forms on non christians as far as i can see as a christian there is nothing in this moment of silence campaign but an attempt to use public social pressure to force children to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards christianity and as a christian i must protest such coercion for what it s worth i suspect that the coercion is not really targeted at the non christians it is yet another case of failure amongst christian parents in making their children prayerful so that they want the public schools to teach what they cannot manage to teach despite having all the opportunity in the world to do so if you have taught your children to pray they do not need a moment of silence in school if you have not managed to teach them the moment will only embarrass you give it up michael l siemon i say you are gods sons of the mls panix com most high all of you nevertheless or you shall die like men and fall mls ulysses att com like any prince psalm

theists and objectivity can a theist be truly objective can he be impartial when questioning the truth of his scriptures or will he assume the superstition of his parents when questioning i ve often found it to be the case that the theist will stick to some kind of superstition when wondering about god and his scriptures i ve seen it in the christian the jew the muslim and the other theists alike all assume that their mothers and fathers were right in the aspect that a god exists and with that belief search for their god occasionally the theist may switch religions or aspects of the same religion but overall the majority keep to the belief that some creator was behind the universe s existence i ve known muslims who were once christians and vice versa i ve known christians who were once jewish and vice versa and i ve even known christians who become hindu yet throughout their transition from one faith to another they ve kept this belief in some form of higher being why it usually all has to do with how the child is brought up from the time he is born the theist is brought up with the notion of the truth of some kind of scripture the bible the torah the qur an etc he is told of this wondrous god who wrote or inspired the scripture of the prophets talked about in the scripture of the miracles performed etc he is also told that to question this as children are apt to do is a sin a crime against god and to lose belief in the scrip ture s truth is to damn one s soul to hell thus by the time he is able to read the scripture for himself the belief in its truth is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a matter of course but it doesn t stop there once the child is able to read for himself there is an endeavor to inculcate the child the right readings of scripture to concentrate more on the pleasant readings to gloss over the worse ones and to explain away the unexplainable with mystery circular arguments self evdent facts and truths unreasoning belief and fear of hell is the meat of religion the child must eat of every day to doubt of course means wrath of some sort and the child must learn to put away his brain when the matter concerns god all of this has some considerable effect on the child so that when he becomes an adult the superstitions he s been taught are nearly impossible to remove all of this leads me to ask whether the theist can truly be objective when questioning god hell heaven the angels souls and all of the rest can he for a moment put aside this notion that god does exist and look at everything from a unbiased point of view obviously most theists can somewhat especially when presented with mythical gods homeric roman egyptian etc but can they put aside the assumption of god s existence and question it impartially stephen atheist libertarian pro individuality pro responsibility jr and all that jazz

re the universe and black holes was re years kv iastate edu warren vonroeschlaub writes let s say that we drop a marble into the black hole it races ever faster towards the even horizon but thanks to the curving of space caused by the excessive gravity as the object approaches the event horizon it has further to travel integrating the curve gives a time to reach the event horizon of infinity so the math says that nothing can enter a black hole this is not correct the event horizon is not the center of the black hole but merely the distance at which the escape velocity is equal to the speed of light that is the event horizon is a finite radius keith
re the universe and black holes was re years salem pangea stanford edu bruce salem writes is this zeno s paradox no zeno s paradox is resolved by showing that integration or an infinite series of decreasing terms can sum to a finite result nothing can get out of a black hole because the escape velocity is the speed of light i don t know how time dialation can prevent matter spiraling in from getting to the event horizon can any one explain how matter gets in well suppose a probe emitting radiation at a constant frequency was sent towards a black hole as it got closer to the event horizon the red shift would keep increasing the period would get longer and longer but it would never stop an observer would not observe the probe actually reaching the event horizon the detected energy from the probe would keep decreasing but it wouldn t vanish exp t never quite reaches zero i guess the above probably doesn t make things any more clear but hopefully you will get the general idea maybe keith

edu robert s parker writes deletions soapbox on if it s ok to pay for legal procedures with gov t money then let s get the government to pay for counselling that provides abortion alternatives let s get the government to pay for adoption fees let s get the government to pay for all the things that make abortion necessary why not they are certainly legal procedures counselling that only provides alternatives to abortion would be just as biased as counselling that only provides abortion information how about providing counselling that will give a woman help in finding what she is comfortable with your adoption funding idea may be a good one any idea if it is feasable the only way hell is involved is that it is going to be a good skiing resort before i give in to paying for abortions i believe it is wrong and i won t pay for it without a gripe i m not for making them unlawful i d rather spend money on saving lives than a bunch of investigations and court hearings and all this other crap we are spending our time on you know who s really cleaning up on all this abortion stuff lawyers i say let s pass laws to make adoption cheaper easier and infinitely more supportive of the birth mother let s eradicate the stigma reduce the cost pay the price for life making adoption easier on the birth mother may help reduce abortion but it will not eliminate the need for it abortion is not done just because the mother can t care for the child and doesn t feel good about giving it to strangers abortion is done because the mother can not afford the pregnancy soapbox off a person has a right to do anything that does not interfere with the rights of another person cool enough you ll have more trouble defining the terms in that statement than getting people to agree to it for example i perceive i have a right not to participate in what i feel is murder i don t think the government should either on the other hand since we are having trouble proving that it is murder there is no right to stop someone from doing it if they so choose either by legal means or harassment of course persuasion is allowed but watch that line between persuasive and harassing the second part is a definition of a person a simplistic explanation is that a person is a member of society most normal adult human beings are good examples of people most children over two years old are people as well the simple way of determining this is that you can have a conversation with them it is actually more complicated than that but i have no desire to spend the time it would take to explain it to you read the thread why is bodily autonomy so important for more explanation and justification but why is your definition authoritative enough for the whoe us surely you can understand there are other definitions with equal right of consideration then please justify why being human automatically makes something valuable and why that includes the unborn if the government refused to fun abortions due to the qualms of a minority of the population then it would then have to pay far more in the delivery of babies whose mothers wanted an abortion but could not afford one and now that baby will also require care for years true that needs to be fixed it is part of the problem if clinton has a medical program to get underway let him address this too it is cheaper in the long run to save lives later they will be productive members of society at least if his plan works no they are not guaranteed to become productive members of society even if they do that is many years in the future until which they are a burden on someone or society there is also the matter of the mother forcing her to carry a pregnancy to term at a critical time in her life could prevent her from being a productive member of society actually i was refering to the minority that objects to abortion not those who object to federal funding i admit i did not say it very clearly and apologize for that to refuse to fund abortions is to remove that choice from some women and add the additional burden to society for no reason no this is really flawed logic it would be like me saying i was born with a disfigured face and i want cosmetic repair it is discriminatory that i cannot make that choice and so you must pay for it that a person has a right to make a choice does not imply legally or otherwise that someone else should foot the bill sic for that choice ok look it s like this we are footing the bill maybe they will take choice a maybe they will take choice b maybe they will take choice c they can t afford any one of them if they take choice a we d have to pay them say if they take choice b it would cost us if they take choice c it will cost us now and a hell of a lot more for the next years which one sounds the most realistic for us to be willing to pay for now some people happen not to like choice a other people happen not to like choice c paying for it that is c has been around and paid for for years even though it means we spend a lot of money we can t in conscience refuse to pay for it now a has been around and is perfectly legal but it hasn t been funded in the past now a is going to be funded but some people object they don t like the idea of their tax money going to pay for choice a so we could refuse to fund a at all then those women who can t afford any of those choices will be forced to take choice b or c which will cost all of us more money most of us don t see any reason at all why more money should be spent to the effect of removing personal choice from some women the alternative is to fund a if that is what the mother chooses we will also still fund b and even c if that is what the mother chooses however some women will certainly choose a and that will then save us we otherwise would have had to spend your taxes are not being raised to fund a choice you object they are being lowered because we will fund a choice that is legal despite your objections to it actually your taxes are not really going to go down as i m sure you would point out but the amount that is saved in that area can help out in another like our massive debt if you disagree then give us some reasons given that abortion is legal and the right to abortion is supported by the majority of the population it is not justifiable to refuse abortions to women who can not afford them who will simply require even greater funds for the delivery you would force upon them i refuse to pay more taxes to remove choice from those women just because you object to a legal medical procedure what i say objection to the procedure is irrelevant uncle bill doesn t pay for breast augmentation facelifts etc why abortions it s elective surgery those other procedures you mention only cost money there is no savings in other procedures that would be required down the road without them in fact there could be additional costs down the road because of them this is quite different from the case of abortion as for your argument you are enticing a young girl to kill a baby by making it affordable and refusing to make the alternative affordable too so you are just as guilty of removing a choice by withholding funds think about it a poor girl is pregnant and abortions are federally funded what s she gonna do what choice have your plans given her your kind of double talk really makes me ill this is bullshit we are not refusing to make the alternative affordable too if we refused to pay for the more expensive choice of birth then your statement would make sense but that is not the case so it doesn t if clinton tried to block funding for pre natal care and delivery or left it out of his health care plan i would certainly object i would also be quite surprised pro choice ha pro abortion really fits in your case yes but probably not your definition of it or for the reasons you think if you re gonna fund one choice you have to fund them all at the very least you stupid fuck we do want to fund all the choices you are the one who wants to not fund all the choices imho if we fund the adoption choice right meaning not just throwing money at it but cutting costs esp legal costs we won t need abortion anymore your humble opinion is still wrong even with easy adoption there is still the fact that pregnancy takes several months months in which a young woman could need to be getting an education like finishing high school entering college finishing college getting a job things that are much harder to do if you have to take a break for a few months things that have a massive impact on her future productivity have a right to life a fetus is not a person you can not have a conversation with them ah let s kill the mentally incompetant as well or how about people we just don t like since we can t have a conversation with them you can have a conversation with the mentally incompetant and even though you personally may refuse to have a conversation with people you just don t like it is still possible for others to have a conversation with them it is not possible for anyone to have a conversation with a fetus they are not biologically independent nor was my son at the age of weeks he was breastfed and would not take a bottle just what does biologically independent mean i ll be happy to punch any definition full of loopholes he was still biologically independent at least to the same extent you are now he consumed nutrients and digested them in the normal manner he breathed his own air a fetus on the other hand gets it s nutrients already digested by the mother it gets its oxygen from the mother as well that is not biologically independent their awareness is questionable aha you admit it is questionable yet you are willing to kill it even if it may be very aware i suggest you re think your viewpoint awareness is only part of what makes a member of society it is the minimal conceivable requirement yet many people seem to think that something without awareness could still be important enough to justify the suffereing of a true member of society i keep asking but i still haven t seen a real justification for why the life of a non sentient creature should be worth the suffering of a sentient being i haven t read every response on the threads i ve been asking on yet so we ll see if i see one later they have no experiences in the real world to make up a

re theists and objectivity trajan cwis unomaha edu stephen mcintyre writes can a theist be truly objective can he be impartial when questioning the truth of his scriptures or will he assume the superstition of his parents when questioning i think that if a theist were truly objective and throws out the notion that god definitely exists and starts from scratch to prove to themselves that the scriptures are the whole truth then that person would no longer be a theist it usually all has to do with how the child is brought up from the time he is born the theist is brought up with the notion of the truth of some kind of scripture the bible the torah the qur an etc he is told of this wondrous god who wrote or inspired the scripture of the prophets talked about in the scripture of the miracles performed etc he is also told that to question this as children are apt to do is a sin a crime against god and to lose belief in the scrip ture s truth is to damn one s soul to hell thus by the time he is able to read the scripture for himself the belief in its truth is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a matter of course you re missing something here there are people who convert from non theism to theism after being brought up in a non theist household i don t have any statistics as to how many though that would be an interesting thing to know i think that religion is a crutch people are naturally afraid of the unknown and the unexplainable people don t want to believe that when they die they are dead finished that there is nothing else after that and so religion is kind of a nice fantasy religion also describes things we don t know about the universe things science has not yet described and it also gives people a feeling of security that if they just do this one thing and everything will be ok that they are being watched over by a higher power and its minions this has a very high psychological attraction for quite a few people and these people are willing to put up with a few discrepancies and holes in their belief system for what it gains them this is why i think it s kind of useless to try too hard to convert theists to atheism they are happy with their fantasy and they feel that other people will be happy with it too they can t accept the fact that there are people who would rather accept the harsh reality that they are running from anyway i m getting kind of carried away here but my point is that theism doesn t have to be ingrained into a child s mindset for that person to grow up as a theist although this happens far too often theism is designed to have its own attractions atheist libertarian pro individuality pro responsibility jr and all that jazz nanci if you know and are sure of the author of this quote please send me email nm w andrew cmu edu if you are one in a million then there are and a half of you in nyc

re ancient references to christianity was albert sabin actually if mr x had something to gain by his claims his account of the events would nmot be the most respected case and point the resurrection by claiming that the resurrection actually happened the early preachers were able to convert many to christianity however if you read mathew and the case for the resurrected saints who walked around jerusalem and appeared to many people you would realize that other historians josephus for one would have reported on it all if it happened the fact that the bible speaks of events of such great magnitude that they would have been noticed taken with the fact that they are not reported on by historians could only mean that the bible contains many made up stories

re christian meta ethics russell turpin as is his wont has raised some interesting issues in his struggle with the christian texts and the christians unfortunately he seems to be hoping for simplicity where it is not available the lukewarm stew he detects may well be an inevitable result of the divine mixing himself up with a bunch of losers such as humanity also unfortunately perhaps i have a deadline in two weeks the responsibility for which prevents me in good conscience from writing a more considered response and fully entering the fray as it were let me then say what i can briefly the two commandments are rules they are merely rules that are so vague that they are practically devoid of meaning this point for the net browsers who also still read books is pursued throughly in kaufmann critique of religion and philosophy the commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed in part as reminding man that he is not god and cannot act as if he has ultimate responsibility this is a theological statement worthy of barth dr turpin dd may wear the black robe of geneva yet indeed many traditions present an interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret loving one s neighbor as following various other rules and relying on their god to make things come out right precisely because it would be wrong for man to assume such ultimate responsibility once again we are confronted with good sounding goo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean this requires the assumption that all interpretations are equally valid that there is no way of reasonably distinguishing among them i wouldn t make that assumption i don t think it is a reasonable assumption and who is to say that this interpretation is twisted there are many passages in the bible that in their most straightforward reading show the christian god behaving in just this way michael and i and others read the bible with christian glasses among the things that this should imply is that the nt informs the ot even to the point of dominanting it some points in the ot ceremonial dietary laws are explicitly abrogated by the nt texts to drive russell turpin s point with adequacy one needs to begin with nt texts probably from matthew and probably about damnation just trying to help this part is i discover what most moves me to post mls i am a radical christian only in that i take the gospel seriously no michael the conservative christians also take the gospel seriously what differentiates you is the way you interpret the gospel russell turpin s no here is misplaced not to say inappropriate michael s self description much govern the equation of radical liberal which seems implied by russell turpin is wrong radical conservatives are possible if sadly lacking in numbers at present thomas merton was a radical even though conservative in some ways st francis was a radical similarly how many examples are needed mls why don t i and the myriads of other christians like me mls tell you something about christianity michael s question gets to a heart of the matter klingons have two hearts so my metaphor is not mixed just extraterrestrial russell turpin in an earlier post had said that michael michael s theological positions actually didn t tell him much about christianity dean simeon responds this time gently what do you mean more direct perhaps would have been what could you possibly mean the implied rhetorical effort to separate michael from the tradition is a failure michael is in the tradition if your idea of the tradition doesn t include him change your idea of the tradition the irony here is that there is nothing in christianity per se that michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and gays how can one answer this while staying on the more general issue i m on the other side of the interpretive fence from michael on this issue yet nothing is a hideous overstatement one verse is enough to refute it i ll offer two from paul of all people in jesus christ there is neither male nor female galatians i don t quote single verses as a rule and i don t carry them in my head and nothing shall separate us from the glory of god roughly from romans if russell would promise to convert based on these or any other verses i d promise to get the full context for any that he requires in short it is the extra christian principles that make michael s christianity beneficial and i suspect they would be as beneficial perhaps moreso without being filtered by christian interpretation this conclusion does not follow even in short from the argument that goes before a surprising logical ellipsis dave davis ddavis ma bull com these are my opinions activities alone qotd wild beasts trapped in their cages are not so fierce as are the christians to each other julian the apostate c

no knock was re who s next mormons and jews isaackuo skippy berkeley edu isaac kuo states in reply to deleted article about no knock searches arrests hmm the police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn clearly marked as officers and yelling police repeatedly this is used every day to bust drug houses the idea is to awe the suspects into submission with surprise and display of firepowere in order to avoid a gun fight as for not knocking it s a sad necessity in many cases since the suspects will attempt to escape or even fight usually this strategy works if it didn t then it wouldn t be used so commonly now would it in general no knock raids are to preserve evidence like drugs which can be flushed down the toilet they are not the standard way to arrest a violent felon like a bank robber if there is no need to search or preserve evidence they will just surround the dwelling and order the suspect to come out with her hands up if the suspect does not come out tear gas will be used comment on the bd omitted i merely point out that it is a valid strategy which is used every day furthermore we don t know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects do you suggest it is not a method to apprehend criminals that the police always knock with guns holstered and never arrest any suspects until they have been allowed to inspect the officers s badges just what should the police do when apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects how far can they reasonably go to identity themselves what do you suggest they can do which can t be faked by the competition it is a very dangerous method to obtain evidence that might be destroyed if a warrant is served in the normal way it is the most dangerous way to arrest anyone the cops are charging into a room and they don t know what is in it it is much safer to surround the place and announce yourself even if you ve got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops that s not an excuse to murder police in the case of the bd s there was almost definitely at most the paranoid delusion of deadly enimies who would pretend to be cops cops are not cops until they identify themselves as police officers most drug dealers and professional criminals are aware of the likelihood of arrest but they also know how the system works if they are arrested they call their lawyer post bail and hope for a plea bargain if they pull a gun and shoot a cop during a raid they will be charged with first degree murder if they survive the raid drug dealers have guns for protection from their customers and other criminals not to shoot cops cops are shot on no knock drug raids because the criminals aren t aware that they are cops no knock raids on homes occupied by non criminals are more likely to end in disaster mom and pop citizen know that they have not committed any crime they know that anyone breaking into their house cannot be a cop because they have done nothing wrong if they have the means to defend themselves they may because they know that the housebreakers are criminals not cops cops and homeowners may die the first reports from waco stated that the atf had a warrant to search for illegal weapons and also an arrest warrant if the illegal weapons were found in this case the no knock warrant was not called for it is difficult to flush a gun down the toilet the atf could have surrounded the compound a marked police car could have driven up to the entrance and uniformed officers could have knocked and served the warrant usual way it this had happened and and koresh refused the warrant or drove the cops off at gun point then most of the t p g folks would have kept quiet rod anderson n nzo i do not think the united states government boulder co is responsible for the fact that a bunch of rcanders nyx cs du edu fanatics decided to kill themselves satellite n nzo on ao slick willie the compassionate

re rw is robert weiss the only orthodox christian in article librba byuvm bitnet librba byuvm bitnet writes robert you keep making references to orthodox belief and saying things like it is held that cf kermit thread on what exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call orthodox who is that holds that luke meant what you said he meant whenever your personal interpretation of biblical passages is challenged your only response seems to be that one needs merely to look at the bible in order to see the truth but what of those who see biblical things differently from you are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really understands it rick i think we can safely say robert is not the only person who understands the bible and the leadership of the lds church historicly never has let s consider some personal interpretations and see how much trust we should put in orthodox mormonism which could never be confused with orthodox christianity in one of his attacks on christians the mormon apostle bruce r mcconkie said they thrash around in darkness in trying to identify elohim and jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised messiah he also said christians are wrong to believe that jehovah is the supreme deity god the father and that christ came into mortality as his only begotten son mcconkie then stated what mormons believe today to be the truth about the matter he said that elohim is the father and jehovah is the son being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists have gone in defining their three in one god it comes as no surprise to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to identify elohim and jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised messiah some sectarians even believe that jehovah is the supreme deity whose son came into mortality as the only begotten as with their concept that god is a spirit this misinformation about the gods of heaven is untrue the fact is and it too is attested by holy writ that elohim is the father and that jehovah is the son who was born into mortality as the lord jesus christ the promised messiah promised messiah p notice that mcconkie said the christians are as wrong about their three in one god and their belief that god is a spirit as they are in their understanding of who elohim and jehovah are before examining mcconkie s attack and its validity we shall read a few more statements by mcconkie and other mormon sources concerning the words elohim and jehovah mcconkie stated the chief designation of christ that has been preserved for us in the old testament as that ancient work is now published is the exalted name title jehovah promised messiah p elohim plural word though it is is also used as the exalted name title of god the eternal father a usage that connotes his supremacy and omnipotence he being god above all gods mormon doctrine p agreeing with mcconkie on the question of who elohim and jehovah are the apostle james e talmage stated elohim as understood and used in the restored church of jesus christ is the name title of god the eternal father whose firstborn son in the spirit is jehovah the only begotten in the flesh jesus christ jesus the christ p a doctrinal exposition by the first presidency and the twelve apostles of the mormon church states that god the eternal father is designate d by the exalted name title elohim articles of faith p christ in his preexistent antemortal or unembodied state was known as jehovah articles of faith p today mormon leaders teach that elohim in the ot refers to god the father and jehovah refers to christ mcconkie attacked christians for saying jehovah can refer to the father he stressed that these two name titles should not be changed around so that christ is called elohim and the father is called jehovah the father is elohim not jehovah jehovah is christ and christ is jehovah they are one and the same person promised messiah p in the ot of the kjv of the bible the hebrew word elohim is used to refer to the true god false gods and goddesses and the judges of israel when referring to the true god elohim is translated with a capital g when referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges of israel it is translated with a small g it is translated four times as judges exod once as judge sam twice as mighty gen exod once as angels ps once as godly mal once as great gen and once as very great sam the word jehovah is the traditional pronunciation of the tetragrammation yhwh or yhvh with the vowel points taken from the word adonai many people believe the true pronunciation of the tetragrammation was yahweh or yahveh however since jehovah rather than yahweh is the word used by mormonism this section will also use jehovah instead of yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of mormon leaders regarding that name jehovah unlike elohim is never used of false gods it is the personal name of the triune god of the bible in the kjv jehovah is rendered primarily lord sometimes god and rarely lord now that we understand something about the words elohim and jehovah and their use by mormon leaders we shall consider the apostle mcconkie s attack on christians for believing the father is jehovah in trying to prove that jehovah refers exclusively to christ mcconkie cited several verses from the bible some of these verses and mcconkie s interpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right remember mcconkie said the father is not jehovah he is only elohim the first example we shall consider involves mcconkie s interpretation of ps of this verse he stated of whom spake david when his tongue was touched by the holy spirit and he testified the lord said unto my lord sit thou at my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool ps two lords are here involved one is speaking to the other one is greater than the other one is making provision for the triumph and glory of the other who are they and what message is contained in this messianic prophecy what think ye of christ our lord asked certain of his detractors toward the end of his mortal ministry whose son is he is christ the son of god or of someone else is he to be born of a divine parent or will he be as other men a mortal son of a mortal father that he was to be a descendant of david was a matter of great pride to all the jews and so they answered the son of david david s son truly he was but he was more much more and so our lord with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture asked how then doth david in spirit call him lord saying the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies thy footstool if david then call him lord how is he his son that is if he is only the son of david how is it that the great king acting under inspiration calls him lord and worships him as such and we might add who is the other lord the one who spake unto david s lord can there be any question as to how jesus is interpreting the words of the psalm he is saying that it means the father said unto the son elohim said unto jehovah sit thou on my right hand until after your mortal ministry then i will raise you up to eternal glory and exaltation with me where you will continue to sit on my right hand forever promised messiah pp emphasis added agreeing with the above statement by mcconkie the following remark in the mormon pamphlet what the mormons think of christ p reads the lord elohim the father said unto my lord jehovah the son brackets in original mcconkie clearly stated that it is elohim the father who is speaking to jehovah the son in this psalm however when one looks at the hebrew word translated lord it becomes apparent that either the first lord is not the father or else the father is jehovah either way mcconkie is wrong the psalm reads the lord jehovah said unto my lord adon sit thou at my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool ps the first lord in this verse is jehovah who mormonism says is christ not the father the second lord is the hebrew word adon singular for adonai meaning master or lord if the first lord is the father and the second lord is the son then the father is jehovah and the son is adon however if the father is not jehovah as mcconkie claimed then the first lord is jehovah the son but who then is adon obviously the father is jehovah in this psalm and his son is adon another example involves isa about which mcconkie stated the following i the lord have called thee in righteousness isaiah quoted the father as saying of christ and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the gentiles isa promised messiah p emphasis added mcconkie said the father was speaking of christ in this passage which reads i the lord jehovah have called thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the gentiles isa according to mcconkie i the lord refers to the father and thine and thee refer to christ however the lord who is speaking is jehovah which means either mcconkie was wrong about who is speaking or else the father is jehovah another example involves ps of these verses mcconkie stated the same psalm says all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying he trusted on the lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him ps the fulfillment as jesus hung on the cross is found in these words the chief priests mocking him with the scribes and elders said he saved others himself he cannot save if he be the king of israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him he trusted in god let him deliver him now if he will have him for he said i am the son of god the thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth matt promised messiah pp emphasis added ps reads as follows all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying he trusted on the lord jehovah that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him mcconkie said these verses had their fulfillment as jesus hung on the cross that means the person who was scorned in these verses was christ who then was the lord in whom he trusted it was jehovah the father another example involves ps and ps regarding them mcconkie stated the following with reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our lord s arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was they took counsel together against me they devised to take away my life ps as to the role of judas in those conspiracies the psalmist says mine own familiar friend in whom i trusted which did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel against me ps promised messiah p apostle mcconkie said these psalms refer to christ s arrest and judicial trials we shall first consider ps and then ps while mcconkie only quoted verse of ps verse will also be included to give a complete understanding of the matter for i have heard the slander of many fear was on every side while they took counsel together against me they devised to take away my life but i trusted in thee o lord jehovah i said thou art my god elohim ps mcconkie said verse referred to jesus christ verse goes on to tell that he christ trusted in the lord who is called his god or elohim mormonism teaches that the god above jesus is elohim the father verse however reveals that the elohim of the man jesus is jehovah the father in ps mcconkie only quoted one verse however two verses will be considered in this examination yea mine own familiar friend in whom i trusted which did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel against me but thou o lord jehovah be merciful unto me and raise me up that i may requite them ps mcconkie stated above that verse referred to judas role in christ s death since it was judas who was the familiar friend who lifted up his heel the pronouns mine i my and me in verse must refer to christ notice that at the beginning of verse there is a change of pronoun to thou which refers to the lord jehovah then the pronouns me and i which refer to christ are used again that means christ was speaking to jehovah the father in these verses another example involves mcconkie s following remark about ps one of the great messianic prophecies spoken by the mouth of david says the lord hath sworn and will not repent thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek ps promised messiah p mcconkie admitted this is a messianic prophecy involving christ the question is what in this verse refers to christ the lord jehovah hath sworn and will not repent thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek ps does the lord which is jehovah refer to christ if mcconkie is right and jesus is jehovah but the father is not then the lord would have to refer to christ but who then is the one addressed as the priest forever after the order of melchizedek the bible reveals that the one referred to is jesus christ heb therefore the lord jehovah in ps is the father another example involves isa of these verses mcconkie stated of the atoning sacrifice of the future messiah isaiah said the lord has laid on him the iniquities of us all it pleased the lord to bruise him promised messiah p emphasis added mcconkie rightly said these verses refer to the atoning sacrifice of the future messiah however what he failed to mention is that they also prove that the father is jehovah verse reads all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord jehovah hath laid on him christ the iniquity of us all and verse reads yet it pleased the lord jehovah to bruise him christ obviously the lord who laid on christ the iniquity of us all and who bruised him is god the father who is called jehovah in these verses remember mcconkie stated that some sectarians even believe that jehovah is the supreme deity and that christ came into mortality as his only begotten son he called this concept misinformation that is untrue to prove that it is mcconkie who is misinformed and believing untruth two scriptural references sam ps will be examined mcconkie stated the following regarding these scriptures in the midst of a passage that is clearly messianic the lord says of the seed of david i will be his father and he shall be my son sam in the second psalm the whole of which is also clearly messianic occurs this statement thou art my son this day have i begotten thee ps paul quotes both of these statements in hebrews and says they are prophecies that christ would come as the son of god promised messiah p mcconkie cited heb to show that sam and ps refer to christ who would come as the son of god since mcconkie first referenced sam this examination will too however along with verse verses will also be included and as since the time that i commanded judges to be over my people israel and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies also the lord jehovah telleth thee that he will make thee an house and when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers i will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels and i will establish his kingdom he shall build an house for my name and i will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever i will be his father and he shall be my son sam these verses teach that the lord jehovah would have a son the messiah in the second example mcconkie cited ps this examination will include verse notice that it is the lord jehovah who says thou art my son this day have i begotten thee i will declare the decree the lord jehovah hath said unto me thou art my son this day have i begotten thee ask of me and i shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession mcconkie said these verses of scripture are clearly messianic and he acknowledged they teach that christ would come as the son of god what he is not willing to acknowledge however is that these scriptures also teach that the father is jehovah and that the sectarians who believe jehovah is the supreme deity whose son is jesus christ the only begotten are right in their belief another example involves mic of this verse mcconkie stated the following and so truly did our lord act during his mortal ministry truly this is he of whom it is written he shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord in the majesty of the name of the lord his god for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth mic promised messiah p emphasis added according to mcconkie the pronoun he at the beginning of mic refers to christ during his mortal ministry who then is the lord his god mic reads and he christ shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord jehovah in the majesty of the name of the lord jehovah his god elohim for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth obviously the lord of jesus christ is jehovah the father who is referred to as jehovah his elohim another example involves ps and isa of these verses mcconkie stated the following a number of messianic passages speak of the lord and his anointed ps signifying that the chosen one was consecrated and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his jesus applied these passages to himself by quoting isaiah s prophecy the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek isa and then saying this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears luke promised messiah pp emphasis added the first source mcconkie quoted ps reads as follows the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the lord jehovah and against his anointed mcconkie said the anointed one was christ if that is true who was jehovah if jehovah is always christ who was the anointed one obviously jehovah is referring to god the father and the anointed is indeed referring to christ the second source mcconkie cited is isa which states the spirit of the lord adonai god jehovah is upon me because the lord jehovah hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound the one who was anointed to preach bind up proclaim and open was jesus christ who then was the one who anointed him this verse says the lord jehovah did the anointing again we face the same problem if jehovah does not refer to the father but only to christ then jesus anointed someone but who as mcconkie pointed out jesus applied these passages to himself therefore the jehovah who anointed christ is god the father other examples could be cited to show that mcconkie and other mormon leaders are wrong when they say god the father is not jehovah however these should be enough to expose their error now what about mormonism s claim that jesus is jehovah but he is not elohim it is true that jesus is jehovah the following scriptures prove this fact thus saith the lord jehovah the king of israel and his redeemer the lord jehovah of hosts i am the first and i am the last and beside me there is no god isa jesus said i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead rev saith the lord jehovah they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son zech behold he christ cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him rev i am the lord jehovah thy god the holy one of israel isa ye denied the holy one christ and the just acts and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord jehovah shall be delivered joel the name of jesus christ of nazareth there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved acts behold the lord god jehovah will come with strong hand his reward is with him isa behold i christ come quickly and my reward is with me rev the lord jehovah my god shall come and all the saints with thee zech at the coming of our lord jesus christ with all his saints thess the lord jehovah is my shepherd ps jesus said i am the good shepherd john saith the lord god jehovah i will seek that which was lost ezek the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost luke for i am the lord jehovah thy god the holy one of israel thy saviour isa looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus christ tit see also jer and rev mal and heb kin and john isa and tim ps and matt prov and rev while mormons are right when they say jesus is jehovah they are wrong when they say he is not elohim the bible reveals that jehovah is the only true elohim there is all others are false remember jehovah is the personal name of the triune god who has revealed himself in the bible before we consider biblical quotes which show that jehovah and elohim are not two separate gods as mormons claims let us first note that not only are both god the father and christ addressed as jehovah and elohim but so is the holy spirit whereof the holy ghost said this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more heb emphasis on holy ghost and said added behold the days come saith the lord jehovah that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah i will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their god elohim and they shall be my people i will forgive their iniquity and i will remember their sin no more jer emphasis added for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost pet emphasis on holy ghost added the spirit of the lord jehovah spake by me and his word was in my tongue sam see also heb with ps let us now continue with the biblical quotes which show that jehovah and elohim are not two separate gods as mormons claim and when the lord jehovah saw that he moses turned aside to see god elohim called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he said here am i bruce r mcconkie acknowledged that it was christ s voice that spoke to moses in the burning bush promised messiah p and the lord jehovah said and moses said unto god elohim behold when i come unto the children of israel and shall say unto them the god elohim of your fathers hath sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall i say unto them and god elohim said unto moses i am that i am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am hath sent me unto you and god elohim said moreover unto moses thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel the lord jehovah god elohim of your fathers the god elohim of abraham the god elohim of isaac and the god elohim of jacob hath sent me unto you this is my name for ever and this is my memorial unto all generations exod and god elohim spake unto moses and said unto him i am the lord jehovah exod i am the lord jehovah and there is none else there is no god elohim beside me i girded thee though thou hast not known me isa but the lord jehovah is the true god elohim he is the living god elohim and an everlasting king jer thus saith the lord jehovah the king of israel and his redeemer the lord jehovah of hosts i am the first and i am the last and beside me there is no god elohim isa therefore will i cause you to go into captivity beyond damascus saith the lord jehovah whose name is the god elohim of hosts amos behold the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the lord s jehovah s thy god elohim the earth also with all that therein is deut wherefore thou art great o lord jehovah god elohim for there is none like thee neither is there any god elohim beside thee according to all that we have heard with our ears sam and he said unto them i am an hebrew and i fear the lord jehovah the god elohim of heaven which hath made the sea and the dry land jon for who is god elohim save the lord jehovah or who is a rock save our god elohim ps blessed is the nation whose god elohim is the lord jehovah ps see also ps hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting god elohim the lord jehovah the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding isa the mighty god elohim even the lord jehovah hath spoken and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof ps sing unto god elohim sing praises to his name estol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name jah and rejoice before him ps regarding the word jah bruce r mcconkie stated jah hebrew yah is a contracted form of jehovah jahveh or yahweh all of which names have reference to christ the god of israel mormon doctrine p and david arose and went with all the people that were with him from baale of judah to bring up from thence the ark of god elohim whose name is called by the name of the lord jehovah of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims sam the great the mighty god elohim the lord jehovah of hosts is his name jer o my god elohim make them like a wheel as the stubble before the wind fill their faces with shame that they may seek thy name o lord jehovah that men may know that thou whose name alone is jehovah art the most high over all the earth ps the bible clearly teaches that jehovah is elohim in fact he is the only elohim there is he is the true the living the mighty the great and the everlasting elohim he is the elohim of israel of all the kingdoms of the earth and of the heavens he is the creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and all that dwell thereon jehovah s name is elohim of hosts amos not only is jehovah elohim but elohim is jehovah the bible reveals that elohim s name is jah ps jehovah ps and jehovah of hosts sam jer the nation whose elohim is jehovah is blessed ps clearly this is not the jehovah and elohim of the mormons another mormon error regarding elohim and jehovah is the belief that elohim not jehovah is the father of all the spirits including jesus in the articles of faith by apostle james e talmage a doctrinal exposition by the first presidency and the twelve apostles states that god the eternal father elohim is the literal parent of the spirits of the human race p this doctrinal exposition also states explicitly that jesus christ is not the father of the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth for he is one of them he is the son as they are sons and daughters of elohim p the apostle talmage stated that elohim is the name title of god the eternal father whose firstborn son in the spirit is jehovah jesus the christ p the apostle bruce r mcconkie stated the following about this matter jehovah christ did in fact create the earth and all forms of plant and animal life on the face thereof but when it came to placing man on earth there was a change in creators that is the father himself became personally involved all things were created by the son using the power delegated by the father except man in the spirit and again in the flesh man was created by the father there was no delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was concerned promised messiah p emphasis added mormon leaders claim that jehovah christ did not create either man s spirit or his body they maintain that the mormon elohim who is the father created man both in spirit and body the bible reveals the truth about who created man and moses spake unto the lord jehovah saying let the lord jehovah the god elohim of the spirits of all flesh set a man over the congregation num see also emphasis added the lord jehovah which stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth the foundation of the earth and formeth the spirit of man within him zech emphasis added the lord jehovah made us this soul jer for i will not contend for ever neither will i be always wroth for the spirit should fail before me and the souls which i have made saith the lord jehovah isa emphasis on souls i have made added behold i am the lord jehovah the god elohim of all flesh jer emphasis added thus saith the lord jehovah thy redeemer and he that formed thee from the womb i am the lord jehovah that maketh all things isa emphasis added thus saith the lord jehovah i have made the earth and created man upon it isa emphasis added god elohim created man upon the earth unto thee it was shewed that thou mightest know that the lord jehovah he is god elohim there is none else beside him deut thus saith god el the lord jehovah he that spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon it and spirit to them that walk therein isa thus saith the lord jehovah of hosts the god elohim of israel i have made the earth the man and the beast that are upon the ground jer most emphasis added the bible reveals that it is jehovah who is the elohim of the spirits of all flesh and of all flesh itself that it was he who formed the spirit of man within him that he made us this soul and formed us from the womb he did indeed create man if mormon leaders are right when they say jesus is jehovah then they are wrong when they say he did not create man if they are right when they say the father is the one who created man then they are wrong when they say he is not jehovah although mormon leaders teach that jesus did not create man mormon scriptures teach that he did the bom states the following behold i am jesus christ i am the father and the son and never have i showed myself unto man whom i have created for never has man believed in me as thou hast behold this body which ye now behold is the body of my spirit and man have i created after the body of my spirit eth emphasis added for it is i that taketh upon me the sins of the world for it is i that hath created them mos emphasis added the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob is that same god who created the heavens and the earth and all things that in them are behold he created adam mor emphasis added d c states that the worlds were made by him christ men were made by him all things were made by him and through him and of him emphasis added another error by bruce r mcconkie involving jehovah and his creation is the belief that jehovah had many pre mortal spirits helping him create included in this alleged group was joseph smith jr that he christ was aided in the creation of this earth by many of the noble and great spirit children of the father is evident from abraham s writings unto those superior spirits christ said we will go down for there is space there and we will take of these materials and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell abra michael or adam was one of these enoch noah abraham moses peter james and john joseph smith and many other noble and great ones played a part in the great creative enterprise doctrines of salvation vol pp mormon doctrine p the bible reveals the truth about this matter thus saith the lord jehovah thy redeemer and he that formed thee from the womb i am the lord jehovah that maketh all things that stretcheth forth the heavens alone that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself isa which alone spreadeth out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves of the sea job jehovah by himself created all things he had no alleged preexistent spirit helpers assisting him regarding the mormon elohim the apostle mcconkie stated elohim plural word though it is is also used as the exalted name title of god the eternal father a usage that connotes his supremacy and omnipotence he being god above all gods mormon doctrine p he also stated that jesus is above all save the father only promised messiah p the bible states that the one who is god above all so called gods is the triune god jehovah for the lord jehovah is a great god el and a great king above all gods elohim ps for thou lord jehovah art high above all the earth thou art exalted far above all gods elohim ps now i know that the lord jehovah is greater than all gods elohim exod see also ps deut if mormon leaders are right when they say jehovah is god the son and elohim is god the father these verses from the bible would be teaching that the mormon son is above his father however as mcconkie clearly stated mormons believe elohim the father not jehovah the son is the god above all gods that jesus is above all except the father yet the bible teaches that jehovah is above all elohim at a byu dev on march bruce r mcconkie made the following remark about praying to jesus another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly to christ because of some special friendship they feel has been developed this is plain sectarian nonsense our prayers are addressed to the father and to him only perfect prayer is addressed to the father in the name of the son it is uttered by the power of the holy ghost our relationship with the lord pp mcconkie states on p of his book promised messiah that the mormons pray to the father not the son on p of the same book mcconkie states that christ the son is jehovah this is important to remember because although mcconkie said prayer is not to be offered to the mormon christ who is jehovah the bible states repeatedly in the ot that people prayed to jehovah and he not only heard those prayers but he accepted them as valid requests the following is but a small sample of the vast number of times people prayed to jehovah in my distress i called upon the lord jehovah and cried unto my god elohim he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came before him even into his ears ps and the lord jehovah said unto him i have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast made before me i have hallowed this house which thou hast built to put my name there for ever and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually kin and said unto jeremiah the prophet let we beseech thee our supplication be accepted before thee and pray for us unto the lord jehovah thy god elohim even for all this remnant jer o lord jehovah i beseech thee let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy name neh and it was so that when solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the lord jehovah he arose from before the altar of the lord jehovah from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven kin he went in therefore and shut the door upon them twain and prayed unto the lord jehovah kin go and say to hezekiah thus saith the lord jehovah the god elohim of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will add unto thy days fifteen years isa i acknowledge my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have i not hid i said i will confess my transgressions unto the lord jehovah and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin for this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found ps notice above in ps that the godly pray to jehovah according to mcconkie and other mormon leaders that is christ the very one to whom mcconkie said people should not pray the bible reveals there is only one true elohim and his name is jehovah all other elohim are false they are idols that cause their followers to commit adultery against the true elohim and idolatry for the lord jehovah is great and greatly to be praised he is to be feared above all gods elohim for all the gods elohim of the nations are idols but the lord jehovah made the heavens ps thou shalt have no other gods elohim before me exod now i know that the lord jehovah is greater than all gods elohim exod and it shall be if thou do at all forget the lord jehovah thy god elohim and walk after other gods elohim and serve them and worship them i testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish deut thou shalt make no covenant with them nor with their gods elohim they shall not dwell in thy land lest they make thee sin against me for if thou serve their gods elohim it will surely be a snare unto thee exod take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived and ye turn aside and serve other gods elohim and worship them deut that ye come not among these nations these that remain among you neither make mention of the name of their gods elohim nor cause to swear by them neither serve them nor bow yourselves unto them josh neither walk after other gods elohim to your hurt jer but the lord jehovah is the true god elohim he is the living god elohim jer and they forsook the lord jehovah god elohim of their fathers which brought them out of the land of egypt and followed other gods elohim of the gods elohim of the people that were round about them and bowed themselves unto them and provoked the lord jehovah to anger jud shall a man make gods elohim unto himself and they are no gods elohim therefore behold i will this once cause them to know i will cause them to know mine hand and my might and they shall know that my name is the lord jehovah jer and if it seem evil unto you to serve the lord jehovah choose you this day whom ye will serve whether the gods elohim which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods elohim of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the lord jehovah and the people answered and said god elohim forbid that we should forsake the lord jehovah to serve other gods elohim josh these verses teach that the only true living elohim in heaven and on earth is jehovah the triune god who made heaven and earth and all therein jehovah is greater than any elohim because all other elohim are idols the reality behind them is demonic deut jehovah elohim has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding these false elohim he told his people not to have any elohim but him he told the people that if they left him for the false elohim those elohim would be a snare to them and they would be hurt and would perish he warned the people to take heed that their heart be not deceived into worshiping serving swearing by and making covenants with false elohim jehovah elohim told his people he would eventually judge all false elohim and their followers despite these warnings and guidelines elohim s covenant people forsook him and believed in and worshiped the false elohim s of the people they came in contact with ju states that the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord jehovah and served baalim and ashtaroth and the gods elohim of syria and the gods elohim of zidon and the gods elohim of moab and the gods elohim of the children of ammon and the gods elohim of the philistines and forsook the lord jehovah and served not him this examination has shown that the elohim of mormonism like the elohim in ju is not the true jehovah elohim therefore the people who leave the true elohim for the mormon elohim will do evil in the sight of the lord jehovah although mcconkie attacked christians for their belief in a triune god who is spirit and for their belief that god the father jehovah sent his son into the world these beliefs are true god is triune he is spirit he is jehovah and he did send his son into the world to redeem mankind it is obvious from this examination that it is not the christians who thrash around in darkness about who elohim and jehovah are one wonders what holy writ mcconkie had in mind when he stated that it attests to the fact that elohim is the father and that jehovah is the son he certainly did not mean the bible which teaches that the father son and holy spirit are all the one jehovah elohim he apparently did not mean the d c either because chapter verses refer to the father as jehovah summary obviously joseph fielding smith s statement that the mormons have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of god doctrines of salvation is not accurate the mormon gods are not the true god as mormonism claims but are idols which cause their followers to commit adultery against god and idolatry in answer to jesus question but whom say ye that i am mormons say jesus is someone different from the jesus who is revealed in the bible and whom the apostles preached therefore anyone trusting in the mormon jesus is believing in another jesus whom paul warned about bernard p brockbank of the first quorum of the seventy admitted in the may issue of the ensign a mormon publication that the mormon jesus is different from the christian jesus he stated that it is true that many of the christian churches worship a different jesus christ than is worshipped by the mormons or the church of jesus christ of latter day saints p the people who believe in the mormon jesus are committing adultery against god and idolatry they do not have the son therefore they do not have the father and they do not have eternal life as the apostle bruce r mcconkie rightly stated salvation comes only by worshiping the true god promised messiah p mcconkie also rightly stated that the mere worship of a god who has the proper scriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and living god because the true names of deity can be applied to false concepts of god mormon doctrine p remember that the apostle stephen l richards admitted that joseph smith jr gave a new conception of god and the godhead contributions of joseph smith p it is important for the people who have left the true triune god revealed in the bible to repent and return to him they must forsake the sins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in mormonism the bible says all that forsake thee shall be ashamed and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth because they have forsaken the lord jehovah the fountain of living waters jer and it shall be if thou do at all forget the lord jehovah thy god elohim and walk after other gods elohim and serve them and worship them i testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish deut thou shalt make no covenant with their gods elohim exod put away the strange gods elohim that are among you and be clean and change your garments gen flee from idolatry cor it is necessary that christians heed the warnings of the bible if they do they will not fall into the sins of adultery against god and idolatry remember to know the only true god is eternal life john their gods elohim shall be a snare unto you ju see also exod

daniel v zoroaster was the jewish discomfort with jesus in article bd a paranet fidonet org bill carlson p f n z fidonet org bill carlson writes since everywhere i look zoroaster is suggested as being a probable descendant of daniel suppose you prove he wasn t zoroaster is far older than daniel if anything one could claim that in a sense daniel is a descendant of zoroaster as daniel though being hebrew has assimilated into zoroastrianism and has successfully introduced the religion into the tanakh of judaism however the majority of the book is in hellenistic aramaic not babylonian aramaic and only has kethuvim or writing status ref encyclopedia of religion mircea eliade daniel or in hebrew daniyye l hero of the biblical book that bears his name daniel is presented as a jew in the babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in the royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his salvation from death in a lion s pit he also appears in the last chapters of the book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of israel s restoration to national religious autonomy as a practitioner of oneiromancy in the court described in daniel written in the third person daniel per forms his interpretations alone while as a visionary apocalyptist in daniel written in the first person he is in need of an angel to help him decode his visions and mysteries of the future it is likely that the name daniel is pseudonymous a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known from ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition ez the authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative voices and content but by its language daniel a and are written in hebrew whereas daniel b is in aramaic the language division parallels the subject division daniel concerns legends and dream interpretations concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies the overall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances daniel is chiliastically related suggest an attempt at redactional unity after the prefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of daniel and some youths to their ancestral religion a chronological ordering is discernable a sequence from king nebuchadrezzar to darius is reported dn much of this royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic for example daniel speaks of nebuchadrezzar s transformation into a beast a story that is reported in the qumran scrolls of nabonidus belshazzar is portrayed as the last king of babylon although he was never king and darius is called a mede who conquered babylon and is placed before cyrus ii of persia although no such darius is known the medes followed the persians and darius is the name of several persian kings presumably the episodes of daniel depicting a series of monarchical reversals episodes of ritual observances and reports of miraculous deliverances were collected in the seleucid period late fourth to mid second century bce in order to reinvigorate waning jewish hopes in divine providence and encourage steadfast faith the visions of daniel reporting events from the reign of belshazzar to that of cyrus ii but actually predicting the overthrow of seleucid rule in palestine were collected and published during the reign of antiochus iv prior to the maccabean revolt for it was then beginning in bce that the jews were put to the test concerning their allegiance to judaism and their ancestral traditions and many refused to desecrate the statues of moses and endured a martyr s death for their resolute trust in divine dominion all of the visions of daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways for example via images of the enthronement of a god of judgment with a son of man invested with rule this figure was interpreted by jews as michael the archangel and by christians as christ in chapter via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre manifestations as in chapter or via complex reinterpretations of ancient prophecies especially those of jeremiah as found in daniel the imagery of the four beasts in chapter paralleled by the image of four metals in chapter representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth monarchy of divine origin is one of the enduring images of the book it sur vived as a prototype of jewish and christian historical and apocalyptic schemes to the end of the middle ages the role and power of this imagery in the fifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete isaac abravanel the scientist isaac newton and the philosopher jean bodin and among the fifth monarchy men of seventeenth century england for example is abiding testimony to the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of diverse thinkers and groups the schema is still used to this day by various groups predicting the apocalyptic advent the encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and propagandized in daniel contains a remarkable reinterpretation of isaiah regarding the suffering servant of god not as all israel but as the select faithful neither the opening stories about daniel and the youths nor the final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt they rather advocate a stance of piety civil disobedience and trustful resignation victory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel michael and the martyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality persumably the circles behind the book were not the same as the maccabean fighters and may reflect some proto pharisaic group of hasidim or pietists the themes of resistance to oppression freedom of worship preservation of monotheistic integrity the overthrow of historical dominions and the acknowledgement of the god of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of trust for the faithful in their darkest hour zarathushtra founder of the religion know as zoroastrianism or mazdaism from mazda or ahura mazda the name of the god prophesied by zarathushtra the etymology and history of zarathushtra the avestan and oldest form of the name as uncertain both in various iranian languages and in related forms else where there may have been an old persian form zara ushtra from which the greek form zoroastres may be derived and there may have existed an old iranian form zarat ushtra to which may be linked the middle iranian zrdrwsht several middle persian forms such as zrtwsht and the new persian zardusht we can state with certainty only that the second half of the name ushtra means camel the form zoroaster derived from the greek zoroastres was used traditionally in european culture until the eighteenth century when zarathustra closer to the original and as found in nietzsche came into common use after the rediscovery of the avesta the collection of sacred books of zoroastrianism and the resulting studies in iranian philology see avesta notwithstanding the great and continued popularity of zarathushtra even in western culture the sources available to us are few extremely fragmented and heterogeneous our principle sources are the five gathas songs attributed to zarathushtra himself and included in the yasna section of the avesta gatha ahunavaiti yasna gatha ushtavaiti yasna gatha spentamainyu yasna gatha vokukhshathra yasna and gatha vashishtoishti yasna the last of which was probably written after the prophet s death other sources of considerable albeit varying importance are the younger avesta and the remaining zoroastrian religious literature in particular the pahlavi texts of the ninth and tenth centures ce although the achaemenid inscriptions sixth to fourth centures bce never mention zarathushtra he is mentioned by some greek sources of the time not however by herodotus who seems unaware of him the avesta does not provide any direct or explicit data concerning the true chronological history of zarathushtra but the text is useful in an indirect way as it clearly implies that the environment in which zoroastrianism arose was not that of iran under the medes or the persians the greek sources on the other hand do provide some information concerning the time of zarathushtra although from a historical point of view they are unreliable some place him six thousand years before the trojan war xanthus of lydia eudoxus of cnidus hermippus hermodorus aristotle plutarch diogenes laertius and pliny the account by xanthus of lydia however has also been interpreted by some to mean six hundred rather than six thousand years before the expedition of xerxes against greece this interpretation is favored by diogenes laertius who makes reference to xanthus but although a few scholars a s shabazi helmut humbach have recently attempted to rehabilitate it under various pretexts it is generally rejected although the historical value of the greek sources is negligible they are nonetheless important in that they show that the millenarian doctrine of history of the cosmos had already been developed in iran by the achaemenid period as the above account would seem to demonstrate they also show that by this time zarathushtra was already seen as an almost mythical figure one from an extremely distant past all of this leads to the conclusion that the prophet could not have belonged to a historical period contemporary with or even close to that of the achaemenids later zoroastrian sources the pahlavi texts do provide an absolute chrono logy for zarathushtra one that was also accepted by some arab authors accord ing to these sources zarathushtra lived or years before alexander again scholars are divided on the validity of the chronology some view it as historically reliable while others believe that it is devoid of historical justification the most convincing arguments however seem to support the latter position the figure of years is accurate only on the surface because it represents in fact the more general one of which was employed by sasanid propagandists to locate zarathushtra s lifetime roughly around the beginning of iranian domination for a number of reasons connected with complex problems inherent in the iranian chronology there was also a desire on the part of the sasanid propagandists to avoid any millenarian threat in this context zarathushtra whom tradition places early in the ninth millennium after the beginning of the cosmos converted vishtaspa at the age of forty two and vishtaspa s conversion was viewed by some as the beginning of the millennium thus explaining the double date of and years before alexander given the unreliability of the few available sources we are forced to reconstruct an absolute chronology on the basis of other elements principally on the contention that zarathushtra must have lived a few centuries before cyrus the great cambyses and darius as there is no mention in the avesta of the great political achievements that took place in western iran in the middle of the first millennium bce nor is there any mention of the history of that period which was to lead iran to a position of such predominance at the same time for a number of reasons going back much further in history would not be justified consequently the traditionally accepted theory of placing zara thushtra around the beginning of the first millennium bce appears to be the most legitimate as to zarathushtra s land of origin many scholars agree on the basis of valid arguments that he must have come from eastern iran some have held that he was a mede largely because of a late iranian tradition linking zarathushtra with azerbaijan but also because of linguistic reasons based on the language of the avesta this hypothesis however should be discarded as we can suppose both on historical and linguistic grounds that zarathushtra came from the east even though we do not know precisely from which region there is a considerable variety of opinion on this particular matter including the improbable view that he came from chorasmia or present day khorezm or from a wider chorasmian region reaching as far as the oases of merv and herat most likely however zarathushtra s land of origin is somewhere in the vast area stretching from the hindu kush mountain range to the more southern regions of bactria and arachosia modern qandahar as well as drangiana the area of lake helmand it would thus be located in what is now afghanistan or in the border regions of iran zarathushtra himself tells us that he belonged to the priestly caste yasna he was a zaotar cf sanskrit hotr that is a priest belonging to a specific group connected with a school that produced very elaborate and learned religious poetry even in the so called younger avesta he is described as an athravan yashts a more general term encompassing the entire priestly caste to enter it he had undergone a long and rigid training which he used to lend dignity as in the gathas to the contents of his new message the product of a great and original ethical mind zarathushtra also belongs to that venerable priestly tradition linking india to iran in another way by centering his teachings on the praise of the ashavan or possessor of asha that is the one who as in the vedic rtavan seeks truth and masters it thus becoming ashavan in this life almost an initiate and blessed after death any good follower of such teachings seeks the vision of asha just as those chosing the right path in vedic india aspired to the vision of the sun a manifestation of rta behind these concepts and this language lies the great tradition of aryan mysticism that is of indo iranian mysticism zarathushtra s greatness however does not lie in his having belonged to a particular religious tradition rather it lies in the innovation and strength of his message which was in itself a break in the tradition one that force fully and effectively introduced two great revolutionary ideas dualistic monotheism the wise lord who fathers two twin spirits the beneficent and the evil and the expectation of a transfiguration av frashokereti pahl frashgird of life and existence see frashokereti both his monotheistic and dualistic ideas and his particular soteriological doctrine deeply separate zarathushtra s teachings from the indo iranian tradi tions of his upbringing they exemplify his rebellion against a formalistic and ritualistic religion that did not provide adequate answers to the problem of evil because of his basic tenets zarathushtra who advocated an inward religiosity and the right of the individual to resist the imperatives of tradi tion can be numbered among the greatest of religious figures another original facet of zarathushtra s message one that is not easy to understand but which however holds the key to a deeper understanding of the complex intellectual and poetic structure of the gathas is the doctrine of the amesha spentas the beneficent immortals these are spiritualizations of the abstract notions of good thought best truth desirable power bounteous devotion wholeness and immortality all of which operate according to a system of interrelations and correlations and can simultaneously be the manifestations of a divinity and of human virtue see amesha spentas other than the names of his father pourushaspa possessing gray horses and of his mother dughdova one who has milked we know almost nothing of zarathushtra s life a late pahlavi text also give the names of four brothers according to tradition zarathushtra left home at the age of twenty and at thirty he was subject to a revelation both through an intense and powerful inspiration and through a vision only after ten years had passed however did he succeed in converting a cousin of his maidhyoimah to his beliefs he was strongly opposed in his native land by kavis karapans and usijs priestly groups associated with traditional teachings and practices this hostility caused him to leave his region yasna and to seek refuge at the court of kavi vishtaspa a ruler who had been converted to the new religion together with his wife hutaosa when the prophet according to tradition was forty two years old we also know the name of a son isat vastra desiring pastures and of three daughters born of his first wife as well as the names of two more sons urvatatnara commanding men and hvarecithra sun faced born of his second wife hvovi a member of the influential hvogva possessing good cattle family two other figures belonging to the hvogva family are mentioned frashaoshtra and jamaspa the former as hvovi s father and the latter as the husband of the third daughter of the prophet pouruchista very thoughtful whose wedding is celebrated in the fifth hymm in the gathas yasna again according to tradition zarathushtra died at the age of seventy seven he was assassinated by a karapan a priest of the old religion who belonged to the tuirya tribe and was called tur i bradres his name is known only in the pahlavi form the paucity of information on the prophet s life is compensated by a tradi tion rich in legendary detail that arose through the centuries in zoroastrian communities the main texts documenting the tradition are the seventh book of the denkard a pahlavi work dating from the ninth century ce as well as passages from other pahlavi texts and a new persian work from the thirteenth century the zarathusht nama book of zarathushtra written by zaratusht i bahram i pazhdu mythical and ritual elements prevail in the later legends about zarathushtra which idealize him into a symbol and make him the archetype of the perfect man zarathushtra s great popularity in the ancient world continued throughout the renaissance until the enlightenment during the classical and hellenistic periods he was viewed as a wise man a typical representative of an alien wisdom a master of the secrets of heaven and earth a seer astrologer psychologist and wonder worker pythagorean thinkers went so far as to see the influence of zarathushtra on pythagoras himself and the academicians always openly admired the persian thinker who founded the school of the magi and advocated a doctrine of dualism earliest christianity viewed zarathushtra as a precursor of the christian faith one who not only prophesied as had the biblical prophets the advent of the messiah but also predicted the supernatural sign of his coming the star that was to appear in the east and guide the three magi to the manger in bethlehem see magi this christian interpretation is derived from the zoroastrian doctrine of the saoshyant the savior of the future see saoshyant later however religious struggles arose during the sasanid empire in persia third to seventh centuries ce which linked the spread of christianity with the roman empire zarathushtra s popularity in the christian world began to decline the iranian prophet who had been praised often by the gnostic schools and who had been seen by mani as one of the three great messengers from the past was now seen instead as a leader of imposture and heresy a teacher of the diabolic arts of witchery but during the renaiss ance and the enlightenment european cultures reverted to the image of zara thushtra that had come down through classical and hellenistic antiquity he was viewed once again as a great and wise man as the author of the chaldean oracles and probably inventor of qabbalah as a teacher of astrology as a possible bridge between christianity and platonism and at times as in voltaire as a symbol of non christian wisdom after western philology rediscovered zarathushtra during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries friedrich nietzsche in an intentional paradox gave the name zarathustra to the hero of his work also sprach zarathustra nietzsche saw the iranian prophet as the first to have discovered the true motive force underlying all things that is the eternal struggle between good and evil see also zoroastrianism

re laws of god was re a kind and loving god mlee post royalroads ca malcolm lee writes dpw sei cmu edu david wood writes mlee ra royalroads ca malcolm lee writes these laws written for the israelites god s chosen people whom god had expressly set apart from the rest of the world the israelites were a direct witness to god s existence to disobey god after knowing that god is real would be an outright denial of god and therefore immediately punishable remember these laws were written for a different time and applied only to god s chosen people but jesus has changed all of that we are living in the age of grace sin is no longer immediately punishable by death there is repentance and there is salvation through our lord jesus christ and not just for a few chosen people salvation is available to everyone jew and gentile alike sorry if this is late for the thread but i thought god was supposed to be constant and never changing how do you reconcile this common christian view with the paragraph above god never changes sorry but yes he does by your own description he still loves us sending jesus was one of his attempts to reconcile with mankind humorous this notion of an all knowing all powerful god who must attempt to reconcile with his lowly creations i realize that it is not possible to penetrate such logic but is there any chance that you might consider that an omnipotent god need not attempt anything and further that an attempt to reconcile implies a lack of omniscience what you are doing here is projecting human weaknesses onto your god also while we re at it how do you reconcile a kind and loving god with the judeo christian view that sin was at one time immediately punishable by death was killing people for sinning god s way of showing kindness and love sinning in the face of god was punishable by immediate death there are several ot passages to back this up god is god but all humans are sinners thus all pre jesus humans should have been punished with death we aren t punished with sin now of course because god has changed he required a brutal sadistic sacrifice of his own blood in order to allow us to sin without immediate death he cannot tolerate the prescence of sin in his midst yet he does so now he has changed the sadistic murder of his own son has made him more tolerant of our sins besides his midst is everywhere so your statement is meaningless he tolerates sin in hell which surely is in his midst as well also given that he is all knowing he must have eternal knowledge of who will commit which sins as well as when and where so what does tolerance have to do with anything all of this is absolute nonsense unless your god is not indeed all knowing and all powerful or unless he doesn t take the personal interest in everyday affairs that you claim and the israelites knew this and still some of them chose to disobey and were destroyed were these people kind and loving themselves not relevant the claim of kindness and lovingness was made by you in reference to your god the nature of his creations victims is not at issue god gave them every break he could but in the end he really had no choice in the matter i see an all knowing god who did not know what the ultimate outcome would be and an all powerful god who had no choice in the matter mindmush seeing as how we were failing to achieve salvation on our own he sent his son to die for us to be the ultimate sin offering did i miss something did you give some indication at to why a kind and loving god should require sadistic human sacrifice to allow his own botched creations to achieve salvation is the fact the he no longer does this an admission on his part of having made a mistake he sent his son as a consolation to us out of love i note that your answer physically follows my question but i fail to discern a connection between the two by the way for what am i being consoled now that we are living in the age of grace does this mean that for our sins god now damns us to eternal hell after we die rather than killing us immediately if so is this eternal damnation an example of a kind and loving god hey let s be fair for a moment here kind and loving does not mean a free ride why not by the way i note for the record that you didn t answer the questions there is an amount of give and take as in any relationship parents are supposed to be kind and loving but does that mean that children can do whatever they want not part of being a parent means administering punishment when the child is at fault death and or eternal damnation is your idea of correctional punishment i hope you aren t a parent part of being a parent means giving instruction god tests us through the trial of life such that we may grow stronger he teaches what is right and what is wrong this is quite an elaborate fantasy that you ve constructed but sadly it lacks a basis in reality it also does not address the questions that i raised the consequences of our actions are made clear to us be it heaven or be it hell if god did not follow through with what he has warned us about he would not be a very good parent the god that you describe is not a good parent but a tyrant in parenting if a parent issues a warning but does not follow through with it the children will not take that parent s words very seriously god does the same by telling us who have ears to hear what to do and what not to do by life s trials we see the folly of doing our own will rather than his he warns us about the consequences of rejecting him when it comes time for judgement sorry was that the god of the bible whose rules i am to follow or the god of the koran the vedas the book of koresh oh yes it s all so clear do we follow him i will bully for you

good luck i know my shortcomings and i know my strengths and i live my life according to the decisions i make and i am content to abide with the consequences of my decisions as easily as i ll accept the praise for them there have been times in my life when i ve made mistakes yes i try to never make the same mistake twice then you lie to yourself you do not know your shortcomings i have clearly shown one of your shortcomings if not two that is ignorance of the bible and the arrogance you demonstrate butchering it without even knowing its contents i regard christ as a myth because you have been too prideful to examine the record of him for yourself and to demonstate your lack of support for your conclusion i bet you do not even know what the word christ means or which prophet used christ to describe the son of man i feel that there are far too many people offering far too many interpretations of what he supposedly said and did the only person who can really judge me is me yes i agree with that so we must learn first read the bible come up with our own interpretation evaluate what is being said and by whom check the history books as well compare someone else s interpretation with your own then make a judgment but i tell you the truth of what is being said in the bible needs interpretation as much as a coffee cup needs interpretation and remember the bible isn t a guru s esoteric guide to metaphysics it doesn t take a theologian to understand what is being said the bible is a bunch of testimonies from people like you and i addressed to people like you and i these guys wrote down what they saw and heard is it their open diary and they want to tell you something and because they want you to know something they make it very clear what they want you to know they didn t encouch their ideas in esoteric rhetoric but in simple straight forward language i choose the roads i travel and i decide whether or not i want to reach the end of any given road or turn back and as long as i don t always turn back there s no shame in it when i need help i seek out my friends you have chosen the road that avoids the bible you have chosen the road that avoids a confrontation with the living god because that road doesn t look appealing to you you rather build your own road one that goes far away from that confrontation but be assured of this you will have to confront him one day willingly or unwillingly and you don t have a clue about what i m saying either open your eyes and see open your ears and listen i m not just spouting off empty words this is my life this is what gives me meaning i see what you mean i hear what your saying i am not degrading your life but i have heard the same irrational excuses for years there is nothing new in what you are saying and by your own words you are spouting off contradictions if contradictions give you meaning then your life must be sad i say my mother loves me how do i know you ask i can point to definite things she s done for me and i can even just bring her to you so you can ask her face to face you say your deity loves you how do you know i ask bingo for god so loved the world he gave his only begotton to son so that whososever belives in him will have ever lasting life i look what god did he has given his son even to his death so that i can have hope in his resurrection and know that life isn t for nothing but has glorious purpose you can t even convince me that it exists because you turn your eyes away from testimony and history you choose to lie to yourself that he doesn t exist for you ignore what has been said for thousands of years you sound exactly almost verbatim like the lazarus of jesus s story starting in luke and the conclusion of that story is a bleak one lazarus wound up in hell the story ends like this for if lazarus doesn t even listen to moses and the prophets he won t even believe if a man rose from the dead if any god dangles heaven before me like a carrot promising untold pleasures to me if i ll only suspend my disbelief and ignore my rationality for just this once then i would choose hell i can not lie to myself to placate another being no matter how powerful it is arrogance at its best the fact is you are not rational several specific cases have already been cited and again with this new statement you show more irrationality with regards to heaven jesus does tell you something of what to expect in heaven jesus expects you to use your brain to believe in him jesus does not expect you to placate either jesus wants you to willingly come to him but not as his grovelling slave but rather as his brother who will share in his glorious riches why do you not pick up the bible and read it for yourself you maintain you have an open mind see whether you are lying to yourself for yourself why would you want to live a good life to you you die and that s it don t contradict yourself you have no reason to live a good life it doesn t do you any good in the end your life doesn t do anybody else any good either because everyone dies anyway so you have no reason to lead a good life leading a good life is meaningless why do you do such a meaningless thing that paragraph demonstrates that you haven t listened to a single word i ve said i do understand what you said but that s is not what i feel went amiss here you missed the point living a good life has no eternal consequences once they close the amusement park of life to you that is the end to you it is over to you therefore your time spent in the amusement park is meaningless it has no eternal consequences to you nor to anyone left on earth but then you contradict yourself from a previous post you said doing evil things is bad to you it shouldn t matter if you do evil things or good things it is all meaningless in the end anyway so go rob a bank go tell someone you dislike that he is a dirty rotten slime bag what s restraining you life after all has no eternal consequences and accountability is irrelevant in the same way i think life is fun and i don t intend to leave the amusement park of life until they close down for the night d at which time you are truly not the master of yourself i m sorry i don t feel that sacrificing jesus was something any god i d worship would do unless the sacrifice was only temporary in which case it s not really all that important has the resurrection sunk in jesus is alive jesus is not dead so you and your holy book say by the same token therefore santa claus delivers toys every xmas don t you see i have no reason to believe that what you say is true please give me some reason that i can t similarly apply to santa claus you have every reason to believe that what jesus says and the witnesses of jesus say are true but you choose to be unreasonable and ignore the reasons by definition ignorance santa claus is said to live at the north pole and have a squad of elves and flying reindeer ever see a flying reindeer has anyone in human history seen a flying reindeer has anyone seen a reindeer whose nose blinks red on the other hand are people born in bethlehem was nebuchandezzar really a king was daniel really one of his court officials were david and solomon really kings of israel and judah was their really a king called jehoachin did sennecherib really attack jerusalem years before christ did sennacherib really lose his battle and badly was there really a caiaphas who interrogated jesus yes yes yes history verifies it it is nonfiction do you have a problem discerning truth from fiction perhaps you can t evaluate the context of grimm s fairy tales apart from that of the scientific american i suppose you treat both with equal truthfulness or equal falsity is this what you are telling me or is it that just do want to read the scientific american and find out that it s not a fairy tale are you thereby inferring that your deity is nothing more than a collection of verses in a book and cannot be supported without invoking them get real have you ever been to zaire do you have to go there to be assured that there really is such a place given your irrationality i take it you have never used a map in your life why do you believe what you believe given the overwhelming evidence as well as my personal experience with the living god i d be an irrational unreasoning ignorant fool if i didn t follow jesus

re is it good that jesus died brian ceccarelli presents us with the fallacy of false dichotomy in stating that we must accept every thing in the books attributed to peter or we must discount every other book of antiquity peter died two millenia ago the original letters he wrote have long since decayed into dust if he were alive today and i could do you question the existence of alexander the great tilgrath pilisar iii nero caligula josephus cyrus the great artexerxes their documents have decayed to dust too brian why another excuse mr ceccarelli you seem to be stating that we must accept accept everything written in every historical document somehow i doubt do that yourself that thus since i doubt you accept everything written in every historical document i would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith in the words of the books attributed to peter i shall now give an example of a document from antiquity which i am sure you reject it dates from the time of ramses ii this was first presented here by matthew wiener these inscriptions were carved soon after a battle and were carved with the pharoah s specific approval so we have true originals rather than mere copies this account records the the battle of kadesh circa bc which occurred on the river orontes about miles south of aleppo the egyptians won this battle with the hittites and ramses had his victory inscribed all over the place a few of of these inscriptions have survived in near perfect form it is a record of how the pharoah pretty much single handedly defeated the hittites after being separated from his troops note that the egyptian wavers back and forth between first and third person the following is from miriam lichtheim s ancient egyptian literature volume ii my majesty caused the forces of the foes from hitti to fall on their faces one upon the other as crocodiles fall into the water of the orontes i was after them like a griffin i attacked all the countries i alone for my infantry and my chariotry had deserted me not one of them stood looking back as i live as ra loves me as my father atum favors me everything that my majesty has told i did it in truth in the presence of my infantry and my chariotry note this paragraph records not only ramses divine word but also that there were thousands of witnesses to the event now from the heart of battle then his majesty drove at a gallop and charged the forces of the foe from hitti being alone by himself none other with him his majesty proceeded to look about him and found chariots ringing him on his way out no officer was with me no charioteer no soldier of the army no shield bearer my infantry my chariotry yielded before them not one of them stood firm to fight with them his majesty spoke what is this father amun is it right for a father to ignore his son are my deeds a matter for you to ignore do i not walk and stand at your word i have not neglected an order you gave too great is he the great lord of egypt to allow aliens to step on his path what are these asiatics to you o amun the wretches ignorant of god have i not made for you many great monuments i call to you my father amun i am among a host of strangers all countries are arrayed against me i am alone there s none with me the labors of many people are nothing amun is more helpful than they i came here by the command of your mouth o amun i have not transgressed your command now though i prayed in a distant land my voice resounded in southern thebes i found amun came when i called to him he gave me his hand and i rejoiced he called from behind as if near by forward i am with you i your father my hand is with you i prevail over a hundred thousand men i am lord of victory lover of valor i found my heart stout my breast in joy all i did succeeded i was like mont i slaughtered among them at my will not one looked behind him not one turned around whoever fell down did not rise one called out to the other saying no man is he who is among us it is seth great of strength baal in person not deeds of man are these his doings they are of one who is unique who fights a hundred thousand without soldiers and chariots come quick flee before him to seek life and breathe air for he who attempts to get close to him his hands all his limbs grow limp one cannot hold either bow or spears when one sees him come racing along my majesty hunted them like a griffin i slaughtered among them unceasingly so you see brian we have a few original manuscripts recording the miraculous battle between the ramses and the hittites do you reject them as being completely true i suspect you do and if so then do you also in your own words question the existence of alexander the great tilgrath pilisar iii nero caligula josephus cyrus the great artexerxes do you also thereby question all their documents that s the problem with your all or nothing approach many ancient people used to mix a bit of fancy with their facts so for you to say that we must either accept all of peter and the rest of the new testament or accept no records of antiquity at all forces you thereby to accept the verity of documents you probably do not find completely credible as to your other argument that so many people have testified to jesus that he must be true are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from shepherds to irs agents to royal officials to kings to computer programmers fiction with a scoff of your keyboard with near complete ignorance of the testimonies are you going to say that that is all complete hooey would that not be the most audacious display of arrogance do you actually think you know better than king solomon king david or even abraham lincoln i have three points first this is argumentum ad populum ie appeal to popular opinion you cannot vote on truth for instance do the millions of hindu s past and present who testify to the reality of brahma constitute actual evidence for the existence of brahma how would you answer your own question in regards to the testimony of hindus with a scoff of your keyboard with near complete ignorance of the testimonies are you going to say that that is all complete hooey if you do so scoff then how do you objectively justify your own special pleading second it is not at all clear that king solomon or king david testified to jesus you can claim it to be clear but that does not make it true third it is quite arguable that abraham lincoln was not christian and that he had both a public and a private view of christianity in fact there was much discussion about it in his day yes he was publically accused of being a deist oh my i am presently collecting a faq for lincoln as i ve previously done for tyre jefferson and etc later dave butler my earlier views of the unsoundness of the christian scheme of salvation and the human origin of the scriptures have become clearer and stronger with advancing years and i see no reason for thinking i shall ever change them abraham lincoln to judge j s wakefield after the death of willie lincoln

larsonian astronomy physics creation the following partial summary of a theory of the universe includes a little known description of the creation of our solar system larsonian astronomy and physics orthodox physicists astronomers and astrophysicists claim to be looking for a unified field theory in which all of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single set of laws or equations but they have been systematically ignoring or suppressing an excellent one for years the late physicist dewey b larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe which he calls the reciprocal system is built on two fundamental postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of space and time the physical universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and in two reciprocal forms space and time the physical universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is euclidean from these two postulates larson developed a complete theoretical universe using various combinations of translational vibrational rotational and vibrational rotational motions the concepts of in ward and out ward scalar motions and speeds in relation to the speed of light which larson called unit velocity and the natural datum at each step in the development larson was able to match objects in his theoretical universe with objects in the real physical universe photons sub atomic particles incomplete atoms charges atoms molecules globular star clusters galaxies binary star systems solar systems white dwarf stars pulsars quasars etc even objects not yet discovered then such as exploding galaxies and gamma ray bursts and applying his theory to his new model of the atom larson was able to precisely and accurately calculate inter atomic distances in crystals and molecules compressibility and thermal expansion of solids and other properties of matter all of this is described in good detail with out fancy complex mathematics in his books books of dewey b larson the following is a complete list of the late physicist dewey b larson s books about his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe some of the early books are out of print now but still available through inter library loan the structure of the physical universe the case against the nuclear atom beyond newton new light on space and time quasars and pulsars nothing but motion a substitute for the billion super collider the last four chapters explain chemical bonding the neglected facts of science the universe of motion final solutions to most all astrophysical mysteries basic properties of matter all but the last of these books were published by north pacific publishers p o box portland or and should be available via inter library loan if your local university or public library doesn t have each of them several of them including the last one are available from the international society of unified science isus e atkin ave salt lake city utah this is the organization that was started to promote larson s theory they have other related publications including the quarterly journal reciprocity physicist dewey b larson s background physicist dewey b larson was a retired engineer chemical or electrical he was about years old when he died in may he had a bachelor of science degree in engineering science from oregon state university he developed his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe while trying to develop a way to compute chemical properties based only on the elements used larson s lack of a fancy ph d degree might be one reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him but it is not a valid reason sometimes it takes a relative outsider to clearly see the forest through the trees at the same time it is clear from his books that he also knew orthodox physics and astronomy as well as any physicist or astronomer well enough to point out all their contradictions ad hoc assumptions principles of impotence in consistencies etc larson did not have the funds etc to experimentally test his theory and it was not necessary for him to do so he simply compared the various parts of his theory with other researchers experimental and observational data and in many cases his explanation fit better a self consistent theory is much more than the orthodox physicists and astronomers have they claim to be looking for a unified field theory that works but have been ignoring one for over years now modern physics does not explain the physical universe so well some parts of some of larson s books are full of quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who agree and remember that epicycles crystal spheres geocentricity flat earth theory etc also once seemed to explain it well but were later proved conceptually wrong prof frank h meyer professor emeritus of uw superior was is a strong proponent of larson s theory and was or still is president of larson s organization the international society of unified science and editor of their quarterly journal reciprocity he moved to minneapolis after retiring super collider boondoggle i am against contruction of the superconducting super collider in texas or anywhere else it would be a gross waste of money and contribute almost nothing of scientific value most physicists don t realize it but according to the comprehensive general unified theory of the late physicist dewey b larson as described in his books the strange goofy particles mesons hyperons alleged quarks etc which they are finding in existing colliders fermi lab cern etc are really just atoms of anti matter which are created by the high energy colliding beams and which quickly disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible with their environment a larger and more expensive collider will only create a few more elements of anti matter that the physicists have not seen there before and the physicists will be even more confused than they are now are a few more types of anti matter atoms worth the billion cost don t we have much more important uses for this wasted money another thing to consider is that the primary proposed location in texas has a serious and growing problem with some kind of fire ants eating the insulation off underground cables how much poisoning of the ground and ground water with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of the supercollider naming the super collider after ronald reagon as proposed is totally absurd if it is built it should be named after a leading particle physicist larsonian anti matter in larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe anti matter is not a simple case of opposite charges of the same types of particles it has more to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the photons of which they are made in relation to the vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light which larson calls unit velocity and the natural datum in larson s theory a positron is actually a particle of matter not anti matter when a positron and electron meet the rotational vibrations charges and rotations of their respective photons of which they are made neutralize each other in larson s theory the anti matter half of the physical universe has three dimensions of time and only one dimension of space and exists in a reciprocal relationship to our material half larsonian relativity the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet mercury has been observed and precisely measured to advance at the rate of seconds of arc per century seconds of this advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational perturbations from the other planets venus earth jupiter etc the remaining seconds of arc are being used to help prove einstein s general theory of relativity but the late physicist dewey b larson achieved results closer to the seconds than general relativity can by instead using special relativity in one or more of his books he applied the lorentz transformation on the high orbital speed of mercury larson totally rejected general relativity as another mathematical fantasy he also rejected most of special relativity including the parts about mass increases near the speed of light and the use of the lorentz transform on doppler shifts those quasars with red shifts greater than really are moving faster than the speed of light although most of that motion is away from us in time in larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe there are three dimensions of time instead of only one but two of those dimensions can not be measured from our material half of the physical universe the one dimension that we can measure is the clock time at low relative speeds the values of the other two dimensions are negligible but at high speeds they become significant and the lorentz transformation must be used as a fudge factor larson often used the term coordinate time when writing about this in regard to mass increases it has been proven in atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near the speed of light but the formula for acceleration is acceleration force mass a f m orthodox physicists are ignoring the third factor force in larson s theory mass stays constant and force drops toward zero force is actually a motion or combinations of motions or relations between motions including inward and outward scalar motions the expansion of the universe for example is an outward scalar motion inherent in the universe and not a result of the so called big bang which is yet another mathematical fantasy the universe of motion i wish to recommend to everyone the book the universe of motion by dewey b larson north pacific publishers p o box portland oregon pages indexed hardcover it contains the astrophysical portions of a general unified theory of the physical universe developed by that author an unrecognized genius more than thirty years ago it contains final solutions to most all astrophysical mysteries including the formation of galaxies binary and multiple star systems and solar systems the true origin of the degree background radiation cosmic rays and gamma ray bursts and the true nature of quasars pulsars white dwarfs exploding galaxies etc it contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are all looking for if they are ready to seriously consider it with open minds the following is an example of his theory s success in his first book in the structure of the physical universe larson predicted the existence of exploding galaxies several years before astronomers started finding them they are a necessary consequence of larson s comprehensive theory and when quasars were discovered he had an immediate related explanation for them also gamma ray bursts astro physicists and astronomers are still scratching their heads about the mysterious gamma ray bursts they were originally thought to originate from neutron stars in the disc of our galaxy but the new gamma ray telescope now in earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions uniformly and their source locations in space do not correspond to any known objects except for a few cases of directional coincidence gamma ray bursts are a necessary consequence of the general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b larson according to page of his book the universe of motion published in the gamma ray bursts are coming from supernova explosions in the anti matter half of the physical universe which larson calls the cosmic sector because of the relationship between the anti matter and material halves of the physical universe and the way they are connected together the gamma ray bursts can pop into our material half anywhere in space seemingly at random this is why the source locations of the bursts do not correspond with known objects and come from all directions uniformly i wonder how close to us in space a source location would have to be for a gamma ray burst to kill all or most life on earth there would be no way to predict one nor to stop it perhaps some of the mass extinctions of the past which are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids were actually caused by nearby gamma ray bursts larsonian binary star formation about half of all the stars in the galaxy in the vicinity of the sun are binary or double but orthodox astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory theory about how they form or why there are so many of them but binary star systems are actually a likely consequence of the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b larson i will try to summarize larsons explanation which is detailed in chapter of his book the universe of motion and in some of his other books first of all according to larson stars do not generate energy by fusion a small fraction comes from slow gravitational collapse the rest results from the complete annihilation of heavy elements heavier than iron each element has a destructive temperature limit the heavier the element is the lower is this limit a star s internal temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays gradually reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and lighter elements when the internal temperature of the star reaches the destructive temperature limit of iron there is a type i supernova explosion this is because there is so much iron present and that is related to the structure of iron atoms and the atom building process which larson explains in some of his books better than i can when the star explodes the lighter material on the outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less than the speed of light the heavier material in the center portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to the speed of light because of the high temperature the explosion pushes that material over the speed of light and it expands outward in time which is equivalent to inward in space and it often actually disappears for a while over long periods of time both masses start to fall back gravitationally the material that had been blown outward in space now starts to form a red giant star the material that had been blown outward in time starts to form a white dwarf star both stars then start moving back toward the main sequence from opposite directions on the h r diagram the chances of the two masses falling back into the exact same location in space making a single lone star again are near zero they will instead form a binary system orbiting each other according to larson a white dwarf star has an inverse density gradient is densest at its surface because the material at its center is most widely dispersed blown outward in time this eliminates the need to resort to mathematical fantasies about degenerate matter neutron stars black holes etc larsonian solar system formation if the mass of the heavy material at the center of the exploding star is relatively small then instead of a single white dwarf star there will be several mini white dwarf stars revolving around the red giant star but probably still too far away in three dimensional time to be affected by its heat etc these will become planets in chapter of the universe of motion larson used all this information and other principles of his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe to derive his own version of bode s law black hole fantasy i heard that physicist stephen w hawking recently completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of two black holes merging together into a single black hole and concluded that the new black hole would have more mass than the sum of the two original black holes such a result should be recognized by everyone as a red flag causing widespread doubt about the whole idea of black holes etc after reading physicist dewey b larson s books about his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe especially his book the universe of motion it is clear to me that black holes are nothing more than mathematical fantasies the strange object at cygnus x is just an unusually massive white dwarf star not the black hole that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want to prove their theory by the way i do not understand why so much publicity is being given to physicist stephen hawking the physicists and astronomers seem to be acting as if hawking s severe physical problem somehow makes him wiser it does not i wish the same attention had been given to physicist dewey b larson while he was still alive widespread publicity and attention should now be given to larson s theory books and organization the international society of unified science electro magnetic propulsion i heard of that concept many years ago in connection with ufo s and unorthodox inventors but i never was able to find out how or why they work or how they are constructed i found a possible clue about why they might work on pages of the book basic properties of matter by the late physicist dewey b larson which describes part of larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe i quote one paragraph as indicated in the preceding chapter the development of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally different concept of the nature of electrical resistance the electrons we find are derived from the environment it was brought out in volume i larson s book nothing but motion that there are physical processes in operation which produce electrons in substantial quantities and that although the motions that constitute these electrons are in many cases absorbed by atomic structures the opportunities for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are limited it follows that there is always a large excess of free electrons in the material sector material half of the universe most of which are uncharged in this uncharged state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension space because they are inherently rotating units of space and the relation of space to space is not motion in open space therefore each uncharged electron remains permanently in the same location with respect to the natural reference system in the manner of a photon in the context of the stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron like the photon is carried outward at the speed of light by the progression of the natural reference system all material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation meanwhile there are other processes to be discussed later whereby electrons are returned to the environment the electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level note that in larson s theory uncharged electrons are also massless and are basically photons of light of a particular frequency above the unit frequency spinning around one axis at a particular rate below the unit rate unit velocity is the speed of light and there are vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light according to larson s theory i might have the above and below labels mixed up larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass less un charged electrons flying around at the speed of light if this is true then the electro magnetic propulsion fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these electrons or other particles in space perhaps giving them a charge and mass and shooting them toward the rear to achieve propulsion in larson s theory an electrical charge is a one dimensional rotational vibration of a particular frequency above the unit frequency superimposed on the rotation of the particle the paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is generated in clouds suppression of larsonian physics the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b larson has been available for more than years published in in his first book the structure of the physical universe it is totally un scientific for hawking wheeler sagan and the other sacred priests of the religion they call science or physics or astronomy etc as well as the scientific literature and the education systems to totally ignore larson s theory has they have larson s theory has excellent explanations for many things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers such as gamma ray bursts and the nature of quasars larson s theory deserves to be honestly and openly discussed in the physics chemistry and astronomy journals in the u s and elsewhere and at least the basic principles of larson s theory should be included in all related courses at uw ec uw madison cambridge cornell university and elsewhere so that students are not kept in the dark about a worthy alternative to the

re rw is robert weiss the only orthodox christian i m curious to know if christians ever read books based on critique on the religion classical text such as age of reason by paine or the myth maker by jacobi sometimes it is good to know your enemy and if you want to do serious research you have to understand both sides and not solely the one and only right one yes one does i examined a critique of the book of romans by i think benjamin franklin once a deist i found it amazing that benjamin franklin missed the whole boat i also have the writings on thomas jefferson sitting on my shelf and it is amazing how much he missed i have studied plato s theory of forms and aristotelian hylomorphesism what a pile of junk jesus makes plato and aristotle look like kindergardeners psychology the id ego superego by freud elements of truth but jesus explained it far better and gave reasons thomas paine benjamin franklin thomas jefferson are mere men they can screw up the bible just as well as any man i do not put these men on a pedestal and if i remember t j s autobiography correctly he thought thomas paine was the most unread man he ever met here s some more circular reasoning to you paul says to the corinthians that that the gospel will be foolishness to the world because it is spiritually discerned and so people without the spirit of god haven t a clue to what the bible is saying from your point of view that s incredibly circular and convenient to me it is mysteriously and supernaturally bizarre i can see it but you can t this is not arrogance on my part trust me it is as bizarre to you as it is to me but nonetheless it is a truth explainable or not are any of you color blind to red and green i am remember those dot tests they do at the optomologist s they put pictures in front of you and you are supposed to identify the pattern in the dots if your eyes are perfectly normal you can see letters or numerals embedded in the dots they are a slightly different color and stand out from the background but if you are color blind to red and green you will not see anything but gray shaded dots that is how a dot test appears to me i do not see a pattern at all a normal seeing person will see the patterns and to him i seem like a total anomaly to him i appear as if i am missing the universe or something it is hard for him to understand why i can t see anything that to him is as plain as day that it what it is like with the bible the word of god to the believer the believer can see the meaning in the words i can see how the patterns fit together there is such depth such consistency but then on the other hand i notice the non believer he doesn t see it he thinks i am weird because he thinks i am seeing things i look at him and say no you are weird you do not see then it is time for a sanity check i go to another christian and say do you see this and they go yes it is an x and i say thank god i see the x too it is truly the strangest thing it adds a little extra dimension to the phrase he will make the blind see and the deaf hear i am glad that jesus has enabled me to see i wish every non believer could see what they are missing

re rw is robert weiss the only orthodox christian in article c vgyd h s acsu buffalo edu psyrobtw ubvmsd cc buffalo edu robert weiss writes in article librba byuvm bitnet librba byuvm bitnet writes rick anderson writes ra robert you keep making references to orthodox belief and saying ra things like it is held that cf kermit thread on what ra exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call orthodox orthodox is a compound word it comes from orthos straight true right and from doxa opinion doctrine teaching i use orthodox to refer to right teaching as opposed to universal or catholic or foursquare gosple i think that the greek orthodox church would take high offense at your misuse of the word your version of christianity is neither mainstream nor bible derived you make claims of bible centricity that are not derivable soley from the bible about six seven months ago you claimed that your primary objection to the lds was that our doctrine was not bible derived and now this and other claims can be shown are also not bible interpeting bible right teaching is derived from letting god speak to us through the bible this can be from reading simple truths in the scriptures and by using the bible to interpret the bible simple truths oh for example ra who is that holds that luke meant what you said he meant i think that it is apparent from reading the scriptures that are pertinent luke records christ s promise to the repentant thief who hung on an adjacent cross truly i say to you today you will be with me in paradise but was it not until later that christ rose from the dead and ascended to heaven if christ himself was not in heaven until sunday how could the repentant thief have been there with him the answer lies in the location of paradise when jesus died apparently paradise was not exalted to heaven until easter day paradise exalted to heaven paradise wasn t equal to heaven and now it is yet you claim that peeple can not be exalted to heaven nicht wahr jesus refers to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and lazarus as abraham s bosom to which the godly beggar lazarus was carried by the angels after his decease luke thus abraham s bosom referred to the place where the souls of the redeemed waited till the day of christ s resurrection when i read the story i found that abraham s bosom wasn t so much a place but somewhere the rich man could see and talk to abraham it was not yet lifted to heaven but it may well have been a section of hades hebrew sheol reserved for believers who had died in the faith but would not be admitted into the glorious presence of god in heaven until the price of redemption had actually been paid on calvary or even that none would precede the presence of jesus back to glory with the father gee this is fairly close to what the lds call spirit prison and what you have called false doctrine doubtless it was the infernal paradise that the souls of jesus and the repentant thief repaired after they each died on friday afternoon but on sunday after the risen christ had first appeared to mary magdalene john and her two companions matthew presumably he then took up with him to glory all the inhabitants of infernal paradise including abraham lazarus and the repentant thief we read in ephesians concerning christ ascending on high he led captivity captive he gave gifts unto men vers deleted reproduced below quoted from the sunspot gopher archive presumably he led the whole band of liberated captives from hades i e the whole population of preresurrection paradise up to the glory of heaven this part is not supported from scripture nor does it support your claim that the paradise where christ descended was exalted making such claims on this little evidence ignores the witness of the scripture sun ephas sun wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity sun captive and gave gifts unto men sun sun x ref psalms sun thou has ascended on hight thout hast led captivity captive thou has sun recieved gifts for men yea for the rebellious aslo that the lord god sun might dwell amoung them sun sun ephas sun now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first sun into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same sun also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all sun things and he gave some apostles and some prophets and sun some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the sun perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the sun edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of sun the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man sun unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ that we sun henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about sun with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning sun craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the sun truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head using this to argue that paradise or spirit prison is now changed from a pre easter postion to post easter by god postion is not supportable makeing such a claim requires more evidence than you have given here ra whenever your personal interpretation of biblical passages is ra challenged your only response seems to be that one needs merely to ra look at the bible in order to see the truth but what of those who ra see biblical things differently from you i think that this characterization is faulty whenever my personal interpretation is questioned i usually give a reason yes and your reasons are in general not supported by any direct reading of the scriptures you have demonstrated that you claims to scriptural proof need to be cross checked the referencs that you supply often do not support your postion if they are read in the context of the scripture as for those that see things differently please put forward where there is a valid difference and we can discuss it i seem to be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one views the bible is somehow legitimate except or course for the stuff that i glean from it put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can have a discussion on that topic but to decry something that i put forward without putting forward something else to discuss and to dismiss what i put forward while giving credence to other alleged views that have yet to be put forward is simply being contentious how about that those who have been in paradise and have accepted the gosple will be judged of jesus christ and then return to the presence of god is that somehow different from your expressed view that the paradise spoken of or abraham s bosom ra are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really ra understands it if you believe that something that i have drawn from scripture is wrong then please show me from scripture where it is wrong simply stating that there are other views is not a proof

hell in the king james version of the bible there are three differents words translated into the word hell these greek words have totally different meanings the words are hades tartaros and gehenna in bibical usage the greek word hades is used only times in the new testament and is roughly the equivalent to the old testament word sheol meaning the grave or pit compare acts with psalms hades may be likened to a hole in the ground in the bible it has nothing to do with fire most modern bibical translators admit that the use in the english word hell to translate hades and sheol are an unfortunate and misleading practice why because when seeing the word hell many readers impute to it the traditional connotation of an ever burning inferno when this was never remotely intended in the greek language or in old english in its true bibical usage hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of the dead but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of shadowy realm hades is simply the abode we call the grave all dead go to this hell the second hell of the bible tartaros is mentioned only once in scripture pet for if god spared not the angels that sinned but cast them down to hell tartaros and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment following their rebellion to unseat god from his throne isa rev the archangel lucifer now satan and a third of the created angels now demons were ejected from heaven luke they were cast down to tartaros a place or condition of restraint that god has imposed on the mutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment jude cor tartaros then is a hell that applies only to evil rebellious angels or demons it is interesting that the ancient greeks used this word to describe the place in which zeus confined the rebellious titans nowhere in the bible is there any mention of men being put into this particular hell the the third word that is translated as hell in the bible is gehenna it comes from the hebrew gai hinnom meaning valley of hinniom hinnom is a deep narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of jerusalem in old testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites including infant sacrifice it was there that the apostate kings ahaz and manasseh made their children pass through the fire to the god molech the rites were specifically celebrated in tophet the place of abhorrence one of the chief groves in the valley king josiah of ancient judah finally put an end to these abominations he defiled the valley rendering it ceremonially unclean kings later the valley became the cesspool and city dump of jerusalem a repository for sewage refuse and animal carcasses the bodies of dispised criminals were also burned there along with the rubbish fires burned continuously feeding by a constant supply of garbage and refuse aceldama the field of blood purchased with the money judas received for the betrayal of christ matt was also in part of the valley of hinnom so what does this valley called gehenna have to do with hell in rev the satan inspired political dictator and a miracle working religious figure the false prophet working with him will resist the re establishment of the government of god by jesus christ at his second coming their fate is revealed by the apostle john and the beast was taken and with him the false prophet these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone where will this temporary lake of fire this hell be the prophet isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the beast for tophet in the valley of hinnom is ordained of old yea for the king it is prepared he hath made it deep and large the pile thereof is fire and wood the breath of the lord like a stream of brimstone doth kindle it isa one thousand years later satan himself will be cast into this rekindled fiery lake where the beast and false prophet were cast rev but what of the wicked who have died over the millennia does the bible say that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of fire in the sequence of rev the incorrigibly wicked are resurrected to be thrown into the lake of fire after satan is cast there rev what will become of these wicked will they writhe in flames for eternity the wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming gehenna fire on the earth they wil be consumed annihilated destroyed this punishment will be everlasting permanent and final the bible calls it the second death rev from which there is no possibility of a further resurrection the bible does teach eternal punishment but not eternal punishing the prophet malachi provides a graphic description for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up to the righteous god says that the wicked shall be ashes under the soles of your feet mal gehenna was a place of destruction and death not a place of living torture jesus was talking to jews who understood all about this gehenna or valley of hinnom utter destruction by fire was complete nothing was left but ashes every text in the bible translated from this greek word gehenna means complete destruction not living torture not eternal life in torment the bible says in romans the wages of sin is death not eternal life in torture the punishment revealed in the bible is death the cessation of life eternal life is the gift of god

re what right joakimr ifi uio no joakim ruud writes recently i ve asked myself a rather interesting question what right does god have on our lives always assuming there is a god of course in his infinite wisdom he made it perfectly clear that if we don t live according to his rules we will burn in hell well with what right can god make that desicion let s say for the sake of argument that god creates every one of us directly or indirectly it doesn t matter what then happens is that he first creates us and then turns us lose well i didn t ask to be created i guess i ought not conclude from this then that since you didn t ask to be created you don t care if you go to hell let s make an analogue if a scientist creates a unique living creature which has happened it was even patented does he then have the right to expect it to behave in a certain matter or die who is god to impose its rules on us who can tell if god is really so righteous as god likes us to believe are all christians a flock of sheep unable to do otherwise that follow the rest i don t consider myself an unthinking sheep the bible says god created us to be in communion and obedience to him the first and only rule was to not eat of a certain tree or else the punishment is distance from him and physical death god s intention in creating us is to have a relationship with us the bible documents god s attempts to have that relationship culminating in the person of jesus to bear the consequences of all sin so that all who accept him can have a relationship with god again the purpose of creation who is god to impose rules on us he s god and he created us i suppose he has a right based on who he is above you mention in his infinite wisdom and that s what i d say god exemplifies but if you were being sarcastic up there then this whole discussion is irrelevant eh and if we believe god is infinitely wise that belief should inform our relationship with him

alt atheism faq introduction to atheism archive name atheism introduction alt atheism archive name introduction last modified april version begin pgp signed message an introduction to atheism by mathew mathew mantis co uk this article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism whilst i have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues you should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint i would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions some relevant books are listed in a companion article to provide a sense of cohesion and progression i have presented this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist all the questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped up repeatedly on alt atheism since the newsgroup was created some other frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions posed from a christian viewpoint this is because the faq files reflect questions which have actually been asked and it is predominantly christians who proselytize on alt atheism so when i talk of religion i am talking primarily about religions such as christianity judaism and islam which involve some sort of superhuman divine being much of the discussion will apply to other religions but some of it may not what is atheism atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of god some atheists go further and believe that god does not exist the former is often referred to as the weak atheist position and the latter as strong atheism it is important to note the difference between these two positions weak atheism is simple scepticism disbelief in the existence of god strong atheism is a positive belief that god does not exist please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are strong atheists some atheists believe in the non existence of all gods others limit their atheism to specific gods such as the christian god rather than making flat out denials but isn t disbelieving in god the same thing as believing he doesn t exist definitely not disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe it to be true not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is false one may simply have no idea whether it is true or not which brings us to agnosticism what is agnosticism then the term agnosticism was coined by professor huxley at a meeting of the metaphysical society in he defined an agnostic as someone who disclaimed strong atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things must be some cause unknown and unknowable thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for sure whether god exists words are slippery things and language is inexact beware of assuming that you can work out someone s philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic for example many people use agnosticism to mean weak atheism and use the word atheism only when referring to strong atheism beware also that because the word atheist has so many shades of meaning it is very difficult to generalize about atheists about all you can say for sure is that atheists don t believe in god for example it certainly isn t the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out about the universe so what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism there are many philosophical justifications for atheism to find out why a particular person chooses to be an atheist it s best to ask her many atheists feel that the idea of god as presented by the major religions is essentially self contradictory and that it is logically impossible that such a god could exist others are atheists through scepticism because they see no evidence that god exists but isn t it impossible to prove the non existence of something there are many counter examples to such a statement for example it is quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than all other prime numbers of course this deals with well defined objects obeying well defined rules whether gods or universes are similarly well defined is a matter for debate however assuming for the moment that the existence of a god is not provably impossible there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non existence of god if we assume that something does not exist it is always possible to show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter example if on the other hand we assume that something does exist and if the thing in question is not provably impossible showing that the assumption is invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing might be found to show that it isn t there such an exhaustive search is often impractical or impossible there is no such problem with largest primes because we can prove that they don t exist therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist unless we have evidence that they do even theists follow this rule most of the time they don t believe in unicorns even though they can t conclusively prove that no unicorns exist anywhere to assume that god exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be tested we cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere god might be to prove that he doesn t exist anywhere so the sceptical atheist assumes by default that god does not exist since that is an assumption we can test those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of god exists instead they generally restrict their claims so as to cover varieties of god described by followers of various religions so whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no god exists it may be possible to prove that say a god as described by a particular religious book does not exist it may even be possible to prove that no god described by any present day religion exists in practice believing that no god described by any religion exists is very close to believing that no god exists however it is sufficiently different that counter arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of god are not really applicable but what if god is essentially non detectable if god interacts with our universe in any way the effects of his interaction must be measurable hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable if god is essentially non detectable it must therefore be the case that he does not interact with our universe in any way many atheists would argue that if god does not interact with our universe at all it is of no importance whether he exists or not if the bible is to be believed god was easily detectable by the israelites surely he should still be detectable today note that i am not demanding that god interact in a scientifically verifiable physical way it must surely be possible to perceive some effect caused by his presence though otherwise how can i distinguish him from all the other things that don t exist ok you may think there s a philosophical justification for atheism but isn t it still a religious belief one of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is the redefinition game the cynical view of this game is as follows person a begins by making a contentious statement when person b points out that it can t be true person a gradually re defines the words he used in the statement until he arrives at something person b is prepared to accept he then records the statement along with the fact that person b has agreed to it and continues eventually a uses the statement as an agreed fact but uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure redefinitions originally needed to get b to agree to it rather than be seen to be apparently inconsistent b will tend to play along the point of this digression is that the answer to the question isn t atheism a religious belief depends crucially upon what is meant by religious religion is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman controlling power especially in some sort of god and by faith and worship it s worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of buddhism are not religion according to such a definition atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power nor is it categorized by worship in any meaningful sense widening the definition of religious to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as religious as well such as science politics and watching tv ok so it s not a religion but surely belief in atheism or science is still just an act of faith like religion is firstly it s not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one actually believes in secondly it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience most atheists try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible and even those are subject to questioning if experience throws them into doubt science has a number of core assumptions for example it is generally assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers these are the sort of core assumptions atheists make if such basic ideas are called acts of faith then almost everything we know must be said to be based on acts of faith and the term loses its meaning faith is more often used to refer to complete certain belief in something according to such a definition atheism and science are certainly not acts of faith of course individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as religious followers when claiming that something is certain this is not a general tendency however there are many atheists who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exists faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof sceptical atheism certainly doesn t fit that definition as sceptical atheism has no beliefs strong atheism is closer but still doesn t really match as even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data or the lack of it when asserting that god does not exist if atheism is not religious surely it s anti religious it is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either for or against friend or enemy the truth is not so clear cut atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism in that sense it can be said to be anti religion however when religious believers speak of atheists being anti religious they usually mean that the atheists have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists this categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum most atheists take a live and let live attitude unless questioned they will not usually mention their atheism except perhaps to close friends of course this may be in part because atheism is not socially acceptable in many countries a few atheists are quite anti religious and may even try to convert others when possible historically such anti religious atheists have made little impact on society outside the eastern bloc countries to digress slightly the soviet union was originally dedicated to separation of church and state just like the usa soviet citizens were legally free to worship as they wished the institution of state atheism came about when stalin took control of the soviet union and tried to destroy the churches in order to gain complete power over the population some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs but only where they see religion encroaching on matters which are not its business for example the government of the usa such individuals are usually concerned that church and state should remain separate but if you don t allow religion to have a say in the running of the state surely that s the same as state atheism the principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall not legislate concerning matters of religious belief in particular it means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of another but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in nature religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters for example religious believers have historically been responsible for encouraging many political reforms even today many organizations campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as religious campaigns so long as they campaign concerning secular matters and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds most atheists are quite happy to see them have their say what about prayer in schools if there s no god why do you care if people pray because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers and tend to do things that those who don t pray can t just ignore also christian prayer in schools is intimidating to non christians even if they are told that they need not join in the diversity of religious and non religious belief means that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event also non prayers tend to have friends and family who pray it is reasonable to care about friends and family wasting their time even without other motives you mentioned christians who campaign for increased foreign aid what about atheists why aren t there any atheist charities or hospitals don t atheists object to the religious charities there are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can contribute to some atheists contribute to religious charities as well for the sake of the practical good they do some atheists even do voluntary work for charities founded on a theistic basis most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn t worth shouting about in connection with charity to them atheism is just a simple obvious everyday matter and so is charity many feel that it s somewhat cheap not to say self righteous to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set of religious beliefs to weak atheists building a hospital to say i do not believe in god is a rather strange idea it s rather like holding a party to say today is not my birthday why the fuss atheism is rarely evangelical you said atheism isn t anti religious but is it perhaps a backlash against one s upbringing a way of rebelling perhaps it is for some but many people have parents who do not attempt to force any religious or atheist ideas upon them and many of those people choose to call themselves atheists it s also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a backlash against an atheist upbringing as a way of being different on the other hand many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the expectations of others on the whole we can t conclude much about whether atheism or religion are backlash or conformism although in general people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently how do atheists differ from religious people they don t believe in god that s all there is to it atheists may listen to heavy metal backwards even or they may prefer a verdi requiem even if they know the words they may wear hawaiian shirts they may dress all in black they may even wear orange robes many buddhists lack a belief in any sort of god some atheists even carry a copy of the bible around for arguing against of course whoever you are the chances are you have met several atheists without realising it atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance unexceptional but aren t atheists less moral than religious people that depends if you define morality as obedience to god then of course atheists are less moral as they don t obey any god but usually when one talks of morality one talks of what is acceptable right and unacceptable wrong behaviour within society humans are social animals and to be maximally successful they must co operate with each other this is a good enough reason to discourage most atheists from anti social or immoral behaviour purely for the purposes of self preservation many atheists behave in a moral or compassionate way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans so why do they care what happens to others they don t know they simply are that way naturally there are some people who behave immorally and try to use atheism to justify their actions however there are equally many people who behave immorally and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their actions for example here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance jesus christ came into the world to save sinners but for that very reason i was shown mercy so that in me jesus christ might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life now to the king eternal immortal invisible the only god be honor and glory forever and ever the above quote is from a statement made to the court on february th by jeffrey dahmer the notorious cannibal serial killer of milwaukee wisconsin it seems that for every atheist mass murderer there is a religious mass murderer but what of more trivial morality a survey conducted by the roper organization found that behavior deteriorated after born again experiences while only of respondents said they had driven intoxicated before being born again had done so after conversion similarly had used illegal drugs before conversion after two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex before salvation after freethought today september p so it seems that at best religion does not have a monopoly on moral behaviour is there such a thing as atheist morality if you mean is there such a thing as morality for atheists then the answer is yes as explained above many atheists have ideas about morality which are at least as strong as those held by religious people if you mean does atheism have a characteristic moral code then the answer is no atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person will behave most atheists follow many of the same moral rules as theists but for different reasons atheists view morality as something created by humans according to the way humans feel the world ought to work rather than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being then aren t atheists just theists who are denying god a study by the freedom from religion foundation found that over of the atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for them they had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible with what they observed around them atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial they are unbelievers through choice the vast majority of them have spent time studying one or more religions sometimes in very great depth they have made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs this decision may of course be an inevitable consequence of that individual s personality for a naturally sceptical person the choice of atheism is often the only one that makes sense and hence the only choice that person can honestly make but don t atheists want to believe in god atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them many of them have no desire to be watched over no matter how good natured the big brother figure might be some atheists would like to be able to believe in god but so what should one believe things merely because one wants them to be true the risks of such an approach should be obvious atheists often decide that wanting to believe something is not enough there must be evidence for the belief but of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of god they are unwilling in their souls to see many if not most atheists were previously religious as has been explained above the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that god exists many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach god of course it is true that some atheists lack an open mind but assuming that all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed minded comments such as of course god is there you just aren t looking properly are likely to be viewed as patronizing certainly if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are being sincere if they say that they have searched for god if you are not willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth debate is futile isn t the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist many atheists live a purposeful life they decide what they think gives meaning to life and they pursue those goals they try to make their lives count not by wishing for eternal life but by having an influence on other people who will live on for example an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform in the hope of leaving his mark on history it is a natural human tendency to look for meaning or purpose in random events however it is by no means obvious that life is the sort of thing that has a meaning to put it another way not everything which looks like a question is actually a sensible thing to ask some atheists believe that asking what is the meaning of life is as silly as asking what is the meaning of a cup of coffee they believe that life has no purpose or meaning it just is so how do atheists find comfort in time of danger there are many ways of obtaining comfort from family friends or even pets or on a less spiritual level from food or drink or tv that may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger but so what should individuals believe in things because they are comforting or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be in the end it s a decision for the individual concerned most atheists are unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it makes them feel comfortable they put truth before comfort and consider that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy that s just hard luck don t atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong the short answer is no do you many atheists have been atheists for years they have encountered many arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of god but they have found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive thousands of years of religious belief haven t resulted in any good proof of the existence of god atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely to be proved wrong in the immediate future and they stop worrying about it so why should theists question their beliefs don t the same arguments apply no because the beliefs being questioned are not similar weak atheism is the sceptical default position to take it asserts nothing strong atheism is a negative belief theism is a very strong positive belief atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs because of the very real harm they can cause not just to the believers but to everyone else what sort of harm religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind it s not just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings think of all the time and effort spent building churches praying and so on imagine how that effort could be better spent many theists believe in miracle healing there have been plenty of instances of ill people being healed by a priest ceasing to take the medicines prescribed to them by doctors and dying as a result some theists have died because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds it is arguable that the catholic church s opposition to birth control and condoms in particular is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many third world countries and contributing to the spread of aids world wide religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different religion those weren t real believers they just claimed to be believers as some sort of excuse what makes a real believer there are so many one true religions it s hard to tell look at christianity there are many competing groups all convinced that they are the only true christians sometimes they even fight and kill each other how is an atheist supposed to decide who s a real christian and who isn t when even the major christian churches like the catholic church and the church of england can t decide amongst themselves in the end most atheists take a pragmatic view and decide that anyone who calls himself a christian and uses christian belief or dogma to justify his actions should be considered a christian maybe some of those christians are just perverting christian teaching for their own ends but surely if the bible can be so readily used to support un christian acts it can t be much of a moral code if the bible is the word of god why couldn t he have made it less easy to misinterpret and how do you know that your beliefs aren t a perversion of what your god intended if there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the bible then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say so sorry but if someone claims that he believes in jesus and that he murdered others because jesus and the bible told him to do so we must call him a christian obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned but since nobody has ever proved that god does not exist it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs shared by all faiths are nonsense that does not hold because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much harder to disprove than negative ones nobody has ever proved that unicorns don t exist but that doesn t make it unlikely that they are myths it is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it is to hold a positive assertion by default of course weak atheists would argue that asserting nothing is better still well if atheism s so great why are there so many theists unfortunately the popularity of a belief has little to do with how correct it is or whether it works consider how many people believe in astrology graphology and other pseudo sciences many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in gods certainly in many primitive human societies religion allows the people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand of course there s more to religion than that in the industrialized world we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when there are perfectly adequate natural explanations religion may have started as a means of attempting to explain the world but nowadays it serves other purposes as well but so many cultures have developed religions surely that must say something not really most religions are only superficially similar for example it s worth remembering that religions such as buddhism and taoism lack any sort of concept of god in the christian sense of course most religions are quick to denounce competing religions so it s rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another what about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that god exists for every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god there is one who does not besides as has already been pointed out the truth of a belief is not determined by how many people believe it also it is important to realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the same way that theists view their religious leaders a famous scientist is only human she may be an expert in some fields but when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight many respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise so are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing not entirely it certainly indicates that the religion in question has properties which have helped it so spread so far the theory of memetics talks of memes sets of ideas which can propagate themselves between human minds by analogy with genes some atheists view religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes which spread by encouraging their hosts to convert others some memes avoid destruction by discouraging believers from questioning doctrine or by using peer pressure to keep one time believers from admitting that they were mistaken some religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by other memes of course in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with successful propagation of a meme religion is not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it any more than a disease is a good thing because of the number of people who have caught it even if religion is not entirely true at least it puts across important messages what are the fundamental messages of atheism there are many important ideas atheists promote the following are just a few of them don t be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some religions there is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules be especially sceptical of positive claims if you want your life to have some sort of meaning it s up to you to find it search for what is true even if it makes you uncomfortable make the most of your life as it s probably the only one you ll have it s no good relying on some external power to change you you must change yourself just because something s popular doesn t mean it s good if you must assume something assume something it s easy to test don t believe things just because you want them to be true and finally and most importantly all beliefs should be open to question thanks for taking the time to read this article mathew for information

re gospel dating in article mimsy umd edu mangoe cs umd edu charley wingate writes well john has a quite different not necessarily more elaborated theology there is some evidence that he must have known luke and that the content of q was known to him but not in a canonized form this is a new argument to me could you elaborate a little the argument goes as follows q oid quotes appear in john but not in the almost codified way they were in matthew or luke however they are considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of q as such and not an entirely different source assuming that he knew luke would obviously put him after luke and would give evidence for the latter assumption i don t think this follows if you take the most traditional attributions then luke might have known john but john is an elder figure in either case we re talking spans of time here which are well within the range of lifetimes we are talking date of texts here not the age of the authors the usual explanation for the time order of mark matthew and luke does not consider their respective ages it says matthew has read the text of mark and luke that of matthew and probably that of mark as it is assumed that john knew the content of luke s text the evidence for that is not overwhelming admittedly earlier manuscripts of john have been discovered interesting where and which how are they dated how old are they unfortunately i haven t got the info at hand it was i think in the late s or early s and it was possibly as old as ce when they are from about why do they shed doubt on the order on putting john after the rest of the three i don t see your point it is exactly what james felder said they had no first hand knowledge of the events and it obvious that at least two of them used older texts as the base of their account and even the association of luke to paul or mark to peter are not generally accepted well a genuine letter of peter would be close enough wouldn t it sure an original together with id card of sender and receiver would be fine so what s that supposed to say am i missing something and i don t think a one step removed source is that bad if luke and mark and matthew learned their stories directly from diciples then i really cannot believe in the sort of big transformation from jesus to gospel that some people posit in news reports one generally gets no better information than this and if john is a diciple then there s nothing more to be said that john was a disciple is not generally accepted the style and language together with the theology are usually used as counterargument the argument that john was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospel of john itself is there any other evidence for it one step and one generation removed is bad even in our times compare that to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies not even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources it is also obvious that mark has been edited how old are the oldest manuscripts to my knowledge which can be antiquated the oldest is quite after any of these estimates and it is not even complete the only clear editing is problem of the ending and it s basically a hopeless mess the oldest versions give a strong sense of incompleteness to the point where the shortest versions seem to break off in midsentence the most obvious solution is that at some point part of the text was lost the material from verse on is pretty clearly later and seems to represent a synopsys of the end of luke in other words one does not know what the original of mark did look like and arguments based on mark are pretty weak but how is that connected to a redating of john benedikt
